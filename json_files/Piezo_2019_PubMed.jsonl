{"title": "Effect of Nano-hydroxyapatite and platelet-rich fibrin covered by the amniotic membrane on osseointegration after mandibular piezoelectric ridge splitting.", "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the clinical and radiographic findings obtained by using amniotic membrane (AM) to cover nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) bone grafts coated with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and thereby evaluate the osseointegration of posterior mandibular implants inserted simultaneously during alveolar piezoelectric ridge splitting technique (RST).\nA prospective cohort study was implemented with thirty patients who had a narrow posterior mandibular alveolar ridge and required implant restoration. Patients were distributed randomly into three groups (group I treated by piezoelectric RST and immediate implant insertion, augmented by the nHA bone graft only; group II treated by piezoelectric RST augmented by nHA bone graft and covered by AM; while group III was treated by piezoelectric RST augmented with PRF and nHA graft and covered by AM). Patients were evaluated clinically to assess the implant stability quotient (ISQ) and radiographically to assess horizontal ridge dimension, crestal bone level (CBL), and bone densitometric (BD) parameters.\nISQ results showed a non-significant clinical difference between groups while CBL values showed a high statistically significant difference over the 12-month interval when comparing groups III and II with group I. BD outcomes showed statistically significant differences at all intervals in comparisons of group III with groups I and II.\nThe results of this study suggest that concomitant use of PRF with nHA graft covered with AM for augmentation around the dental implant in a narrow posterior mandible after piezoelectric alveolar ridge splitting accelerate osseointegration and significantly increase bone density around the osseointegrated implant and decrease bone resorption in comparison to that achieved with the graft alone.", "journal": "The Saudi dental journal", "date": "2021-01-22", "authors": ["AlaaAbdelqader Altaweel", "AbdelAziz Baiomy Abdullah Baiomy", "ShadiaAbdel-Hameed Elsayed"], "doi": "10.1016/j.sdentj.2019.11.008\n10.1097/01.omx.0000515465.79426.e0\n10.1016/S0020-1383(16)47010-5\n10.1016/J.BJOMS.2008.11.012\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2005.07.009\n10.1080/08977190802636713\n10.1111/j.1600-051X.2008.01269.x\n10.1097/01.omx.0000444061.56326.e8\n10.1016/S0022-3913(08)60070-0\n10.1111/j.1600-0501.2010.02127.x\n10.1093/gerona/62.7.707\n10.1016/S0301-2115(00)00345-6\n10.1111/cid.12146\n10.1002/jbm.a.32452\n10.1016/J.JCMS.2011.04.020"}

Sixty-three patients (44 males, 19 females) who presented with bilaterally asymptomatic impacted mandibular third molars were included in this analysis. Each patient was treated, at two separate sessions approximately 4\u00a0weeks apart, with a conventional rotatory hand piece on one side of the mandible and a piezoelectric device on the contralateral side. Patients were followed up on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 15 to rate the pain, swelling and trismus. Inferior alveolar nerve paresthesia was evaluated up to 12\u00a0months postoperatively.\nThe severity of the pain, trismus and swelling using the piezosurgery were significantly different from the rotary group. In both groups, pain was most intense and peaked during the first post-operative day, while swelling and trismus reached peak levels on the third postoperative day. The piezoelectric procedure resulted in a significantly longer procedural duration compared to the rotatory surgery (\nPiezoelectric surgery is considered a viable alternative technique compared to the conventional rotary systems and can improve a patient's quality of life.

{"title": "Acoustic Poration and Dynamic Healing of Mammalian Cell Membranes during Inkjet Printing.", "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of piezoelectric actuating voltage on cell behavior after drop on demand inkjet printing using mouse 3T3 cells as a model cell line. Cell viability after printing was assessed using a live/dead assay, Alamar Blue as an assay for cell proliferation, and propidium iodide (PI) and Texas Red labeled dextran molecular probes to assess cell membrane integrity. No significant difference was found for the cell death rate compared between an unprinted control population and after printing at 80, 90, and 100 V, respectively. However, cell proliferation was lower than that of the control population at all time points postprinting. Cell membrane integrity was quantified using PI and dextran probes of mean molecular weight of 3, 10, 40, and 70 kDa. Total membrane damage (assessed by PI) increased with increasing piezoelectric actuator driving voltage, and this was always greater than the unprinted control cells. The uptake of the labeled dextran only occurs after inkjet printing and was never observed with the control cells. The largest dextran molecular probe of 70 kDa was only taken up by cells after printing using the lower printing voltages of 80 and 90 V and was absent after printing at 100 V. At the two lower printing voltages, the membrane damage is recovered, and no dextran molecule penetrated the cells 2 h after printing. However, printing at 100 V leads to an increased uptake of 3 and 10 kDa dextran molecules, the retention of membrane porosity, and continued uptake of these 3 and 10 kDa dextran for greater than 2 h postprinting. We hypothesize that the change in membrane porosity with increasing actuation voltage can be explained by distinct nucleation and growth stages for pore formation in response to printing stress.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2021-01-20", "authors": ["SrimantaBarui", "Rachel ESaunders", "SharmisthaNaskar", "BikramjitBasu", "BrianDerby"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01635"}

In this study, we first develop a facile and straightforward flow synthesis strategy to control zinc oxide (ZnO) of different shapes (sphere, ellipsoid, short rod, long rod, cube, urchin, and platelet) on a few seconds time scale, based on the 1.5-run spiral-shaped microfluidic reactor with a relative short microchannel length of ca. 92 mm. The formation of ZnO is realized simply by mixing reactants through two inlet flows, one containing zinc nitrate and the other sodium hydroxide. The structures of ZnO are tuned by choosing appropriate flow rates and reactant concentrations of two inlet fluids. The formation mechanism behind microfluidics is proposed. The photocatalysis, cytotoxicity, and piezoelectric capabilities of as-synthesized ZnO from microreactors are further examined, and the structure-dependent efficacy is observed, where higher surface area ZnO structures generally behave better performance.

In this paper we explore using a piezo actuated microscope stage to reproduce Brownian motion. Our goal is to use this as a tool to test performance of single particle tracking optical microscopes and estimation algorithms. In this study, Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the ability of piezo actuated microscope stages for reproducing Brownian motion. Surprisingly, the dynamics of the stage together with configuration of the system allow for preservation of the Brownian motion statistics. Further, feed forward model inverse control allows for low error tracking of Brownian motion trajectories over a wide range of diffusion constants, varying stage response times, and trajectory discrete time steps.

It plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular pH, antioxidation, and energy metabolism, which are further involved in fatigue. However, its function and mechanism in maintaining the physiological function of muscles or antifatigue are still ambiguous. We hypothesized that changes of CAIII in skeletal muscles might be related to the occurrence of muscle fatigue.\nAfter establishing a rat soleus muscle fatigue model, we measured the protein expression of the CAIII in muscles. And the muscle intracellular biochemical indices [malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and lactic acid] were also measured using assay kits. After transfected by CAIII-overexpressing and knockdown lentiviral vectors, the rat soleus muscles were induced to fatigue to investigate the effects and possible molecular mechanisms of CAIII in antifatigue.\nThe expression of CAIII in fatigued soleus muscles was significantly decreased compared with that of the control group (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). Moreover, the ATP level in the fatigued muscle also significantly decreased, whereas lactic acid and MDA levels were significantly increased (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). After posttransfection for 21 days, CAIII levels in muscles were significantly reduced in the CAIII-interfering lentivirus group, but increased in the CAIII-overexpressed lentivirus group (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.001). In addition, CAIII knockdown muscles showed more reduction of the maximal muscle force and ATP levels\u00a0\u200band more increase of MDA and lactic acid levels during the fatigue test than the control group, (P\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05).

A total of 98 bilateral single implants were placed in 49 patients. For each patient, traditional drilling technique was used at one side (control) and ultrasonic technique was used at the other side (test). Prior to insertion all implants were carefully embedded in liquid plasma rich in growth factors. Clinical and radiographic results were assessed after three years of function. The same implant success rate (95.9%) was recorded for both groups in a three year follow up, with only two implants lost per group. At the last follow-up the mean peri-implant bone loss was 0.42 \u00b1 0.14 mm and 0.33 \u00b1 0.13 mm in the control and test group, respectively. The difference was significant (P<0.001). In conclusion, ultrasonic technique for implant site preparation showed similar clinical performance but better preservation of the peri-implant bone. Together with the known characteristics of safety and reduced bleeding at the surgical site the ultrasonic technique represents a valuable alternative to traditional drilling.", "journal": "Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents", "date": "2020-05-20", "authors": ["MMozzati", "GGallesio", "RPol", "ACipollina", "AGiacalone", "NMucciacito", "MGalli", "LKaranxha", "AGreco Lucchina", "MDel Fabbro"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Piezoelectric nylon-11 nanoparticles with ultrasound assistance for high-efficiency promotion of stem cell osteogenic differentiation.", "abstract": "Stem cell differentiation plays a significant role in tissue repair and regeneration. The interaction between stem cells and physical signals mediated by materials has significant influence on the fate of stem cells. The utilization of the stimulation originating from material physical properties to promote stem cell differentiation is being developed and has attracted much attention. However, it is difficult to induce electric signals into tissues noninvasively. In this study, piezoelectric nylon-11 nanoparticles (nylon-11 NPs) with uniform morphology were synthesized in mass production by a simple anti-solvent method. The prepared nylon-11 NPs possessed efficient piezoelectricity and high cytocompatibility. Fluorescent OPDA-coated nylon-11 NPs could image dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) well, which demonstrated that nylon-11 NPs can be endocytosed easily by DPSCs. With the assistance of ultrasound, nylon-11 NPs could promote the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs efficiently in a noninvasive way. Meanwhile, nylon-11 NPs could also promote the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs to a certain extent. Therefore, piezoelectric nylon-11 NPs with the assistance of ultrasound will have enormous potential in tissue engineering, especially in stem cell fate regulation by noninvasive stimulation. This indicates that nanomaterial-mediated physical signals can regulate stem cell differentiation efficiently.", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

{"title": "Quantitative assessment of compress-type osseointegrated prosthetic implants in human bone using electromechanical impedance spectroscopic methods.", "abstract": "Osseointegrated (OI) prostheses are a promising alternative to traditional socket prostheses. They can enhance the quality of life of amputees by avoiding fit and comfort issues commonly associated with sockets. The main structural element of the OI prosthesis is a biocompatible metallic implant that is surgically implanted into the bone of the residual limb. The implant is designed to provide a conducive surface for the host bone to osseointegrate with. The osseointegration process of the implant is difficult to clinically evaluate, leading to conservative postoperative rehabilitation approaches. Elastic stress waves generated in an OI prosthesis have been previously proposed to interrogate the implant-bone interface for quantitative assessment of the osseointegration process. This paper provides a detailed overview of the various elastic stress wave methods previously explored for in situ characterization of OI implants. Specifically, the paper explores the use of electromechanical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to assess the OI process in compress-type OI prostheses. The EIS approach measures the electrical impedance spectrum of lead zirconate titanate elements bonded to the free end of the implant. The research utilizes both numerical simulation and experimental verification to establish that the electromechanical impedance spectrum is sensitive (between 400 and 460\u00a0kHz) to both the degree and location of osseointegration. A baseline-free OI index is proposed to quantify the degree of osseointegration at the implant-bone interface and to assess the stability of the OI implant for clinical decision making.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering letters", "date": "2020-03-17", "authors": ["WentaoWang", "Jerome PLynch"], "doi": "10.1007/s13534-019-00139-3\n10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.005\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2775100\n10.1007/s00113-017-0339-9\n10.1682/JRRD.2004.08.0134\n10.1302/0301-620X.96B1.31905\n10.1007/s10439-017-1976-4\n10.1007/s41669-017-0032-5\n10.1016/j.apmr.2013.05.020\n10.2106/JBJS.15.00808\n10.1177/0309364611409795\n10.1080/03093640308726667\n10.5435/00124635-200600001-00043\n10.1007/s11999-009-0946-z\n10.3390/s19030454\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2370945\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.08.016\n10.1177/1475921717732331\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2007.00397.x\n10.1007/s11012-013-9740-9\n10.1097/01.sap.0000189620.45708.5f\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.558.386\n10.1002/stc.1843\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.05.020\n10.1177/1475921718782399\n10.2514/3.9792\n10.1177/1045389X9700800406\n10.1177/1475921716655498\n10.1007/s00264-007-0392-z\n10.1016/j.bone.2006.06.001\n10.1016/j.bone.2009.04.249\n10.1002/stc.2171\n10.1002/mame.200800170\n10.1016/j.tca.2015.08.008"}

{"title": "Quantitative Comparison of the Performance of Piezoresistive, Piezoelectric, Acceleration, and Optical Pulse Wave Sensors.", "abstract": "The accurate measurement of the arterial pulse wave is beneficial to clinical health assessment and is important for the effective diagnosis of many types of cardiovascular disease. A variety of sensors have been developed for the non-invasive detection of these waves, but the type of sensor has an impact on the measurement results. Therefore, it is necessary to compare and analyze the signals obtained under a range of conditions using various pulse sensors to aid in making an informed choice of the appropriate type. From the available types we have selected four: a piezoresistive strain gauge sensor (PESG) and a piezoelectric Millar tonometer (the former with the ability to measure contact force), a circular film acceleration sensor, and an optical reflection sensor. Pulse wave signals were recorded from the left radial, carotid, femoral, and digital arteries of 60 subjects using these four sensors. Their performance was evaluated by analyzing their susceptibilities to external factors (contact force, measuring site, and ambient light intensity) and by comparing their stability and reproducibility. Under medium contact force, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the signals was higher than that at high and low force levels and the variability of signal waveform was small. The optical sensor was susceptible to ambient light. Analysis of the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the pulse wave parameters showed that the tonometer and accelerometer had good stability (ICC > 0.80), and the PESG and optical sensor had moderate stability (0.46 < ICC < 0.86). Intra-observer analysis showed that the tonometer and accelerometer had good reproducibility (ICC > 0.75) and the PESG and optical sensor had moderate reproducibility (0.42 < ICC < 0.91).

The results constitute a systematic quantitative investigation of the vibroequilibria effect, which refers to the reorientation of vibrated fluids in response to the inhomogeneous oscillatory velocity field and the accompanying dynamic pressure. This effect is amplified in microgravity where the restoring force of gravity is small or absent. Here the vibrations are transmitted via a pair of piezoelectric ceramics and a cantilever beam, excited in a resonant mode. The first and second resonances exhibit different types of motion and lead to different types of vibroequilibria surfaces, one with a dip or crater in the interior and the other flattened compared to the unforced reference experiment. The general tendency for interfaces to orient more perpendicular, on average, to the vibrational axis is confirmed. In the case of water in a cuboidal container, a quantitative comparison is made with vibroequilibria theory and with direct simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations.

{"title": "Multi-Ring Ultrasonic Transducer on a Single Piezoelectric Disk For Powering Biomedical Implants.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel ultrasonic transmitter with the ability of focusing ultrasonic waves for maximum power transmission at different depths for brain neurostimula-tor implants. The most important advantages of the proposed multi-ring ultrasonic transducer (MRUT) is its simplicity and no requirement of any lens or air cavity for focusing the ultrasonic waves. Furthermore, adjusting the focal point compared to the conventional transducers is significantly easier, especially as the location of implants may vary due to, for example, head movement or the need of using these implants at different depths. By the use of multiple rings on a single piezoelectric disk in our transducer, not only more focused ultrasound beams can be achieved, but also the side lobes can be diminished by exciting each rings with different electrical signal. The proposed transmitter is envisioned to be used for optogenetic stimulation of neurons in freely-moving animals.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "PI-Sole: A Low-Cost Solution for Gait Monitoring Using Off-The-Shelf Piezoelectric Sensors and IMU.", "abstract": "In this paper, viability of low-cost off-the-shelf Piezoelectric ceramic disc elements is explored for an insole-based gait monitoring system, `PI-Sole' (Piezo In-Sole). Piezoelectric elements can sense dynamic changes in pressure in a closed-loop environment with good sensitivity and a wide measurement range. In this paper, method to enable these elements to continuously sense plantar pressure while walking is proposed, making them a very cost-efficient alternative to the widely used Force Sensing Resistors (FSR) and pressure plates for monitoring human gait. However, piezoelectric elements show hysteresis in their force response, inducing a drift in calculated pressure which increases with time. A novel and effective method to perform detrending of the signal is also presented utilizing stride contexts from a 6-DoF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the same is utilized to perform zero-correction in the pressure data. 3-D trajectories of strides are calculated using the IMU, and parameters like stride length, stride height etc. are further derived. In order to test the validity of our proposed methods, important kinetic parameters like Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) and Center of Pressure (CoP) are calculated using PI-Sole and compared to the ones calculated using FSR's in multiple prior works. Applicability of PI-Sole is demonstrated further by depicting and analysing characteristic differences between a heel-strike toe-off stance type, and a flat-strike stance type, the latter being one of the primary symptoms in many cases of pathological gait, including Parkinsonian gait. Important artefacts from foot's height profile while walking are analysed for both stance types in context of standard gait events. We report a mean error of 2.8cm in stride length calculation, and a mean accuracy of 94.5% in calculating swing/stance duration of gait cycles.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The purpose of this study was to directly compare outcomes in external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) using a piezoelectric ultrasonic bone aspirator (UBA) versus a high-speed electric drill with a diamond burr.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted on 145 consecutive patients who underwent external DCR by a single oculoplastic surgeon between 2012 and 2017. Collected data included baseline patient characteristics, presenting symptoms, operative details and complications, and postoperative symptoms.\nOne hundred and seventy-three primary external DCRs performed on 145 patients were included in this study. In total, 61.3% of cases were performed with the UBA and 38.7% with the high-speed drill. Most patients were white (92.4%) and female (67.6%), with a mean age of 57.6 years (range 1-93). Surgical success was achieved in 94.3% of patients in the UBA group and 94.0% in the drill group, with no significant differences between the two arms (\nThe UBA offers comparable outcomes and complication rates to more conventional surgical tools for external DCR.

An experimental setup and its corresponding measurement approaches for the transient responses are designed. The launch range of the object resulting from the first contact-impact is measured through laser doppler vibrometer and the motion process is captured by high-speed camera. Experimental results illustrate that the launch range increases firstly and decreases subsequently as the frequency of the sine driving voltage increases. Meanwhile, considering the local viscoelastic contact deformation, a theoretical methodology including the mechanics model for the driving process is proposed. Based on the Lagrange equations of second kind, the governing equation of the driving system is derived. Transient responses are calculated using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration method. Contact forces and Poisson's coefficient of restitution are calculated by the proposed theoretical method. The results of launch range show that the theoretical solutions have a good agreement with the experimental data. The peak value of contact force increases firstly and decreases subsequently with the increase of voltage frequency.

{"title": "Static Electromechanical Characteristic of a Three-Layer Circular Piezoelectric Transducer.", "abstract": "The paper presents research related to the functional features of a novel three-layer circular piezoelectric actuator/sensor. The outer layers of the transducer are made of non-piezoelectric material. The middle layer comprises two elements-a piezoelectric disk, and a ring made of non-piezoelectric material. The additional external passive layer has a very important function; it protects the transducer's electrical components against damage caused by external factors. Also, if sparking on the transducer wires or electrodes occurs, this layer prevents fire. So far, there is no analytical model for such a transducer. Closed-form analytical equations are important tools for predicting and optimizing the operation of devices. Thus, using both the Plate Theory and constitutive equations of piezoelectric materials, an analytical formula describing transducer deflection as a function of electrical loads has been found (electromechanical characteristic of the transducer). In addition, it is worth noting that under certain assumptions, the developed analytical model can also be used for two-layer transducers. The tests carried out show satisfactory compliance of the results obtained through the developed solution with both literature data and numerical data. Moreover, based on the obtained analytical model, the effect of selected non-dimensional variables on the actuator performance has been examined. These parameters include dimensions and mechanical properties of both piezoelectric disk and passive plates and strongly influence the behavior of the transducer.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-01-08", "authors": ["GrzegorzMieczkowski", "AndrzejBorawski", "DariuszSzpica"], "doi": "10.3390/s20010222\n10.3390/s19214668\n10.3390/s18124491\n10.1016/S0924-4247(00)00518-5\n10.3390/computation6040060\n10.1016/S0924-4247(97)01401-5\n10.2478/ama-2019-0025\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.02.029\n10.1109/58.808857\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.11.034\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2007.07.022\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.03.051\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2013.10.012\n10.5755/j01.mech.22.4.12764\n10.15632/jtam-pl.55.1.69\n10.5755/j01.mech.24.3.17953\n10.1016/S0924-4247(03)00006-2\n10.1121/1.383958\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/023\n10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2553\n10.1023/A:1020560114319\n10.17531/ein.2015.1.1\n10.3103/S1068366618060089\n10.3846/16484142.2016.1149884\n10.1177/0037549719835920\n10.5755/j01.mech.21.6.11147\n10.1016/S0924-4247(01)00680-X"}
{"title": "Reliability Analysis of an Epileptic Seizure Detector Powered by an Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "Due to a limited lifetime of a battery, energy harvesters have been studied as alternative energy sources for implantable biomedical devices such as an implantable stimulator for epileptic seizure suppression. However, energy harvesters have weakness in providing stable power. We designed a neural recording circuit powered solely by a piezoelectric energy harvester, and applied its output to a seizure detector to analyze the reliability of the recorded signal. Performance of the seizure detector was evaluated. We found that the average time differences between with and without voltage variances were about 0.05 s under regular vibrations and about 0.07 s under irregular vibrations, respectively. The ratio of average true positive alarm period varied within about 0.02% under regular vibrations and 0.029% under irregular vibrations, respectively.

The design of an efficient APT system requires accurate models to describe its individual components as well as the interaction between them. Most of the analytical models available to represent the bulk piezoelectric transducers used in APT are limited to either thin rod or thin plate transducers. However, transducers with moderate aspect ratios are often used, especially at the receiver end. In this work, in addition to reviewing standard theories, models based on the Rayleigh and Bishop rod theories are developed to analyze transducers [transmitter (TX) or receiver (RX)] with various aspect ratios. Results from these models are compared with experimental data and finite-element analysis to determine the range of aspect ratios in which they are valid. In addition, fluid loading effects on the predictions of all models are investigated, and the generated pressure fields by the transducers with different aspect ratios are compared. The resulting models are used to analyze the effect of aspect ratio on the performance of the transducer when operated as a TX or an RX in an APT setting.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2020-01-04", "authors": ["AhmedAllam", "Karim GSabra", "AlperErturk"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2962711"}

The harvester comprises of a cylindrical oscillator attached to a piezoelectric MEMS device. Wind tunnel experiments are conducted to measure the power output of the energy harvester. Additionally, the energy harvester is placed within a formation of up to 25 cylinders to test whether the vortex interactions of multiple cylinders in formation can enhance the power output. Experiments show power output in the nanowatt range, and the energy harvester within a formation of cylinders yield noticeably higher power output compared to the energy harvester in isolation. A more detailed investigation conducted using computational fluid dynamics simulations indicates that vortices shed from upstream cylinders introduce large periodic transverse velocity component on the incoming flow encountered by the downstream cylinders, hence increasing VIV response. For the first time, the use of formation effect to enhance the wind energy harvesting at microscale has been demonstrated.

{"title": "Sliding Mode Control with Dynamical Correction for Time-Delay Piezoelectric Actuator Systems.", "abstract": "In piezoelectric actuators (PEAs), which suffer from inherent nonlinearities, sliding mode control (SMC) has proven to be a successful control strategy. Nonetheless, in micropositioning systems with time delay, integral proportional control (PI), and SMC, feedback control schemes have a tendency to overcompensate and, consequently, high controller gains must be rejected. This may produce a slow and inaccurate response. This paper presents a novel control strategy that deals with time-delay micropositioning systems aimed at achieving precise positioning by combining an open-loop control with a modified SMC scheme. The proposed SMC with dynamical correction (SMC-WDC) uses the dynamical system model to adapt the SMC inputs and avoid undesirable control response caused by delays. In order to develop the SMC-WDC scheme, an exhaustive analysis on the micropositioning system was first performed. Then, a mixed control strategy, combining inverse open-loop control and SMC-WDC, was developed. The performance of the presented control scheme was analyzed and compared experimentally with other control strategies (i.e., PI and SMC with saturation and hyperbolic functions) using different reference signals. It was found that the SMC-WDC strategy presents the best performance, that is, the fastest response and highest accuracy, especially against sudden changes of reference setpoints (frequencies >10 Hz). Additionally, if the setpoint reference frequencies are higher than 10 Hz, high integral gains are counterproductive (since the control response increases the delay), although if frequencies are below 1 Hz the integral control delay does not affect the system's accuracy. The SMC-WDC proved to be an effective strategy for micropositioning systems, dealing with time delay and other uncertainties to achieve the setpoint command fast and precisely without chattering.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2020-01-02", "authors": ["JavierVelasco", "OscarBarambones", "IsidroCalvo", "JosebaZubia", "IdurreSaez de Ocariz", "AnderChouza"], "doi": "10.3390/ma13010132\n10.1109/TASE.2014.2352364\n10.4236/mme.2013.31001\n10.1007/s00170-011-3827-z\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.05.032\n10.1016/j.isatra.2014.10.005\n10.1016/j.rcim.2016.08.011\n10.1063/1.2185500\n10.3390/ma9020071\n10.1109/TCST.2009.2028878\n10.3390/ma5122465\n10.3390/ma11060918\n10.5194/ms-6-15-2015\n10.1016/j.physb.2016.01.008\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2009.03.006\n10.1109/TMECH.2012.2194301\n10.1109/TIE.2008.926768\n10.1109/TMECH.2008.2006756\n10.1049/iet-cta:20060371\n10.3390/en12050943\n10.1109/TMECH.2017.2701417\n10.3390/app9132625\n10.3390/app9102023\n10.1109/TCST.2013.2293401\n10.3390/electronics8040398\n10.1109/TIE.2019.2921272\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.004\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2019.03.004\n10.1109/TCST.2016.2569567"}

CPEs provide naked eye detection possibility by their superior optical properties however, as concentration of target analytes decrease, trace amounts of nucleic acid typically yield colorimetric responses that are not readily perceivable by naked eye. Herein, we report a pixelated analysis approach for correlating colorimetric responses of CPE with nucleic acid concentrations down to 1\u00a0nM, in plasma samples, utilizing a smart phone with an algorithm that can perform analytical testing and data processing. The detection strategy employed relies on conformational transitions between single stranded nucleic acid-cationic CPE duplexes and double stranded nucleic acid-CPE triplexes that yield distinct colorimetric responses for enabling naked eye detection of nucleic acids. Cationic poly[N,N,N-triethyl-3-((4-methylthiophen-3-yl)oxy)propan-1-aminium bromide] is utilized as the CPE reporter deposited on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for nucleic acid assay. A smart phone application is developed to capture and digitize the colorimetric response of the individual pixels of the digital images of CPE on the PVDF membrane, followed by an analysis using the algorithm. The proposed pixelated approach enables precise quantification of nucleic acid assay concentrations, thereby eliminating the margin of error involved in conventional methodologies adopted for interpretation of colorimetric responses, for instance, RGB analysis.

By virtue of the inherently high piezoelectric coefficient of PZT material and high aspect ratio of PZT nanofibers, the composite film (75 wt% PZT nanofibers) presents high force-electric conversion capability and high sensitivity.

{"title": "Polyvinyl alcohol modified polyvinylidene fluoride-graphene oxide scaffold promotes osteogenic differentiation potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering is fast becoming a key approach in bone medicine studies. Designing the ideally desirable combination of stem cells and scaffolds are at the hurt of efforts for producing implantable bone substitutes. Clinical application of stem cells could be associated with serious limitations, and engineering scaffolds that are able to imitate the important features of extracellular matrix is a major area of challenges within the field. In this study, electrospun scaffolds of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), PVDF-graphene oxide (GO), PVDF-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PVDF-PVA-GO were fabricated to study the osteogenic differentiation potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) while cultured on fabricated scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy study, viability assay, relative gene expression analysis, immunocytochemistry, alkaline phosphates activity, and calcium content assays confirmed that the osteogenesis rate of hiPSCs cultured on PVDF-PVA-Go is significantly higher than other scaffolds. Here, we showed that the biocompatible, nontoxic, flexible, piezoelectric, highly porous and interconnected three-dimensional structure of electrospun PVDF-PVA-Go scaffold in combination with hiPSCs (as the stem cells with significant advantageous in comparison to other types) makes them a highly promising scaffold-stem cell system for bone remodeling medicine. There was no evidence for the superiority of PVDF-GO or PVDF-PVA scaffold for osteogenesis, compared to each other; however both of them showed better potentials as to PVDF scaffold.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2019-12-31", "authors": ["EsmaeelAzadian", "BaharArjmand", "AbdolrezaArdeshirylajimi", "SimzarHosseinzadeh", "MeisamOmidi", "ArashKhojasteh"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.29585"}
{"title": "Full noncontact laser ultrasound: first human data.", "abstract": "Full noncontact laser ultrasound (LUS) imaging has several distinct advantages over current medical ultrasound (US) technologies: elimination of the coupling mediums (gel/water), operator-independent image quality, improved repeatability, and volumetric imaging. Current light-based ultrasound utilizing tissue-penetrating photoacoustics (PA) generally uses traditional piezoelectric transducers in contact with the imaged tissue or carries an optical fiber detector close to the imaging site. Unlike PA, the LUS design presented here minimizes the optical penetration and specifically restricts optical-to-acoustic energy transduction at the tissue surface, maximizing the generated acoustic source amplitude. With an appropriate optical design and interferometry, any exposed tissue surfaces can become viable acoustic sources and detectors. LUS operates analogously to conventional ultrasound but uses light instead of piezoelectric elements. Here, we present full noncontact LUS results, imaging targets at ~5\u2009cm depths and at a meter-scale standoff from the target surface. Experimental results demonstrating volumetric imaging and the first LUS images on humans are presented, all at eye- and skin-safe optical exposure levels. The progression of LUS imaging from tissue-mimicking phantoms, to excised animal tissue, to humans in vivo is shown, with validation from conventional ultrasound images.

{"title": "Application of Piezo-Based Measuring System for Evaluation of Nucleic Acid-Based Drugs Influencing the Coagulation.", "abstract": "During open-heart surgery, the status of hemostasis has to be constantly monitored to quickly and reliably detect bleeding or coagulation disorders. In this study, a novel optimized piezo-based measuring system (PIEZ) for rheological monitoring of hemostasis was established. The applicability of the PIEZ for the evaluation of nucleic acid-based drugs influencing coagulation was analyzed. Thrombin aptamers such as NU172 might be used during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in combination with a reduced heparin concentration or for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Therefore, the effect of the coagulation inhibiting thrombin aptamer NU172 and the abrogation by its complementary antidote sequence (AD) were investigated by this rheological PIEZ system. After the addition of different NU172 concentrations, the coagulation of fresh human blood was analyzed under static conditions and using an in vitro rotation model under dynamic conditions (simulating ECC). The clotting times (CTs) detected by PIEZ were compared to those obtained with a medical reference device, a ball coagulometer. Additionally, after the circulation of blood samples for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, blood cell numbers, thrombin markers (thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) and fibrinopeptide A (FPA)) and a platelet activation marker (\u03b2-thromboglobulin (\u03b2-TG)) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The increase of NU172 concentration resulted in prolonged CTs, which were comparable between the reference ball coagulometer and the PIEZ, demonstrating the reliability of the new measuring system. Moreover, by looking at the slope of the linear regression of the viscous and elastic components, PIEZ also could provide information on the kinetics of the coagulation reaction. The shear viscosity at the end of the measurements (after 300 s) was indicative of clot firmness. Furthermore, the PIEZ was able to detect the abrogation of coagulation inhibition after the equimolar addition of NU172 aptamer\u00b4s AD. The obtained results showed that the established PIEZ is capable to dynamically measure the hemostasis status in whole blood and can be applied to analyze nucleic acid-based drugs influencing the coagulation.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-12-29", "authors": ["Silju-JohnKunnakattu", "LudmillaHann", "JuliaKurz", "HannaHaag", "StefanFennrich", "NicoleRauch", "ChristianSchlensak", "Hans-PeterWendel", "SandraStoppelkamp", "MeltemAvci-Adali"], "doi": "10.3390/s20010152\n10.5339/gcsp.2013.32\n10.1016/j.thromres.2013.12.007\n10.1097/MAT.0000000000000256\n10.1080/10903127.2018.1532475\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.11.017\n10.1111/jth.14264\n10.3390/molecules22060954\n10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.06.001\n10.7150/thno.10257\n10.1038/nature00963\n10.1038/nbt1023\n10.1111/j.1538-7836.2012.04679.x\n10.1016/j.tmrv.2006.03.003\n10.1152/physrev.00016.2011\n10.1097/MBC.0b013e32830f1b68\n10.1364/BOE.5.000817\n10.1122/1.1917843\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.05.070\n10.3389/fbioe.2018.00099\n10.1039/c0lc00182a\n10.1038/srep05445\n10.1186/1757-7241-21-20\n10.1111/bjh.13930\n10.1002/ajh.23599\n10.1016/j.tmrv.2011.07.005\n10.1074/jbc.M111.300772\n10.5482/ha-1156"}

{"title": "Design of a Compliant Mechanism Based Four-Stage Amplification Piezoelectric-Driven Asymmetric Microgripper.", "abstract": "The existing symmetrical microgrippers have larger output displacements compared with the asymmetrical counterparts. However, the two jaws of a symmetrical microgripper are less unlikely to offer the same forces on the two sides of a grasped micro-object due to the manufacture and assembly errors. Therefore, this paper proposes a new asymmetric microgripper to obtain stable output force of the gripper. Compared with symmetrical microgrippers, asymmetrical microgrippers usually have smaller output displacements. In order to increase the output displacement, a compliant mechanism with four stage amplification is employed to design the asymmetric microgripper. Consequently, the proposed asymmetrical microgripper possesses the advantages of both the stable output force of the gripper and large displacement amplification. To begin with, the mechanical model of the microgripper is established in this paper. The relationship between the driving force and the output displacement of the microgripper is then derived, followed by the static characteristics' analysis of the microgripper.

{"title": "A Direction Self-Tuning Two-Dimensional Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester.", "abstract": "Most work from the last decade on the piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (PVEHs) focuses on how to increase its frequency bandwidth but ignores the effect of vibration direction on the output performance of the harvester. However, both the frequency and the direction of the vibration in a real environment are time-variant. Therefore, improving the capability of PVEH to harvest multi-directional vibration energy is also important. This work presents a direction self-tuning two-dimensional (2D) PVEH, which consists of a spring-mass system and a direction self-tuning structure. The spring-mass system is sensitive to external vibration, and the direction self-tuning structure can automatically adjust its plane perpendicular to the direction of the external excitation driven by an external torque. The direction self-tuning mechanism is first theoretically analyzed. The experimental results show that this direction self-tuning PVEH can efficiently scavenge vibration energy in the 2D plane, and its output performance is unaffected by vibration direction and is very stable. Meanwhile, the effect of the initial deflection angle and the vibration acceleration on the direction self-tuning time of the PVEH is investigated. The direction self-tuning mechanism can also be used in other PVEHs with different energy conversion methods for harvesting multi-direction vibration energy.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-12-28", "authors": ["HaiboZhao", "XiaoxiangWei", "YimingZhong", "PeihongWang"], "doi": "10.3390/s20010077\n10.1002/adma.201707271\n10.1063/1.5083910\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111820\n10.1177/1045389X15590274\n10.1007/s00542-009-0827-0\n10.1063/1.5053945\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2792686\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.053\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.068\n10.1021/acsnano.8b04654\n10.1038/s42005-019-0117-9\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.261\n10.1063/1.4923456\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.02.025\n10.1063/1.4830371\n10.1063/1.4981885\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.03.038\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/12/125011\n10.1063/1.5024567\n10.3390/s19183845\n10.1063/1.4940417\n10.1177/1045389X19828820\n10.1063/1.4972188\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.09.036\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.006\n10.1063/1.3595278\n10.1016/j.jpcs.2018.02.024\n10.1063/1.4936607\n10.1063/1.4984895\n10.1063/1.5001803"}

To replace the inorganic rigid indium-tin oxide (ITO) conducting coating commonly used in the nanogenerator devices, a series of flexible polyaniline-based conducting copolymers underlying the perpendicularly-oriented ZnO nanorod arrays has been synthesized with improved electric conductivity by the copolymerization of aniline and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomers in order to optimize the piezoelectric current collection efficiency of the devices. It is found that significantly higher conductivity can be obtained by small addition of EDOT monomer into aniline monomer solution using an in-situ oxidative polymerization method for the synthesis of the copolymer coatings. The highest conductivity of aniline-rich copolymer is 65 S/cm, which is 2.5 times higher than that for homopolymer polyaniline coating. Subsequently, perpendicularly-oriented ZnO nanorod arrays are fabricated on the polyaniline-based copolymer substrates via a ZnO nanoparticle seeded hydrothermal fabrication process. The surface morphology, crystallinity, orientation, and crystal size of the synthesized ZnO nanorod arrays are fully examined with various synthesis parameters for copolymer coatings with different monomer compositions. It is found that piezoelectric current generated from the devices is at least five times better for the device with improved electric conductivity of the copolymer and the dense formation of ZnO nanorod arrays on the coating.

Herein, the LAFS probe measurement characteristics by auto-searching the FES method can be analyzed, which can then realize non-contact measurement and focus detection of micro-displacements. Therefore, we have successfully designed a low-cost, high-precision auto-focusing thickness measurement system with linear piezoelectric nano-positioning. To verify the proposed method, some transparent specimens were evaluated, and the thicknesses were rapidly and successfully measured. Experiments confirm the validity of the proposed system, and the results show that the method is effective for the thickness measurement of transparent plates.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2019-12-25", "authors": ["QuangsangVo", "YitingDuan", "XiaodongZhang", "FengzhouFang"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.58.009524"}

MAH was found to be miscible with PVDF by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) investigations provided positive evidence for the specific interaction between the carbonyl groups of MAH and the methylene groups of PVDF. Rheological measurements showed that both the storage modulus and the melt viscosity of PVDF increase with the addition of MAH, followed by a decrease with excess MAH. In addition, the elongation of the PVDF/MAH blend with 10 wt % MAH is 589.7%, which is almost 5 times that of neat PVDF. It is concluded that MAH small molecules act as physical \"crosslinking\" points for the neighboring PVDF molecule chains due to this specific interaction between PVDF and MAH.

Communication between implantable components and between deep implants and the outside world can be challenging. Percutaneous wired connectivity is undesirable and both radiofrequency and optical methods are limited by tissue absorption and power safety limits. As such, there is a significant potential niche for ultrasound communications in this domain. In this paper, we present the design and testing of a reliable and efficient ultrasonic communication telemetry scheme using piezoelectric transducers that operate at 320 kHz frequency. A key challenge results from the multi-propagation path effect. Therefore, we present a method, using short pulse sequences with relaxation intervals. To counter an increasing bit, and thus packet, error rate with distance, we have incorporated an error correction encoding scheme. We then demonstrate how the communication scheme can scale to a network of implantable devices. We demonstrate that we can achieve an effective, error-free, data rate of 0.6 kbps, which is sufficient for low data rate bioelectronic medicine applications.

The MSPI model, which is fitted together by each segment, can further improve the fitting accuracy of the outer-loop hysteresis nonlinearity, while describing the inner-loop hysteresis nonlinearity perfectly.

{"title": "Investigation of Piezoelectricity and Resistivity of Surface Modified Barium Titanate Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Polymer-ceramic nanocomposite piezoelectric and dielectric films are of interest because of their possible application to advanced embedded energy storage devices for printed wired electrical boards. The incompatibility of the two constituent materials; hydrophilic ceramic filler, and hydrophobic epoxy limit the filler concentration, and thus, their piezoelectric properties. This work aims to understand the role of surfactant concentration in establishing meaningful interfacial layers between the epoxy and ceramic filler particles by observing particle surface morphology, piezoelectric strain coefficients, and resistivity spectra. A comprehensive study of nanocomposites, comprising non-treated and surface treated barium titanate (BTO), embedded within an epoxy matrix, was performed. The surface treatments were performed with two types of coupling agents: Ethanol and 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilan. The observations of particle agglomeration, piezoelectric strain coefficients, and resistivity were compared, where the most ideal properties were found for concentrations of 0.02 and 0.025. This work demonstrates that the interfacial core-shell processing layer concentration influences the macroscopic properties of nanocomposites, and the opportunities for tuning interfacial layers for desirable characteristics of specific applications.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-12-22", "authors": ["UdhaySundar", "ZichenLao", "KimberlyCook-Chennault"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11122123\n10.1177/147592170200100104\n10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2000)6:4(153)\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/4/043001\n10.1007/s10832-013-9834-8\n10.1007/s10832-011-9638-7\n10.1177/2041731418800101\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.12.034\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.090\n10.1115/1.1400751\n10.1063/1.2163978\n10.1109/TCAPT.2005.859740\n10.1109/6040.846650\n10.1016/S1359-835X(00)00141-X\n10.1177/0583102404043275\n10.1039/c2ee22251e\n10.1177/0270467608325374\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1989.tb06070.x\n10.1109/MEI.2010.5482787\n10.1002/adma.200601996\n10.1021/am302646z\n10.1039/C7DT02846F\n10.1063/1.126787\n10.1116/1.4955315\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2009.10.005\n10.1021/ja0422155\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104529\n10.1109/TDEI.2010.5539688\n10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00260-6\n10.1080/10584580601099025\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.02.005\n10.1038/nature03028\n10.1143/JJAP.32.4272\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2009.06.050\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.05.001\n10.1166/mex.2017.1393\n10.1109/TDEI.2013.004165\n10.1038/nmat2206\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2000.tb01560.x\n10.1177/0734904107083309\n10.1179/095066001771048763\n10.1002/polb.10453\n10.1109/TADVP.2003.811365\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2010.03.027\n10.1021/am200492q\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.12.228\n10.1039/c2jm30542a\n10.1021/nn9006412\n10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00004-6\n10.1080/03602550500373543\n10.1002/app.24938\n10.1002/app.24894\n10.1002/mame.200390035\n10.1163/156855498X00045\n10.1177/0021998310394694\n10.1007/s10965-010-9478-1\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.05.021\n10.3390/act6030024\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2011.09.060\n10.1016/S0927-7757(97)00234-3\n10.1016/0166-6622(88)80125-2\n10.1021/i360065a002\n10.1016/S1359-835X(03)00202-1\n10.1016/j.mseb.2004.01.022\n10.1063/1.2338529\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00154.x\n10.1143/JJAP.30.2247\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1991.tb07165.x\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2004.11.006\n10.1007/s10853-006-0984-9\n10.1080/10584580601098589\n10.1080/00150193.2011.554146\n10.1023/A:1013182602054\n10.1038/srep09953\n10.1109/TDEI.2013.004166"}
{"title": "Viscosity monitoring during hemodiluted blood coagulation using optical coherence elastography.", "abstract": "Rapid and accurate clot diagnostic systems are needed for the assessment of hemodiluted blood coagulation. We develop a real-time optical coherence elastography (OCE) system, which measures the attenuation coefficient of a compressional wave induced by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) in a drop of blood using optical coherence tomography (OCT), for the determination of viscous properties during the dynamic whole blood coagulation process. Changes in the viscous properties increase the attenuation coefficient of the sample. Consequently, dynamic blood coagulation status can be monitored by relating changes of the attenuation coefficient to clinically relevant coagulation metrics, including the initial coagulation time and the clot formation rate. This system was used to characterize the influence of activator kaolin and the influence of hemodilution with either NaCl 0.9% or hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% on blood coagulation. The results show that PZT-OCE is sensitive to coagulation abnormalities and is able to characterize blood coagulation status based on viscosity-related attenuation coefficient measurements. PZT-OCE can be used for point-of-care testing for diagnosis of coagulation disorders and monitoring of therapies.", "journal": "IEEE journal of selected topics in quantum electronics : a publication of the IEEE Lasers and Electro-optics Society", "date": "2019-12-21", "authors": ["XiangqunXu", "JiangZhu", "JunxiaoYu", "ZhongpingChen"], "doi": "10.1109/JSTQE.2018.2833455"}

One of them is the technique used to prepare the root end cavities which is conventionally being done with burs. In past decades, ultrasonic instruments have been introduced for the same. Studies comparing these instruments on root surface integrity are scarce. Thus, an in-vitro Scanning Electron Microscopy study was designed to evaluate the surface integrity of root end cavities prepared using conventional and piezoelectric devices.\nTwelve single-rooted human intact mandibular premolar teeth were endodontically treated and included in the study. They were divided into two groups. In the first group, 3 mm root-end cavities were prepared using conventional retro preparation burs and in the second group, 3 mm root-end cavities were prepared using piezoelectric retro-tips. The specimens were coded for blind evaluation and analysed under scanning electron microscope at 100x, 500x and 1000x magnification for smear layer and debris. Gutmann's scoring criteria was followed to score the specimens. Statistical analysis was carried out using Shapiro Wilk test and the independent sample t-test was used to check mean differences between variables.\nIt was noted that significant statistical differences existed in mean debris and smear layer scores (p< 0.001) between the two groups. In the piezoelectric group, significantly lower debris layer and smear layer was found, compared to the conventional bur group.\nRoot-end cavities prepared using piezo retrotips produced cleaner, well-centered and more conservative surface with minimal debris & smear layer, compared to root-end cavities prepared using conventional burs.", "journal": "Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research", "date": "2019-12-20", "authors": ["Mithra NHegde", "Manjiri NageshHonap", "SreenathNarayanan"], "doi": "10.4103/ijdr.IJDR_237_18"}

{"title": "Monte Carlo Study of Electronic Transport in Monolayer InSe.", "abstract": "The absence of a band gap in graphene makes it of minor interest for field-effect transistors. Layered metal chalcogenides have shown great potential in device applications thanks to their wide bandgap and high carrier mobility. Interestingly, in the ever-growing library of two-dimensional (2D) materials, monolayer InSe appears as one of the new promising candidates, although still in the initial stage of theoretical studies. Here, we present a theoretical study of this material using density functional theory (DFT) to determine the electronic band structure as well as the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon matrix elements. The electron-phonon scattering rates are obtained using Fermi's Golden Rule and are used in a full-band Monte Carlo computer program to solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to evaluate the intrinsic low-field mobility and velocity-field characteristic. The electron-phonon matrix elements, accounting for both long- and short-range interactions, are considered to study the contributions of different scattering mechanisms. Since monolayer InSe is a polar piezoelectric material, scattering with optical phonons is dominated by the long-range interaction with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons while scattering with acoustic phonons is dominated by piezoelectric scattering with the longitudinal (LA) branch at room temperature (T = 300 K) due to a lack of a center of inversion symmetry in monolayer InSe. The low-field electron mobility, calculated considering all electron-phonon interactions, is found to be 110 cm", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-12-19", "authors": ["SanjayGopalan", "GautamGaddemane", "Maarten L Van dePut", "And Massimo VFischetti"], "doi": "10.3390/ma12244210\n10.1016/j.ssc.2008.02.024\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.016602\n10.1103/PhysRevB.98.115416\n10.1088/2053-1583/1/2/025001\n10.1038/nnano.2014.35\n10.1021/nn501226z\n10.1038/ncomms5475\n10.1063/1.5037581\n10.1063/1.3595682\n10.1021/am501022x\n10.3390/ma12182935\n10.1063/1.4860988\n10.1109/TED.2014.2313065\n10.1088/1367-2630/16/9/095002\n10.1039/C8TA01943F\n10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.114010\n10.1103/PhysRevB.85.115317\n10.1103/PhysRevB.90.045422\n10.1103/PhysRevB.92.075405\n10.1103/PhysRevB.93.035414\n10.1088/1361-6528/aa8b39\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.1133\n10.1103/PhysRev.158.383\n10.1103/PhysRevB.93.155413\n10.1002/adma.201402427\n10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b01356\n10.3390/nano9010082\n10.1186/s11671-019-3113-9\n10.1002/adma.201802990\n10.3390/nano7110372\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b04799\n10.1039/C7CP03558F\n10.1039/C7CY00090A\n10.7567/APEX.9.035203\n10.1038/s41565-017-0035-5\n10.1088/0953-8984/21/39/395502\n10.1088/1361-648X/aa8f79\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865\n10.1103/PhysRevB.45.13244\n10.1103/PhysRevB.88.085117\n10.1103/RevModPhys.73.515\n10.1016/j.cpc.2016.07.028\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.176401\n10.1080/00018735400101213\n10.1103/PhysRev.144.390\n10.1103/RevModPhys.55.645\n10.1103/PhysRevB.80.224301\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.2.393\n10.1007/s12274-015-0878-8\n10.1016/0038-1101(77)90054-5\n10.1039/C7NR07779C\n10.1063/1.1358321\n10.1063/1.3524569\n10.1063/1.4928559\n10.1088/2053-1583/2/1/011002"}

It has been verified that temperature greatly affects the accuracy of moisture sensing. Moisture sensing performance would suffer without temperature calibrations.

An adaptive algorithm is designed to automatically find the optimal order number, which was subsequently applied in a nonlinear mathematical model to compensate for the temperature effects and improve the moisture measurement accuracy.

{"title": "A Guided Wave Inspection Technique for Wedge Features.", "abstract": "Numerous engineering components feature prismatic wedge-like structures that require nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in order to ensure functionality or safety. This article focuses on the inspection of the wedge-like seal fins of a jet engine drum, though the capabilities presented will be generic. It is proposed that antisymmetric flexural edge modes, feature-guided waves localized to the wedge tips, may be used for defect detection. Although analytical solutions exist that characterize the ultrasonic behavior of ideal wedges, in practice, real wedges will be irregular (containing, for example, truncated tips that are built onto an associated structure or have nonstraight edges), and therefore, generic methodologies are required to characterize wave behavior in nonideal wedges. This article uses a semianalytical finite-element (SAFE) methodology to characterize the guided waves in wedge-like features with irregular cross sections to assess their suitability for NDE inspection and compare them with edge modes in ideal wedges. The science and methodologies required in this article are necessary to select an appropriate operating frequency for the particular application at hand. In addition, this article addresses the practical challenge of excitation and detection of flexural edge modes by presenting a piezoelectric-based dry-coupled transducer system suitable for pulse-echo operation. This article, therefore, presents the scientific basis required for industrial exploitation, together with the practical tools that facilitate use.

{"title": "PFOM fillers embedded PVDF/cellulose dual-layered membranes with hydrophobic-hydrophilic channels for desalination ", "abstract": "In this research work, novel perfluorooctanoic acid-modified melamine (PFOM) was synthesized as a hydrophobic filler using a facile one-pot synthesis. PFOM incorporating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) solution was cast on a cellulose sheet to prepare a dual-layered membrane employing the phase-inversion technique for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) application. The influence of PFOM to tailor the dual-layered membrane performance was then investigated. The long perfluoro chain in PFOM hydrophobic fillers increased the surface roughness of the membranes due to its random overlapping with PVDF backbone, and these membranes exhibited a higher water contact angle value.

BC nanofilms significantly improve the sensitivity of PEI films to formaldehyde gas, and reduces response and recovery times. The BC films have superfine filamentary and fibrous network structures, which provide a large number of attachment sites for the PEI particles. Measurement results obtained using in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the primary amino groups of PEI strongly adsorb formaldehyde molecules through nucleophilic reactions, thus resulting in a negative frequency shift of the SAW sensor due to the mass loading effect. In addition, experimental results showed that the frequency shifts of the SAW devices are determined by thickness of PEI film, concentration of formaldehyde and relative humidity. The PEI/BC sensor coated with three layers of PEI as the sensing layer showed the optimal sensing performance, which had a frequency shift of 35.6 kHz for 10 ppm formaldehyde gas, measured at room temperature and 30 % RH.

A mechanically-flexible linear 64-element array of piezoelectric transducers with a resonance frequency of 5\u00a0MHz was designed for nerve localization. A second 8-element array using larger elements was integrated on the wearable probe for low intensity focused ultrasound neuromodulation at a resonance frequency of 1.3\u00a0MHz. Full-wave simulations were used to model the flexible arrays and estimate their generated pressure profiles. A focal depth of 10-20\u00a0mm was assumed for beamforming and focusing to support modulation of the vagus, tibial, and other nerves. A strain sensor integrated on the probe provides patient-specific feedback information on array curvature for real-time optimization of focusing and image processing.

To date, published ultrasonically powered implants have been encapsulated with thin film polymers that are susceptible to well-documented failure modes in vivo, including water penetration and attack by the body. As with all medical implants, packaging with ceramic or metallic materials can reduce water vapor transmission and improve biostability to provide decadal device lifetime. In this paper, we evaluate methods of coupling ultrasonic energy to the interior of ceramic packages.\nThe classic wave approach and modal expansion are used to obtain analytical expressions for ultrasonic transmission through two different package designs and these approaches are validated experimentally. A candidate package design is demonstrated using alumina packages and titanium lids, designed to be acoustically transparent at ultrasonic frequencies.\nBulk modes are shown to be more effective at coupling ultrasonic energy to a piezoelectric receiver than flexural modes. Using bulk modes, packaged motes have an overall link efficiency of roughly 10%, compared to 25% for unpackaged motes. Packaging does not have a significant effect on translational misalignment penalties, but does increase angular misalignment penalties. Passive amplitude-modulated backscatter communication is demonstrated.\nThin lids enable the use of ultrasonically coupled devices even with package materials of very different acoustic impedance.\nThis work provides an analysis and method for designing packages that enable ultrasonic coupling with implantable medical devices, which could facilitate clinical translation.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2019-12-12", "authors": ["KonlinShen", "Michel MMaharbiz"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2019.2957732"}

The cytoskeletal organization of C2C12 myoblast cells grown on different PVDF samples was studied by immunofluorescence staining, and the interactions between single live cells and PVDF were analyzed using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique termed single-cell force spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that C2C12 myoblast cells seeded on samples with net surface charge present a more elongated morphology, this effect being dependent on the surface charge but independent of the poling direction (negative or positive surface charge). It was further shown that the cell deadhesion forces of individual C2C12 cells were higher on PVDF samples with an overall negative surface charge (8.92 \u00b1 0.45 nN) compared to those on nonpoled substrates (zero overall surface charge) (4.06 \u00b1 0.20 nN).

{"title": "Design, Analysis, and Experiment on a Novel Stick-Slip Piezoelectric Actuator with a Lever Mechanism.", "abstract": "A piezoelectric actuator using a lever mechanism is designed, fabricated, and tested with the aim of accomplishing long-travel precision linear driving based on the stick-slip principle. The proposed actuator mainly consists of a stator, an adjustment mechanism, a preload mechanism, a base, and a linear guide. The stator design, comprising a piezoelectric stack and a lever mechanism with a long hinge used to increase the displacement of the driving foot, is described. A simplified model of the stator is created. Its design parameters are determined by an analytical model and confirmed using the finite element method. In a series of experiments, a laser displacement sensor is employed to measure the displacement responses of the actuator under the application of different driving signals. The experiment results demonstrate that the velocity of the actuator rises from 0.05 mm/s to 1.8 mm/s with the frequency increasing from 30 Hz to 150 Hz and the voltage increasing from 30 V to 150 V. It is shown that the minimum step distance of the actuator is 0.875 \u03bcm.

{"title": "Characterization and Application of PVDF and Its Copolymer Films Prepared by Spin-Coating and Langmuir-Blodgett Method.", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers are key polymers, displaying properties such as flexibility and electroactive responses, including piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, and ferroelectricity. In the past several years, they have been applied in numerous applications, such as memory, transducers, actuators, and energy harvesting and have shown thriving prospects in the ongoing research and commercialization process. The crystalline polymorphs of PVDF can present nonpolar \u03b1, \u03b5 phase and polar \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 phases with different processing methods. The copolymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), can crystallize directly into a phase analogous to the \u03b2 phase of PVDF. Since the \u03b2 phase shows the highest dipole moment among polar phases, many reproducible and efficient methods producing \u03b2-phase PVDF and its copolymer have been proposed. In this review, PVDF and its copolymer films prepared by spin-coating and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method are introduced, and relevant characterization techniques are highlighted.

This model can be divided into two categories according to the input frequency: rate-independent type and rate-dependent type. A particle swarm optimization method (PSO) is employed to identify these parameters of the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. An inverse model feedforward compensator is established based on the modified Bouc-Wen model.

{"title": "Dry Coupling of Ultrasonic Transducer Components for High Temperature Applications.", "abstract": "The viability for dry coupling of piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer components was investigated, using a thin foil of annealed silver as a filler material/coupling agent at each component interface. Criteria used for room temperature evaluation were centered on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and echo bandwidth, for a Li-Nb based transducer operating in pulse-echo mode. A normal clamping stress of only 25 MPa, applied repeatedly over three loading cycles on a precisely-aligned transducer stack, was sufficient to yield backwall echoes with a SNR greater than 25 dB, and a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 65%. This compares to a SNR of 32 dB and a 3 dB bandwidth of 65%, achievable when all transducer interfaces were coupled with ultrasonic gel. The respective roles of a soft filler material, alignment of transducer components, cyclic clamping, component roughness, and component flatness were evaluated in achieving this high efficiency dry coupling, with transducer clamping forces far lower than previously reported.

{"title": "Grouting Quality Evaluation in Post-Tensioning Tendon Ducts Using Wavelet Packet Transform and Bayes Classifier.", "abstract": "The grouting quality of tendon ducts is very important for post-tensioning technology in order to protect the prestressing reinforcement from environmental corrosion and to make a smooth stress distribution. Unfortunately, various grouting defects occur in practice, and there is no efficient method to evaluate grouting compactness yet. In this study, a method based on wavelet packet transform (WPT) and Bayes classifier was proposed to evaluate grouting conditions using stress waves generated and received by piezoelectric transducers. Six typical grouting conditions with both partial grouting and cavity defects of different dimensions were experimentally investigated. The WPT was applied to explore the energy of received stress waves at multi-scales. After that, the Bayes classifier was employed to identify the grouting conditions, by taking the traditionally used total energy and the proposed energy vector of WPT components as input, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the Bayes classifier input with the energy vector could identify different grouting conditions more accurately. The proposed method has the potential to be applied at key spots of post-tensioning tendon ducts in practice.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-12-11", "authors": ["Xiang-TaoSun", "DanLi", "Wen-YuHe", "Zuo-CaiWang", "Wei-XinRen"], "doi": "10.3390/s19245372\n10.1680/iicep.1988.179\n10.1007/s12205-018-0091-x\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.04.009\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.05.212\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2018.05.013\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9a65\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.3390/s19030545\n10.1177/1045389X9800900305\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035035\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/3/020\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.02.107\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085021\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2018.06.002\n10.1177/1475921715586625\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.008\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109777\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.03.041\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80bc\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065026\n10.3390/s18072171\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.10.002\n10.3390/s16081343\n10.3390/s17102239\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.04.040\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.08.014\n10.1016/j.renene.2017.03.052\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab29b0\n10.1177/1475921718798622\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2790902\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2005.04.031\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2008)134:5(832)\n10.1016/j.ssci.2019.08.015\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.175\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/7/075001\n10.3390/s18051563\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.07.013\n10.1016/j.asoc.2012.03.021"}

Herein, a pair of smart insoles integrated with piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanogenerators (NGs) are fabricated to simultaneously harvest energy from human motion and monitor human gait signals. Multi-target magnetron sputtering technology is applied to form the aluminum electrode layers on the surface of the PVDF film and the self-powered insoles are fabricated through advanced 3D seamless flat-bed knitting technology. Output responses of the NGs are measured at different motion speeds and a maximum value of 41 V is obtained, corresponding to an output power of 168.1 \u03bcW. By connecting one NG with an external circuit, the influence of external resistance, capacitor, and motion speed on the charging characteristics of the system is systematically investigated. To demonstrate the potential of the smart insoles for monitoring human gait signals, two subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at different speeds or with a limp.

{"title": "Defect Visualization of a Steel Structure Using a Piezoelectric Line Sensor Based on Laser Ultrasonic Guided Wave.", "abstract": "We studied the detection and visualization of defects in a test object using a laser ultrasonic guided wave. The scan area is irradiated by a laser generated from a Nd:YAG 532 nm Q-switched laser generator through a galvanometer scanner. The laser irradiation causes the surface temperature to suddenly rise and then become temporarily adiabatic. The locally heated region reaches thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. In other words, heat energy propagates inside the object in the form of elastic energy through adiabatic expansion. This thermoelastic wave is typically acquired by a piezoelectric sensor, which is sensitive in the ultrasonic domain. A single piezoelectric sensor has limited coverage in the scan area, while multi-channel piezoelectric sensors require many sensors, large-scale wiring, and many channeling devices for use and installation. In addition, the sensors may not acquire signals due to their installed locations, and the efficiency may be reduced because of the overlap between the sensing areas of multiple sensors. For these reasons, the concept of a piezoelectric line sensor is adopted in this study for the first time. To verify the feasibility of the line sensor, I- and L-shaped sensors were attached to a steel structure, and the ultrasound signal from laser excitation was obtained. If the steel structure has defects on the back, the ultrasonic propagation image will be distorted in the defect area. Thus, we can detect the defects easily from the visualization image.

{"title": "Electric-Field-Driven Nanosecond Ferroelastic-Domain Switching Dynamics in Epitaxial Pb(Zr,Ti)O_{3} Film.", "abstract": "Epitaxial oxide ferroelectric films exhibit emerging phenomena arising from complex domain configurations even at pseudoequilibrium, including the creation of domain states unfavored in nature and abrupt piezoelectric coefficients around morphotropic phase boundaries. The nanometer-sized domain configurations and their domain switching dynamics under external stimuli are directly linked to the ultrafast manipulation of ferroelectric thin films; however, complex domain switching dynamics under homogeneous electric fields has not been fully explored, especially at the nanosecond timescale. This Letter reports the nanosecond dynamics of ferroelastic-domain switching from the 90\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 direction using time-resolved x-ray microdiffraction under homogeneous electric fields onto an epitaxial Pb(Zr_{0.35},Ti_{0.65})O_{3} film capacitor. It is found that the application of electric fields induces spatially heterogeneous domain switching processes via intermediate domain structures with rotated polarization vectors. In addition, the domain switching time is shown to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the applied electric field, and electric fields higher than 480\u2009\u2009kV/cm are found to complete the ferroelastic switching within nanoseconds.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2019-12-07", "authors": ["Hyeon JunLee", "TakaoShimizu", "HiroshiFunakubo", "YasuhikoImai", "OsamiSakata", "Seung HyunHwang", "Tae YeonKim", "ChangjaeYoon", "ChengDai", "Long QChen", "Su YongLee", "Ji YoungJo"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.217601"}

Measurements are performed with two piezoelectric transducers, housed in standard orthopedic screws and fixed on either side of simulated fractures, with and without an orthopedic plate, in ex vivo pig limb bones.

{"title": "Study on the Critical Wind Speed of a Resonant Cavity Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Driven by Driving Wind Pressure.", "abstract": "In order to solve the problem of continuous and stable power supply for vehicle sensors, a resonant cavity piezoelectric energy harvester driven by driving wind pressure was designed. The harvester has an effective working range of wind speed. According to the energy conservation law, the cut-in (initial) wind speed of the harvester was solved. The pressure distribution law of the elastic beam in the flow field was studied by the Fluent software package, and the results were loaded into a finite element model with a method of partition loading. The relationship between the wind speed and the maximum principal stress of the piezoelectric cantilever beam was analyzed, and the critical stress method was used to study the cut-out wind speed of the energy harvester. The results show that the cut-in wind speed of the piezoelectric energy harvester is 5.29 m/s, and the cut-out wind speed is 24 m/s. Finally, an experiment on the power generation performance of the energy harvester was carried out. The experimental results show that the cut-in and cut-out wind speeds of the piezoelectric energy harvester are 5 m/s and 24 m/s, respectively, and the best matching load is 60 k\u03a9. The average output power, generated by the harvester when the driving wind speed is 22 m/s, is 0.145 mW, and the corresponding power density is 1.2 mW/cm", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-12-07", "authors": ["XiaLi", "ZhiyuanLi", "QiangLiu", "XiaobiaoShan"], "doi": "10.3390/mi10120842\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113871\n10.1088/0957-4484/23/50/502001\n10.1109/MSSC.2010.936667\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.077\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2016.09.002\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.153\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.01.011\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.090\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.030\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.07.025\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.054\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2015.10.006\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.103\n10.1021/acsnano.8b04654\n10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2018.02.003\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.12.021\n10.1109/JMEMS.2008.2004854\n10.1109/TIM.2010.2089090\n10.1063/1.2119410\n10.1177/1045389X11400929\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/4/045003\n10.1177/1045389X11428366\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.03.219\n10.1063/1.3503609\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.034\n10.1063/1.4789433\n10.1063/1.3427405\n10.1016/j.compfluid.2016.11.014\n10.1006/jfls.2000.0367\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2009.03.016\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/031"}
{"title": "A Stable Anti-Fouling Coating on PVDF Membrane Constructed of Polyphenol Tannic Acid, Polyethyleneimine and Metal Ion.", "abstract": "A hydrophilic and anti-fouling coating layer was constructed on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) microfiltration membrane by a novel surface modification method. The pristine membrane was firstly coated by (3-chloropropyl) trimethoxysilane/polyethyleneimine and tannic acid. Then, the metal ion was induced on the coating layer to coordinate with tannic acid and polyethyleneimine, forming a more stable and hydrophilic coating on the surface. The membrane's surface morphology and chemical element analysis showed that the Tannic acid/ polyethyleneimine (TA/PEI) coating layer was denser and had more stability after the addition of metal ions, and this may be due to the coordination bond formed between the TA/PEI coating and metal ions. The results of the water contact angle and pure water flux measurements showed that the hydrophilicity and wettability of the modified membranes were improved obviously after introducing the metal ion layers. The anti-fouling performance and stability of the modified membrane were also characterized by the underwater oil contact angle (OCA), the separation efficiency, and the contact angle variation value for before and after the rinsing experiment. The modified membrane showed obvious stability and antifouling. Moreover, the retention rate of some composite membranes could reach 99.6%.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-12-07", "authors": ["LiliWu", "QiuhuLin", "CongLiu", "WanyuChen"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11121975\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.01.039\n10.1038/nature06599\n10.1002/app.42002\n10.1016/j.desal.2011.08.024\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.01.043\n10.1021/acsami.5b00978\n10.1016/j.memsci.2015.07.052\n10.1021/ie403456n\n10.1016/j.memsci.2010.06.057\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.006\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.11.052\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.01.053\n10.1016/j.seppur.2018.10.014\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.1126/science.1147241\n10.1007/s10126-007-9053-x\n10.1021/acsami.7b19865\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.10.008\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.02.039\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.010\n10.3390/polym11050780\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00105\n10.1021/am4008598\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2019.07.051\n10.1039/C6RA13634F\n10.1039/C7TB01639E\n10.2174/092986708786242778\n10.1016/j.memsci.2016.08.067\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b02454\n10.1016/j.cej.2016.06.044\n10.1039/C7CC02411H\n10.1016/j.cej.2017.10.065\n10.1016/j.dental.2012.02.009\n10.1016/j.memsci.2008.10.011\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.06.131\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.04.057"}

{"title": "Towards Wearable and Flexible Sensors and Circuits Integration for Stress Monitoring.", "abstract": "Excessive stress is one of the main causes of mental illness. Long-term exposure of stress could affect one's physiological wellbeing (such as hypertension) and psychological condition (such as depression). Multisensory information such as heart rate variability (HRV) and pH can provide suitable information about mental and physical stress. This paper proposes a novel approach for stress condition monitoring using disposable flexible sensors. By integrating flexible amplifiers with a commercially available flexible polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) mechanical deformation sensor and a pH-type chemical sensor, the proposed system can detect arterial pulses from the neck and pH levels from sweat located in the back of the body. The system uses organic thin film transistor (OTFT)-based signal amplification front-end circuits with modifications to accommodate the dynamic signal ranges obtained from the sensors. The OTFTs were manufactured on a low-cost flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate using a coater capable of Roll-to-Roll (R2R) deposition. The proposed system can capture physiological indicators with data interrogated by Near Field Communication (NFC). The device has been successfully tested with healthy subjects, demonstrating its feasibility for real-time stress monitoring.", "journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "date": "2019-12-06", "authors": ["Ching-MeiChen", "SalzitsaAnastasova", "KaiZhang", "Bruno GRosa", "Benny P LLo", "Hazel EAssender", "Guang-ZhongYang"], "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2019.2957444"}

The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to correlate between personalized template and the BCG signal. Heartbeats are detected by using the Hilbert Transform.

The phase transition is represented by the displacement of the middle-layer Te atoms from the center of the unit cell in the y-direction. The critical point for the phase transition is found to be at 0.5% biaxial tensile strain. By analyzing the bond variation and the phonon spectra, we attribute the phase transition to the decrease of the bonding strength at the tensile strain and the atom migration corresponding to the phonon vibration mode along the distorted direction. The transition to the \u03b1-phase under strain is further confirmed from the calculated electronic band structure where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a large Rashba splitting due to symmetry breaking, which may enable the control of spin via the electric field. Two-dimensional ferroelectrics can be formed upon transition of the strain-induced \u03b2-phase to the \u03b1-phase, and a high polarization of about 90 \u03bcC cm", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-12-05", "authors": ["XueruCai", "YangyangRen", "MenghaoWu", "DongweiXu", "XiaobingLuo"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr06507e"}
{"title": "Synergistic osteogenesis promoted by magnetically actuated nano-mechanical stimuli.", "abstract": "Functional biomaterials with magnetic properties are considerably useful for regulating cell behavior and promoting bone regeneration. And the combination of such biomaterials with physical environmental cues (such as magnetic fields and mechanical stress) might be more favorable for the regulation of cell function. This study is aimed at investigating the combined effects of magnetically responsive materials and a static magnetic field (SMF) on the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts and the potential mechanism involved. In this study, oleic acid modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IO-OA NPs) were utilized to generate homogeneous magnetic nanocomposites with poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) used as the base and to enhance the mechanical properties of the composites. In vitro experimental results show that in the presence of an external SMF, cell attachment and osteogenic differentiation were significantly improved using the IO-OA/PLGA composites, as indicated by enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, increased mineralized nodule formation, and upregulated bone-associated gene expression (ALP, OCN, and BMP2), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the upregulated expression levels of piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1), a key receptor for sensing mechanical stimuli, implied that the synergistically enhanced osteogenic differentiation was mainly caused as a result of the mechanical stimuli. Such magnetically actuated mechanical stimuli were induced through the nano-deformation of the magnetic substrate under a SMF, which was directly characterized via in situ scanning using atomic force microscopy (AFM). This study demonstrates that magnetically actuated nano-mechanical stimuli may underpin the synergistic effects of magnetic composites and magnetic stimuli to enhance osteogenic differentiation, and they could form the basis of a potential strategy to accelerate bone formation for bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-12-05", "authors": ["LiliHao", "LinlongLi", "PengWang", "ZongliangWang", "XincuiShi", "MinGuo", "PeibiaoZhang"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr07170a"}
{"title": "Shape memory alloy actuation of non-bonded piezo sensor configuration for bone diagnosis and impedance based analysis.", "abstract": "In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in research community towards the application of smart materials for bio-medical structural health monitoring. Amongst the smart materials, directly bonded piezo sensors (DBPS), based on the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique, have been successfully employed for the above purpose. The principle behind the EMI technique is that high frequency excitations (typically >\u200930\u00a0kHz) generated by a surface bonded PZT patch are used to detect changes in structural drive point impedance caused by cracks or any other type of damage. Bone healing and damage have been shown to be successfully monitored using the DBPS. However, in most of the diagnostic cases of live human and animal subjects, directly bonding a PZT patch is always an irritant or hazard for a live subject. To circumvent direct bonding, the authors have developed and experimentally demonstrated a non-bonded piezo sensor (NBPS) configuration as a good alternative to DBPS while maintaining the effectiveness of measurement well within discernible limits. This paper presents further improvement in the NBPS configuration aiming at autonomous operation of the gripping mechanism using shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The experiments are performed on replicas of femur bone in healthy and osteoporosis state. This paper shows the effective use of SMA clamping for bone identification and its damage assessment in comparison to earlier mechanical gripping using jubilee clamps. This paper also covers impedance based identification applied to SMA and clamp based NBPS configurations.

However, maintaining the satisfactory activity of inkjet printed enzyme is a challenging task due to the requirements of ink rheology and printhead parameters. Thus to find optimum inkjetting conditions we studied the effects of several ink formulation and jetting parameters on lysozyme activity using a piezoelectric printhead. Within linear activity range of protein concentrations ink containing 50\u2009\u00b5g/mL lysozyme showed a satisfactory activity retention of 85%. An acceptable activity of jetted ink was found at pH 6.2 and ionic strength of 0.06 molar. Glycerol was found to be an effective viscosity modifier (10-15 mPa.s), humectant and protein structure stabilizer for the prepared ink. A non-ionic surfactant when used just below critical micelle concentration was found to be favourable for the jetted inks. An increase in activity retention was observed for inks jetted after 24\u2009hours of room temperature incubation. However, no additional activity was seen for inkjetting above the room temperature.

{"title": "Design of a Novel Two-Directional Piezoelectric Energy Harvester With Permanent Magnets and Multistage Force Amplifier.", "abstract": "This article presents the design and testing of a novel two-directional (2-D) piezoelectric stack-based energy harvester for capturing the mechanical energy from the human footstep. The uniqueness of the harvester lies in the fact that the energy of 2-D excitation is scavenged by a single piezoelectric stack transducer, which can reduce the loss of harvestable energy. The harvester is constructed by the integration of permanent magnets, position protection plates, and multistage force amplification frame. The input force and input displacement are restricted to guarantee the device's safety. The reported multistage force amplification frame with leverage mechanism and bridge-type amplifier enlarges the force acting on the piezoelectric stack, which further improves the power output. A linear guiding mechanism based on leaf flexure is applied to minimize the impact of input forces in other than moving directions. Through analytical modeling, the main architectural parameters of the device are determined. Simulation study with finite-element analysis is conducted to optimize the device parameters for achieving the largest force amplification ratio with a high safety factor. A prototype harvester is fabricated for experimental study.

The Rayleigh wave is widely used for detecting these surface defects. For replacing piezoelectric transducers with electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for the surface inspection of metal materials, this article proposes a new magnet and coil combination consisting of a periodic-permanent-magnet (PPM) and a returned dislocation meander line coil. The returned dislocation meander line coil was developed using a traditional meander line coil, whose wires return from one side to another and shift for a certain distance. A 2-D finite-element simulation was conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed Rayleigh wave EMAT. The simulation results revealed that, compared with a large conventional magnet, the PPM increased the maximum magnetic flux density, and made the magnetic flux density distribution more concentrated on the specimen's surface, particularly below the coil. In the middle part of the coil, the PPM greatly increased the intensity of the horizontal magnetic field. Additionally, the returned dislocation meander line coil made full use of the strong magnetic field below the center of each small magnet and at the adjacent magnets. The designed Rayleigh wave EMAT was fabricated, and the experimental results revealed that the new design of the Rayleigh wave EMAT increased the received signal by 57.9% compared with the conventional Rayleigh wave EMAT.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-12-05", "authors": ["HongjunSun", "TetsuyaUchimoto", "ToshiyukiTakagi"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2956711"}

{"title": "Compensating for source directivity in immersive wave experimentation.", "abstract": "A physical boundary mounted with active sources can cancel acoustic waves arriving at the boundary, and emit synthesized waves into the neighboring medium to fully control the acoustic wavefield in an experimental setup such as a water tank or air-filled cavity. Using the same principles, a physical experiment can be artificially immersed within an extended virtual (numerical) domain so that waves propagate seamlessly between the experimental setup and virtual domain. Such an immersive wave control experiment requires physical monopolar sources on the active boundary. However, real physical sources (e.g., piezoelectric transducers) project waves at middle-to-high sonic frequencies (e.g., 1-20 kHz) that do not fully conform to the theoretically required monopolar radiation pattern; if left uncorrected, this causes controlled wavefields to deviate from those desired in immersive experiments. A method is proposed to compensate for the non-monopole-like radiation patterns of the sources, and can be interpreted physically in terms of Huygens principle. The method is implemented as a pre-computation procedure that modifies the extrapolation Green's functions in the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral before the actual experiments take place. Two-dimensional finite-difference simulations show that the processing method can effectively suppress the undesired effect caused by non-monopolar active sources in immersive wave control experiments.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2019-12-05", "authors": ["XunLi", "JohanRobertsson", "AndrewCurtis", "Dirk-Janvan Manen"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5131029"}

The methods applied in the research are well-known: the fixed threshold-based method and the adaptive two-extreme-peak detection method.

Such samples can be processed into small pieces and then injected, either by fragmenting the gel by passing it repeatedly through a syringe, or drying the entire gel slice and grinding it into a powder. Injections using the whole gel fragment should only be used with larger animals such as rabbits. For mice or other small animals, electroelution or electrophoretic transfer of the protein should be used to prepare the protein for injection. In the latter method, the protein is transferred to a suitable membrane, such as nitrocellulose or PVDF. The location of the desired protein is identified by staining, and the protein band is then cut from the surrounding membrane, minced, and dissolved in a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide before subcutaneous injection into the animal.", "journal": "Cold Spring Harbor protocols", "date": "2019-12-04", "authors": ["Edward AGreenfield", "JamesDeCaprio", "MohanBrahmandam"], "doi": "10.1101/pdb.prot100008"}
{"title": "Roles of TRPV4 and piezo channels in stretch-evoked Ca", "abstract": "Chondrocyte mechanotransduction is not well understood, but recently, it has been proposed that mechanically activated ion channels such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), Piezo1, and Piezo2 are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction. The aim of this study was to distinguish the potential contributions of TRPV4, Piezo1, and Piezo2 in transducing different intensities of repetitive mechanical stimulus in chondrocytes. To study this, TRPV4-, Piezo1-, or Piezo2-specific siRNAs were transfected into cultured primary chondrocytes to knock down (KD) TRPV4, Piezo1, or Piezo2 expression, designated TRPV4-KD, Piezo1-KD, or Piezo2-KD cells. Then we used Flexcell\u00ae Tension System to apply cyclic tensile strains (CTS) of 3% to 18% at 0.5\u2009Hz for 8\u2009h to the knockdown and control siRNA-treated cells. Finally, using a Ca\nChondrocytes in cartilage are constantly subjected to load-induced stimuli and regulate their metabolic activities in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. Therefore, mechanotransduction is important in chondrocytes and is vital for their role in cartilage function. Our results indicate that chondrocytes might sense and distinguish the different intensities of repetitive mechanical stimulus by using different mechanosensitive ion channels. Specifically, TRPV4 is mainly responsible for sensing physiologic levels of repetitive CTS stimulus, while Piezo2 mainly contributes to chondrocyte sensing noxious levels of repetitive CTS loading. These results provide a basis for further examination of mechanotransduction in cartilage and raise the possibility of therapeutically targeting Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction for the treatment of OA which is induced by injurious and repetitive mechanical stimulation.", "journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "date": "2019-12-04", "authors": ["GenlaiDu", "LiLi", "XinwangZhang", "JianbingLiu", "JianqingHao", "JianjunZhu", "HaoWu", "WeiyiChen", "QuanyouZhang"], "doi": "10.1177/1535370219892601"}

To solve the contradiction between high accuracy and large working space, a novel non-resonant piezoelectric linear actuator, which adopted the two parallel v-shaped stators as the double driving feet, was proposed, and both its working principle and structure were discussed in detail. The actuator was used to drive the positioning stage directly to obtain the performance of nano-positioning and large working stroke. The experiment results show that the resolution of the actuator is 0.015\u2009\u03bcm, and its stable maximum motion speed is 17.4\u2009mm/s, while the degree-of-freedom of step resolution of teach nano-positioning stage is 0.018\u2009\u03bcm, 0.016\u2009\u03bcm, and 0.3\u2009\u03bcrad, respectively.

{"title": "l-Cysteine-Modified Acacia Gum as a Multifunctional Binder for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.", "abstract": "A binder plays an important role in stabilizing the electrode structure and improving the cyclic stability of batteries. However, the traditional binders are no longer satisfactory in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because of their failure in accommodating the large volume changes of sulfur and trapping soluble intermediate polysulfides, thus causing severe capacity decay. In this work, we prepared a multifunctional binder for Li-S batteries by merely modifying the acacia gum (AG), a low-cost biomass polymer, with l-cysteine under mild conditions. Owing to the introduced amino and carboxyl branches by the l-cysteine, the modified AG shows enhanced polysulfide trapping ability and can effectively restrain the shuttling of polysulfides. In addition, the introduction of branches can help form a cross-linked 3D network with better mechanical strength and flexibility for adhering sulfur and accommodating the volume changes of cathode materials. As a result, compared with the normally used polyvinylidene fluoride binder and the unmodified AG binder, the l-cysteine-modified AG binder effectively enhanced the rate capability and cycling stability of the Li-S batteries directly using sulfur as the cathode, showing a promising way to prompt the practical use of Li-S batteries.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-11-30", "authors": ["QiQi", "YaqianDeng", "SichenGu", "MinGao", "Jun-YaHasegawa", "GuangminZhou", "XiaohuiLv", "WeiLv", "Quan-HongYang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b17458"}

However, the positioning accuracy is severely affected by the hysteresis characteristics of piezoelectric ceramics. Piezoelectric stack actuators (PSAs) are usually composed of hundreds of thin piezoelectric ceramic layers connected in parallel, and their hysteresis quantity is the accumulation of that in each layer, which results in large nonlinear deformation. A new driving method is proposed for PSAs to drive each layer independently, and all the layers are driven in sequence. The independent driving logic is analyzed, and the scheme of the driving circuit is presented to replace the traditional voltage amplifier, which guarantees that there is no need to change the original driving signal. Experimental results show that the hysteresis of a homemade seven-layer PSA is reduced from approximately 12.5% to 2.7% compared with the traditional parallel driving method in various frequencies.

The aim of the present study was to assess tissue changes induced by different CA glues used for mesh fixation in an animal model.\nParietal defects were induced in the abdominal wall of 60 rats and repaired by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh fixation using different CA glues. At 1, 7, 15, and 30\u00a0days post-surgery, macroscopic and histopathological studies were performed to evaluate mesh adhesion, the presence of complications and the tissue response.\nAll meshes were successfully fixed without signs of inflammatory reaction, displacement or detachment. In areas where CA adhesives were applied, the acute tissue response was limited and transient. At 7\u00a0days post-surgery, collagen fibril production around prosthetic materials was observed, and collagen maturation was achieved at 30\u00a0days post-surgery. Good mesh incorporation was detected with all three glues, but the application of Glubran-2 was associated with an early macrophagic response and the early production and maturation of collagen fibrils.\nOur study confirmed that CA tissue adhesives induced the good incorporation of prosthetic mesh within host tissue with a low incidence of complications and reduced acute tissue reaction. At 30\u00a0days post-surgery no signs of mesh disinsertion or migration were observed, the prosthetic mesh adhesion was due to the presence of a dense mature connective tissue rich in type I collagen fibres.", "journal": "Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery", "date": "2019-11-28", "authors": ["APoli", "FParisi", "FMillanta", "LSolfanelli", "PGarc\u00eda-Pastor", "CMagliaro", "VMiragliotta", "SBurchielli"], "doi": "10.1007/s10029-019-02078-5\n10.1056/nejm200008103430603\n10.1007/s10029-011-0856-3\n10.1053/slas.2001.24087\n10.1016/j.jss.2009.11.710\n10.1002/jbm.b.33558\n10.1002/bjs.7334\n10.1007/s00464-009-0767-x\n10.1016/j.jss.2016.09.021\n10.1055/s-2003-41365\n10.1016/j.ciresp.2009.05.004\n10.1007/s00268-013-2140-4\n10.1002/14651858.cd008954.pub2\n10.1097/md.0000000000010423\n10.1016/j.jss.2010.05.003\n10.1177/1553350609337128\n10.1007/s10856-017-5869-8\n10.1007/s00464-010-1244-2\n10.1007/s00464-007-9243-7\n10.1002/mabi.201600246\n10.1007/s10029-011-0887-9\n10.1097/SLE.0b013e3182a2f008\n10.1073/pnas.94.5.1852\n10.1007/s00595-014-1056-4\n10.1055/s-0030-1255354"}

In this study, the bending problem of a piezoelectric cantilever beam was investigated via theoretical and experimental methods. First, the governing equations of the problem were established and non-dimensionalized. Three piezoelectric parameters were selected as perturbation parameters and the perturbation solution of the equations was finally obtained using a multi-parameter perturbation method. In addition, the relevant experiments of the piezoelectric cantilever beam were carried out, and the experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical solutions. Based on the experimental results, the effect of piezoelectric properties on the bending deformation of piezoelectric cantilever beams was analyzed and discussed.

The theoretical model presents how to produce the circular streaming (rotation) of the liquid around an infinitely long pillar with micro-sized diameter. The practical application has been focused to make a time-stable circular stream of the medium around the finite long vibrated pillar with diameter of 80 \u00b5m in the presence of disturbances produced by the vibrated plate where the pillar is placed. Only the time-stable circular stream in the water droplet around the pillar produces enough energy to rotate the micro-sized rotor. The rotational speed of the rotor is controlled in both directions from -20 rad/s to +26 rad/s. 3D printed mechanical amplifiers of vibrations, driven by piezoelectric actuators, amplify the amplitude of the piezoelectric actuator up to 20 \u00b5m in the frequency region of 200 to 700 Hz.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-11-28", "authors": ["SuzanaUran", "Bo\u017eidarBratina", "Riko\u0160afari\u010d"], "doi": "10.3390/mi10120809\n10.1088/0960-1317/1/2/001\n10.1109/84.273093\n10.3390/mi5040929\n10.1016/j.microrel.2004.12.017\n10.1109/55.506369\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006834\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.02.009\n10.3390/act5010006\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.04.001\n10.1021/ja310365k\n10.1039/c001211d\n10.1063/1.3600775\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141418\n10.1039/C6LC00443A\n10.3390/mi5030681\n10.1038/micronano.2015.1\n10.1039/C8LC01012A\n10.1007/s10404-008-0349-6\n10.3390/mi9100498\n10.1121/1.1907285"}

A liquid ink -1,6 hexanediol- ejected from a piezoelectric nozzle is instantaneously frozen when touching a cooled substrate. The created mold is then poured with PDMS.

With this approach it is possible to make microchannels on different nature surfaces such as glass, paper, uncross-linked PDMS layer or non planar substrates. The versatility of this method is illustrated by printing channels directly on commercial electrodes and measuring the channel capacitance.

{"title": "A Quantitative Ultrasonic Travel-Time Tomography to Investigate Liquid Elaborations in Industrial Processes.", "abstract": "This work presents an ultrasound tomography imaging system and method for quantitative mapping of the sound speed in liquid masses. It is highly desirable to be able to inspect vessel fluid mass distribution, notably in the chemical and food industrial operations. Optimization of industrial reactors has been crucial to the improvement of industrial processes. There is a great need to investigate how and if tomographic imaging sensors could aid the automatic control of these process tanks. Single-measurement ultrasound techniques and especially spectrometric methods have been a subject of study of industrial applications. Tomographic systems provide key multi-dimensional and spatial information when compared to the well-established single-channel measurement system. Recently, ultrasound tomography has attracted a great deal of interest in a wide spectrum of industrial applications. The system has been designed as 32 piezoelectric ring-array positioned in a 30 cm tank, with an excitation frequency of 40 kHz. Two-dimensional transmission travel-time tomography was developed to reconstruct the fluid mass distributions. Prior experiments are mainly based on inclusions of a few centimetres and on a liquid solution of different concentrations. They have been conducted to test the spatial and quantitative resolution of the ultrasound imaging device. Analysing the reconstructed images, it is possible to provide accurate spatial resolution with low position errors. The system also demonstrated inclusion movement with a temporal resolution of 4 frames per second (fps) in dynamical imaging sense. Sound velocity quantitative imaging was developed for the investigation of ultrasonic propagation in different liquids. This work, for the first time, shows how quantitative sound velocity imaging using transmission mode time of flight data could be used to characterize liquid density distribution of industrial reactors. The results suggest that ultrasound tomography can be used to quantitatively monitor important process parameters.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-11-27", "authors": ["PanagiotisKoulountzios", "TomaszRymarczyk", "ManuchehrSoleimani"], "doi": "10.3390/s19235117\n10.3390/s17051085\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.05.024\n10.1088/0957-0233/7/3/007\n10.1016/S1385-8947(00)00278-3\n10.1063/1.4748520\n10.1088/0957-0233/11/5/310\n10.1021/op400362f\n10.1021/la402478h\n10.1016/j.cherd.2018.01.014\n10.1002/9780470027318.a1518\n10.1021/ie990448c\n10.1016/j.partic.2012.05.010\n10.1016/j.ultras.2004.06.005\n10.1063/1.1697584\n10.1205/026387602321143453\n10.1208/pt060221\n10.3390/s19153400\n10.17531/ein.2019.2.10\n10.5772/29718\n10.1109/TIM.2018.2882119\n10.1016/0167-2789(92)90242-F\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2637411\n10.1118/1.3656063\n10.1080/00401706.1969.10490657\n10.3390/s18114014\n10.1002/pol.1949.120040410"}

The chemical compositions of the resulting membranes were identified using Fourier transform infrared. A lab-scale cross-flow filtration system module was used to evaluate the membrane's hydraulic and separation performance by the filtration of humic acid (HA) solution as the model contaminant.

The drug release profile of the disulfiram-loaded scaffold was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography. We obtained mechanical and morphological characterizations of A549 cells treated with different scaffolds by various techniques to evaluate its antitumor properties. This work revealed that the cells after the treatment with the disulfiram-loaded scaffold exhibited a lower height and a larger elastic modulus compared with the untreated cells and those treated with the neat electrospun fibers.

{"title": "A Microfluidic MEMS-Microbalance Platform With Minimized Acoustic Radiation in Liquid.", "abstract": "In this article, the microfluidic channels that deliver liquid to a microscale thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon (TPoS) gravimetric resonant sensor are incorporated into the backside of the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer on which the resonator is fabricated. Specifically, a microwell is embedded at the bottom of the disk -shaped TPoS resonator, while a very thin layer of parylene covering the backside of the resonator and the microwell forms an isolation layer between the liquid and the top device-layer features. In this way, the liquid is in contact with the backside of the resonator, while the device-defining trenches and the electrical connections to the resonator stay clear, thus mitigating the acoustic energy loss and undesirable feedthroughs. The impact of the parylene layer thickness on a few symmetric ( S ) and antisymmetric ( A ) Lamb wave modes of the resonator is experimentally studied, and the performance of such modes in the liquid is characterized by filling the microwells through a PDMS-based microfluidic channel. The parylene layer, while marginally affecting the resonator in the air, is found to substantially enhance its performance in the liquid media. Strong resonance peaks with high quality factors ( Q ) are observed for the S modes, among which Q values above 400 are recorded for a specific mode named S (4, 2) (among the highest ever reported). This article can potentially facilitate the realization of highly stable and sensitive resonant mass sensors (i.e., microbalance) for real-time applications. Additionally, the effect of the acoustic energy radiation in the form of evanescent shear and longitudinal waves in liquid on the Q and resonance frequency of the disk resonators is experimentally validated.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-11-26", "authors": ["HakhamaneshMansoorzare", "SarahShahraini", "AnkeshTodi", "NilabAzim", "DarinaKhater", "SwaminathanRajaraman", "RezaAbdolvand"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2955402"}

{"title": "A Lithium-Ion Pump Based on Piezoelectric Effect for Improved Rechargeability of Lithium Metal Anode.", "abstract": "Lithium metal is widely studied as the \"crown jewel\" of potential anode materials due to its high specific capacity and low redox potential. Unfortunately, the Li dendrite growth limits its commercialization. Previous research has revealed that the uniform Li-ion flux on electrode surface plays a vital role in achieving homogeneous Li deposition. In this work, a new strategy is developed by introducing a multifunctional Li-ion pump to improve the homogenous distribution of Li ions. Via coating a \u03b2-phase of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (\u03b2-PF) film on Cu foil (Cu@\u03b2-PF), a piezoelectric potential across such film is established near the electrode surface because of its piezoelectric property, which serves as a driving force to regulate the migration of Li ions across the film. As a result, uniform Li-ion distribution is attained, and the Cu@\u03b2-PF shows coulombic efficiency around 99% throughout 200 cycles. Meanwhile, the lithium-sulfur full cell paired with Li-Cu@\u03b2-PF anode exhibits excellent performance.

A first systematic investigation of debonding behaviors by considering actuators and sensors simultaneously was performed in this paper. The debonding areas of actuators were set in different percentage range from 0% to 70%, and sensors in 0%, 20%, 40% and 60%. The signal-based monitoring method was used to extract the characteristic parameters of both the amplitudes and phases of received signals. Experimental results revealed that as the debonding areas of the actuators increase, the normalized amplitude appears a quick decrease before 35% debonding area of actuators and then a slow rise until 60% of debonding reached. This may be explained that the 35% debonding turning point correspond to the coincidence of the excitation frequencies of peripheral actuators with the inherent frequency of the central piezoelectric sensor, and the 60% be the result of the maximum ability of piezoelectric sensor. The degrees of debonding of actuators and sensors also have significant influence on the phase angle offset, with large debonding of actuators increases the phase offset sharply.

{"title": "Absorbance and EEM fluorescence of wastewater: Effects of filters, storage conditions, and chlorination.", "abstract": "Aim of this study was to delineate sample handling procedures for accurate fluorescence and UV absorbance measurements of wastewater organic matter. Investigations were performed using different wastewater qualities, including primary, secondary and tertiary wastewater effluents, and a wastewater-impacted surface water. Filtration by 0.7\u202f\u03bcm glass microfiber filter, 0.45\u202f\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, 0.45\u202f\u03bcm cellulose nitrate membrane, and 0.45\u202f\u03bcm polyethersulfone (PES) syringe filter released manufacture impurities in water that affected fluorescence measurements. However, pre-washing of filter by Milli-Q water was able to eliminate these interferences. Different storage conditions were tested, including storage of filtered and unfiltered samples under different temperatures (25\u202f\u00b0C, 4\u202f\u00b0C,\u00a0-20\u202f\u00b0C). According to the obtained results, the best practice of wastewater samples preservation was sample filtration at 0.7/0.45\u202f\u03bcm immediately after collection followed by storage at 4\u202f\u00b0C. However, the time of storage that assured changes of these spectroscopic measurements that do not exceed the 10% of the original value was dependent on water quality and selected wavelengths (i.e., selected fluorescing organic matter component). As a general rule, it is advisable to perform fluorescence and UV absorbance measurements as soon as possible after collection avoiding storage times of filtered water longer than 2 days. Finally, addition of chlorine doses typical for wastewater disinfection mainly affected tryptophan-like components, where changes that exceed the 10% of the fluorescence intensity measured in the unchlorinated sample were observed even at very low doses (\u22651\u202fmg/L). On the contrary, tyrosine-like and humic-like components showed changes <10% at chlorine doses of 0.5-5\u202fmg/L.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2019-11-23", "authors": ["MassimilianoSgroi", "EricaGagliano", "Federico G AVagliasindi", "PaoloRoccaro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125292"}
{"title": "Tunable Water Delivery in Carbon-Coated Fabrics for High-Efficiency Solar Vapor Generation.", "abstract": "Solar vapor generation by localized heating and evaporation has potential to be a viable and \"green\" way to produce fresh water. This work reports a carbon black-coated cotton fabric with a tunable water delivery property for high-efficiency solar vapor generation under 1 sun. The fabric is prepared by an electrospray of poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) on one-side of the fabric followed by dip-coating of the fabric with carbon black as a photothermal absorber. Depending on the duration of electrospray, the roughness gradient generated by the PVDF-HFP layer in the fabric leads to guided and continuous one-way water transport from the electrosprayed hydrophobic side to the hydrophilic side with a tunable delivery rate. The tunable water delivery capability of the fabric regulates the amount of water supplied to the vicinity of the photothermal absorber. Additionally, the fabric shows excellent broadband absorption and low thermal conductivity. In comparison with the carbon black-coated fabric without a roughness gradient, the regulation of water improves the solar vapor conversion efficiency, owing to reduced heat loss and better heat allocation. Under optimal conditions, a solar vapor conversion efficiency of 88.9% and a stable water evaporation rate of 1.33 kg (m", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-11-23", "authors": ["YeranLi", "XinJin", "YideZheng", "WeiLi", "FanZheng", "WenyuWang", "TongLin", "ZhengtaoZhu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b17360"}

This work investigates and isolates the role of both piezoelectricity and the mechanical redistribution of strain on the damping properties of fiber-reinforced composites through the integration of a nanowire interphase between the fiber and matrix. Prior works have successfully studied and reported the effectiveness of modifying the surface of the reinforcing fibers in a composite material using nanowires and other nanostructured interfaces to increase mechanical damping, however, have yet to fully investigate the mechanism dictating the observed behavior. This study analyzes the effects of nonpiezoelectric nanowire interfaces in comparison to piezoelectric nanowire interfaces of the same microscale morphology. The damping properties of carbon fiber-reinforced composites containing both sets of nanowires are investigated via dynamic mechanical analysis over a range of temperatures as well as modal analysis at the first resonant frequency. The results conclusively indicate that a combination of both mechanical and piezoelectric effects contributes to the significant increase in damping properties of fiber-reinforced composites and quantifies the individual contributions.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-11-23", "authors": ["LoriAnneGroo", "KelseySteinke", "Daniel JInman", "Henry ASodano"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b17029"}
{"title": "The phase structure and dielectric properties around a new type of phase boundary in a lead ytterbium niobite based solid solution.", "abstract": "The phase boundaries of dielectric materials have constantly been valuable for instructing the design of phase structures, revealing correlations between compositions and structures, and attaining the desired functional properties for piezoelectric, pyroelectric, electrostriction, electrocaloric, energy storage and energy harvesting applications. We here observe a new type of phase boundary in a solid solution of xPbTiO3\u00b7(1 - x)Pb(Yb1/2Nb1/2)O3 (x = 0.00-0.20), which is between an antiferroelectric (AFE) phase and a relaxor ferroelectric (RFE) phase. x = 0.10 is confirmed as the phase boundary. XRD, TEM, PFM and Raman spectroscopy analysis reveal two fundamental traits of the phase structure: (1) the polar state changes from AFE to FE order; and (2) the domain range evolves from micrometer-sized to nanometer-sized, both of which are normally separated but coexist around the phase boundary. The intriguing phase structure contributes to the distinctive dielectric properties: (1) a broad compositional zone (x < 0.10 and x \u2265 0.14) features low remnant polarization, low hysteresis and highly reversible domain wall motion, and is expected to be utilized for dielectric energy storage and electrostriction applications; and (2) a narrow nonergodic RFE zone (0.10 \u2264 x < 0.14) demonstrates remnant and maximum polarization, co-dominated by composition and temperature, and has potential for pyroelectric and electrocaloric applications.", "journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "date": "2019-11-23", "authors": ["YizhengBao", "XuefengChen", "ShiguangYan", "FeiCao", "XianlinDong", "GenshuiWang"], "doi": "10.1039/c9dt04012a"}
{"title": "Rigid Tightly Packed Amino Acid Crystals as Functional Supramolecular Materials.", "abstract": "The formation of ordered nanostructures by metabolites is gaining increased interest due to the simplicity of the building blocks and their natural occurrence. Specifically, aromatic amino acids possess the ability to form ordered supramolecular interactions due to their limited solubility in aqueous solution. Unexpectedly, l-tyrosine (l-Tyr) is almost 2 orders of magnitude less soluble in water compared to l-phenylalanine (l-Phe). However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood as l-Tyr is more polar. Here, we explore the utilization of insoluble tyrosine assemblies for technological applications and their molecular basis by manipulating the basic building blocks of tightly packed dimers. We show that the addition of an amyloid inhibition agent increases l-Tyr solubility due to the disruption of the dimer formation. The molecular organization grants the l-Tyr crystal higher thermal stability and mechanical properties between three amino acids. Additionally, l-Tyr crystals are shown to generate high and stable piezoelectric power outputs under mechanical pressure in a sandwich device. By incorporating the rigid l-Tyr crystals into a soft polymer, a mechano-responsive bending composite was fabricated. Furthermore, the l-Tyr crystalline needles exhibit an active photowaveguiding property, making them promising candidates for the generation of photonic biomaterial-based devices.

{"title": "Amphipathic molecules modulate PIEZO1 activity.", "abstract": "PIEZO proteins are large eukaryotic mechanically-gated channels that function as homotrimers. The basic PIEZO1 structure has been elucidated by CryoEM and it assembles into a protein-lipid dome. A curved lipid region allows for the transition to the lipid bilayer from the dome (footprint). Gating PIEZO1 is mediated by bilayer tension that induces an area change in the lipid dome. The footprint region is thought to be energetically important for changes in lateral tension. Amphipathic molecules can modulate channel function beyond the intrinsic gating properties of PIEZO1. As a result, molecules that modify lipid properties within the lipid-channel complex (footprint and dome) will profoundly affect channel kinetics. In this review, we summarize the effects some amphipathic molecules have on the lipid bilayer and PIEZO1 function. PIEZO1 has three states, closed, open and inactivated and amphipathic molecules influence these transitions. The amphipathic peptide, GsMTx4, inhibits the closed to open transition. While saturated fatty acids also prevent PIEZO1 gating, the effect is mediated by stiffening the lipids, presumably in both the dome and footprint region. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can increase disorder within the lipid-protein complex affecting channel kinetics. PIEZO1 can also form higher-ordered structures that confers new kinetic properties associated with clustered channels. Cholesterol-rich domains house PIEZO1 channels, and depletion of cholesterol causes a breakdown of those domains with changes to channel kinetics and channel diffusion. These examples underscore the complex effects lipophilic molecules can have on the PIEZO1 lipid dome structure and thus on the mechanical response of the cell.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2019-11-23", "authors": ["Charles DCox", "Philip AGottlieb"], "doi": "10.1042/BST20190372"}

{"title": "The Influence of Piezoelectric Transducer Stimulating Sites on the Performance of Implantable Middle Ear Hearing Devices: A Numerical Analysis.", "abstract": "To overcome the inherent deficiencies of hearing aids, implantable middle ear hearing devices (IMEHDs) have emerged as a new treatment for hearing loss. However, clinical results show that the IMEHD performance varies with its transducer's stimulating site. To numerically analyze the influence of the piezoelectric transducer's stimulating sites on its hearing compensation performance, we constructed a human ear finite element model and confirmed its validity. Based on this finite element model, the displacement stimulation, which simulates the piezoelectric transducer's stimulation, was applied to the umbo, the incus long process, the incus body, the stapes, and the round window membrane, respectively. Then, the stimulating site's effect of the piezoelectric transducer was analyzed by comparing the corresponding displacements of the basilar membrane. Besides, the stimulating site's sensitivity to the direction of excitation was also studied. The result of the finite element analysis shows that stimulating the incus body is least efficient for the piezoelectric transducer. Meanwhile, stimulating the round window membrane or the stapes generates a higher basilar membrane displacement than stimulating the eardrum or the incus long process.

Among the many sensory performances, the high sensitivity is an essential requirement for the practical use of flexible sensors. Therefore, numerous research studies are devoted to improving the sensitivity of the flexible pressure sensors. The fiber assemblies are recognized as an ideal substrate for a highly sensitive piezoresistive sensor because its three-dimensional porous structure can be easily compressed and can provide high interconnection possibilities of the conductive component. Moreover, it is expected to achieve high sensitivity by raising the porosity of the fiber assemblies. In this paper, the three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide/polyolefin elastomer (RGO/POE) nanofiber composite aerogels were prepared by chemical reducing the graphene oxide (GO)/POE nanofiber composite aerogels, which were obtained by freeze drying the mixture of the GO aqueous solution and the POE nanofiber suspension. It was found that the volumetric shrinkage of thermoplastic POE nanofibers during the reduction process enhanced the compression mechanical strength of the composite aerogel, while decreasing its sensitivity. Therefore, the composite aerogels with varying POE nanofiber usage were prepared to balance the sensitivity and working pressure range. The results indicated that the composite aerogel with POE nanofiber/RGO proportion of 3:3 was the optimal sample, which exhibits high sensitivity (ca. 223 kPa", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-11-20", "authors": ["WeibingZhong", "HaiqingJiang", "LiyanYang", "AshishYadav", "XinchengDing", "YuanliChen", "MufangLi", "GangSun", "DongWang"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11111883\n10.1021/acsami.7b14048\n10.1021/acsnano.6b08027\n10.1002/adfm.201570145\n10.1039/C4MH00147H\n10.1021/acsami.8b12363\n10.1002/admt.201700237\n10.1117/1.JBO.22.7.077002\n10.1021/acsami.9b02591\n10.1002/smll.201704149\n10.1021/acsami.9b09265\n10.3390/polym11081289\n10.3390/s130811114\n10.1002/app.47928\n10.1039/C7NR00121E\n10.1080/00405000802377342\n10.3390/polym11071120\n10.3390/polym10060575\n10.1038/s41467-017-01324-7\n10.1021/acsami.9b16565\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2013.10.017\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.04.059\n10.1021/cm048063u\n10.1002/adma.201200491\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.090\n10.1007/s00216-016-9684-8\n10.1021/acsami.7b11431\n10.1039/C6NR02678H"}
{"title": "On the piezotronic behaviours of wurtzite core-shell nanowires.", "abstract": "The piezotronic behaviours of wurtzite core-shell nanowires (NWs) are studied in this paper by using a multiscale modelling technique. A difference between piezopotentials obtained from molecular dynamics simulations and finite element calculations indicates that due to the influence of small-scale effects the widely used conventional electromechanical theory is not accurate in describing the piezopotential properties of the present core-shell NWs. Although the residual strains intrinsically existing in core-shell NWs and the structural reconstruction at their surface and interface both account for these small-scale effects, the latter is found to play the dominate role, which makes the material properties of core-shell NWs significantly depend on their geometric size. A novel core-interface-shell-surface model is proposed here to analytically describe the size dependence of the material properties and thus the small-scale effects on the piezopotential of core-shell NWs. Besides possessing a good piezoelectric performance, our density functional theory calculations also show that the core-shell NWs under external loading can retain the semiconducting properties, which confirms the existence of piezotronic effects in them. However, owing to the intrinsic asymmetric Schottky barriers at the source and drain contacts induced by residual piezopotentials in core-shell NWs, the piezotronic effects of core-shell NWs are different to those of their conventional single-component counterparts. The superb piezopotential properties and unique piezotronic behaviours observed in wurtzite core-shell NWs make them good candidates for high performance components in novel piezotronic nanodevices.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2019-11-19", "authors": ["JinZhang"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ab5881"}

Furthermore, in recent years hBN crystals have become the material of choice for encapsulating other 2D crystals in a variety of technological applications, from optoelectronic and tunneling devices to composites. Monolayer hBN, which has no center of symmetry, is predicted to exhibit piezoelectric properties, yet experimental evidence is lacking. Here, by using electrostatic force microscopy, this effect is observed as a strain-induced change in the local electric field around bubbles and creases, in agreement with theoretical calculations. No piezoelectricity is found in bilayer and bulk hBN, where the center of symmetry is restored. These results add piezoelectricity to the known properties of monolayer hBN, which makes it a desirable candidate for novel electromechanical and stretchable optoelectronic devices, and pave a way to control the local electric field and carrier concentration in van der Waals heterostructures via strain.

{"title": "The Basic Physics of Waves, Soundwaves, and Shockwaves for Erectile Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) has emerged as a treatment modality for erectile dysfunction (ED). To better appreciate the differences between the various devices for the treatment of ED, it is imperative for physicians to understand the underlying physics of the different shockwave generators.\nIn this article, we explain the physics of shockwaves by establishing a foundation regarding the basics of waves, specifically soundwaves. We also describe the different shockwave generators available and assess their potential clinical utility.\nWe reviewed basic principles of wave propagation, randomized controlled trials investigating Li-ESWT for ED and other medical diseases, and individual industry shockwave generator websites, in order to describe the basic physics underlying Li-ESWT.\nWe primarily aimed to describe the physics underlying shockwave generators and to provide a framework for understanding the relevant subtypes and adjustable parameters.\nA wave is a disturbance in a medium that transports energy without permanently transporting matter. In shockwaves, a soundwave is generated with a speed faster than the local speed of sound. Shockwaves are classically generated by three different types of energy sources: electrohydraulic, electromagnetic, or piezoelectric, which all create a shockwave through the conversion of electric potential energy to mechanical energy. Importantly, radial pressure waves do not behave the same as conventional shockwaves and are more like \"ordinary\" sound waves in that they achieve a significantly lower peak pressure, a slower rise time, and propagate outwards without a focal point.\nLi-ESWT is not currently approved by the\u00a0U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is considered investigational in the United States. However, it is currently available to patients under clinical trial protocols and it is important to understand the basic physics of shockwaves to understand the differences between the different shockwave devices.\nThis is a comprehensive review of the physics underlying Li-ESWT but only tangentially explores the biological impact of shockwaves.\nPhysicians currently using or those contemplating purchasing a Li-ESWT device should understand the basic physics underlying the device, as well as which treatment protocols were used to demonstrate clinical efficacy in treating ED.

SAW devices encapsulated with conventional thick organic materials fail to function effectively, while devices with an ultra-thin alumina encapsulation layer (AEL) function normally with high performance. After being subjected to degradation in water, a FB-SAW device with no AEL starts to degrade immediately and fails within 8 h, due to dissolution of the tungsten electrode and piezoelectric material (ZnO). The coating of an ultra-thin AEL on the surfaces prevents SAW devices from undergoing degradation in water and enables SAW devices to perform normally before the AEL is dissolved. The stable operation lifetimes of SAW devices are linearly dependent on the AEL thickness, thus allowing for the design of devices with precisely controlled operational lifetimes and degradation times. The results show that all the materials used could be degraded; also, in vitro cytotoxicity tests indicate that the encapsulated FB-SAW devices are biocompatible, and cells can adhere and proliferate on them normally, demonstrating great potential for broader biodegradable electronic device applications.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-11-16", "authors": ["ShuyiHuang", "WeipengXuan", "ShutingLiu", "XiangTao", "HongshengXu", "ShijieZhan", "JinkaiChen", "ZhenCao", "HaoJin", "ShurongDong", "HangZhou", "XiaozhiWang", "Jong MinKim", "JikuiLuo"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr06566k"}

Novel stable crack initiation method (SCIM) is established to improve the gauge factor (GF) with maximum achievable working strain region for PI tape enabled buckypaper hybrid sensors. Cracks are generated by applying strain rate-controlled tension force using dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). The sensor has been cycled in tension to characterize GF with crack opening. It is determined experimentally that GF increases with increasing crack opening and crack becomes unstable when opening increases above 8\u2009\u00b5m. Tremendous improvement in GF has been observed which improved from single-digit to several hundreds. The highest GF obtained so far is ~255, showing 75 times improvement compared with the ones without the SCIM implementation. The crack initiation strain (CIS) is characterized by sonication and centrifugation time. It is determined experimentally that the maximum CIS of 3.5% can be achieved with sonication time of 40\u2009min and increasing centrifuge time has an in-significantly dropping effect on CIS.

{"title": "Kinetic Energy Harvesting for Wearable Medical Sensors.", "abstract": "The process of collecting low-level kinetic energy, which is present in all moving systems, by using energy harvesting principles, is of particular interest in wearable technology, especially in ultra-low power devices for medical applications. In fact, the replacement of batteries with innovative piezoelectric energy harvesting devices can result in mass and size reduction, favoring the miniaturization of wearable devices, as well as drastically increasing their autonomy. The aim of this work is to assess the power requirements of wearable sensors for medical applications, and address the intrinsic problem of piezoelectric kinetic energy harvesting devices that can be used to power them; namely, the narrow area of optimal operation around the eigenfrequencies of a specific device. This is achieved by using complex numerical models comprising modal, harmonic and transient analyses.

To elucidate its functioning in sound transmission, we studied the vibration response of 32 pairs of formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde-fixed TPCs of Globicephala macrorhynchus, the short-finned pilot whale (legally obtained in Taiji, Japan). A piezoelectric-crystal-based vibrator was surgically attached to a location on the cochlea near the exit of the acoustic nerve. The crystal delivered vibrational pulses through continuous sweeps from 5 to 50\u202fkHz. The vibration response was measured as a function of frequency by Laser Doppler Vibrometry at five points on the TPC. The aim of the experiment was to clarify how the vibration amplitudes produced by different frequencies are distributed on the TPC. At the lowest frequencies (<12\u202fkHz), no clear differential pattern emerged. At higher frequencies the anterolateral lip of the TP responded most sensitively with the highest displacement amplitudes, and response amplitudes decreased in orderly fashion towards the posterior part of the TPC. We propose that this works as a lever: high-frequency sounds are most sensitively received and cause the largest vibration amplitudes at the anterior part of the TP, driving movements with lower amplitude but greater force near the posteriorly located contact to the ossicular chain, which transmits the movements into the inner ear. Although force (pressure) amplification is not needed for impedance matching in water, it may be useful for driving the stiffly connected ossicles at the high frequencies used in echolocation.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2019-11-15", "authors": ["ItamarTsur", "NirShaviv", "IsraelBronstein", "DavidElmakis", "OshriKnafo", "Yehudah LWerner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.heares.2019.107810"}

Reference materials are essential for calibration and quality control processes, and for verification of the accuracy and reliability of the analytical results obtained. Owing to the complexity of their manufacture, reference materials for chemical agents occurring at workplaces are expensive and available only on a limited scale and for a small number of substances. Therefore, their cost-effective and fast production is an important aim. The Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (IFA) of the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV) currently pursues different strategies for the production of reference materials. One strategy entails the use of a piezoelectric micro-dispensing system for non-contact spiking of extremely small quantities of substances with high reproducibility. The dispensing system is coupled to a semi-automated assembly unit for loading high numbers of samples. It is used for spiking phosphoric and sulphuric acid onto quartz fibre filters. Comparison of the results obtained on different days shows higher variability than results observed on the same day. However, after daily adjustment of the number of droplets to the current droplet volume, highly reproducible series with an adequate number of samples (>500) could be realized. The results of the internal quality control were verified in an interlaboratory comparison. Furthermore, storage stability was investigated systematically over a period of 2 years.

Furthermore, the assemblies display high piezoelectric properties, with a measured open-circuit voltage of up to 1.4 V.

This new computer-controlled laboratory instrument is able to obtain the active electrical model of the piezoelectric materials and the generalized linear equivalent electrical model of the energy storage and harvesting circuits in an accurate and automatized empirical process.

The methodology presented allows the use of only two load resistor values to empirically verify the value of the output impedance of the harvester previously determined by simulations. This parameter is unknown a priori and is very relevant for optimizing the energy harvesting process based on maximum power point algorithms. The relative error achieved between the theoretical analysis by applying the models and the practical tests with real harvesting systems is under 3%.

In order to study the gallic acid diffusion, in vitro experiments were performed using Franz cells associated to different membranes. As first approach the gallic acid diffusion was evaluated through synthetic membranes, such as cellulose, nylon, polycarbonate, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride and the commercial Strat-M\u00ae membrane. The membranes were employed separately or in association and compared to stratum corneum epidermis membranes, in order to find a system able to reproduce the gallic acid diffusion through the skin. Selected membranes were used for studying gallic acid diffusion from poloxamer gel. It was found that the diffusion of gallic acid was dramatically influenced by the type of membrane, both in the case of the aqueous solution or poloxamer gel.

Fe-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) are good materials for catalytic degradation of TCE but still face severe challenges including easy fouling, agglomeration, deactivation and difficult separation and reuse etc. To overcome these drawbacks, we have constructed a novel structured PVDF/Fe-Pd NPs composite membrane with nanosized surface pores to execute the TCE degradation. Results indicate the degradation shows pseudo first-order reaction kinetics and high degradation rate in the static state degradation. Furthermore, the degradation ability can be enhanced by increasing Fe and Pd contents, the degradation temperature or decreasing the degradation pH value. However, the degradation is essentially limited by the diffusion. Thus, the cross-flow degradation is further applied to promote the diffusion. By this operating model, the degradation ability of the composite membrane can be greatly improved. More importantly, the reactants always keep the purity in the membrane surface side and can be controlled to enter the membrane pore for catalytic degradation. Thus, products can be timely discharged via the membrane pores and the side reactions between reactants and products can be largely reduced. In addition, the nanosized surface pores can also prevent the Fe-Pd NPs from being fouled. In a word, the novel composite membrane shows strong degradation ability, good stability and convenient operating ability for the TEC catalytic degradation.", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "date": "2019-11-13", "authors": ["XiaoluHou", "XiChen", "ShiyinBi", "KunLi", "ChenghaoZhang", "JianzuWang", "WangqingZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135030"}

We investigated whether mechanical vibration could reduce tremor in ET by selectively recruiting afferent pathways. We used piezoelectric actuators to deliver vibratory stimuli to the hand and forearm during long trials (4\u2009min), while we monitored the tremor using inertial sensors. We analyzed the effect of four stimulation strategies, including different constant and variable vibration frequencies, in 18 ET patients. Although there was not a clear homogeneous response to vibration across patients and strategies, in most cases (50-72%) mechanical vibration was associated with an increase in the amplitude of their tremor. In contrast, the tremor was reduced in 5-22% of the patients, depending on the strategy. However, these results are hard to interpret given the intrinsic variability of the tremor: during equally long trials without vibration, the tremor changed significantly in 67% of the patients (increased in 45%; decreased in 22%). We conclude that mechanical vibration of the limb does not have a systematic effect on tremor in ET.

{"title": "Membrane ageing in full-scale water treatment plants.", "abstract": "Membrane filtration is a rapidly expanding choice for drinking water treatment. Unfortunately, there is limited data on long-term changes in the membranes' performance as they age. The present research investigated changes in performance factors as well as chemical characteristics for hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membranes that ranged in age from 8 full-scale drinking water treatment plants. Membranes were harvested by plant operators regularly and analyzed using standardized laboratory tests. Approximately half of the membranes were a new PVDF-based chemistry. These were observed to have insignificant changes in performance factors and chemical characteristics since their beginning of operation. However, because these membranes were newer, only data for the first 5 years of operation was available. The other half of the membranes, with an older PVDF-based chemistry, were observed to have stable behaviour until approximately 5 years of operation; after this time, performance factors and chemical characteristics of the membranes began to change significantly. For these membranes, the clean water resistance and fouling rate increased after 5 years of operation. The mechanical properties of these membranes also deteriorated after 5 years of operation, suggesting that their susceptibility to breach is higher after prolonged use. These changes in performance factors paralleled, and were possibly caused by, the removal of hydrophilic additives from the membrane material. Clean water resistance was identified as a good benchmark for all the parameters studied, a finding that is useful for water treatment facilities in quickly assessing the status of their membranes. Finally, although cumulative exposure dose (C*t) was not used as a metric of membrane age, we observed that when higher doses of hypochlorite were applied, all metrics changed faster than expected based only on years of operation. Therefore, limiting the magnitude of the cumulative hypochlorite dose is essential in managing membrane deterioration.

However, most heart-on-a-chips are not developed for online and continuous monitoring of contractile behavior, which are the main functional characteristics of cardiac tissue. In this study, we designed and investigated on a heart-on-a-chip platform that provides online monitoring of contractile behavior of a 3D cardiac tissue construct. The contractile behavior include contraction force, frequency, and synchronization. They can be evaluated by an image processing system and a piezoelectric sensing system simultaneously. Based on the deformation of a micro-pillar array embedded within the 3D cardiac tissue upon subjected to cardiac contraction, the image processing system provides in situ multi-site detection of the contractile behavior. At the same time, the piezoelectric sensing system measures the contractile behavior of the entire cardiac tissue construct. A 3D cardiac tissue construct was successfully fabricated. Then the heart-on-a-chip platform was validated by applying various motion patterns on the micro-pillars, which mimicked the contraction patterns of the 3D cardiac tissue. The drug reactivity of the 3D cardiac tissue construct after a treatment of isoproterenol and doxorubicin was evaluated by measuring the contractile behavior via the image processing and the piezoelectric sensing systems.

The present theory includes a parabolic distribution of transverse shear strain through the thickness and satisfies zero traction boundary conditions at both free surfaces of the plates. Thus, no shear correction factor is required. The distribution of carbon nanotubes across the thickness of each FG-CNT layer can be functionally graded or uniformly distributed. Additionally, the electric potential in piezoelectric layers is assumed to be quadratically distributed across the thickness. Equations of motion for PFG-CNTRC rectangular plates are derived using both Maxwell's equation and Hamilton's principle. Using the Navier technique, natural frequencies of the simply supported hybrid plate with closed circuit and open circuit of electrical boundary conditions are calculated. New parametric studies regarding the effect of the volume fraction, the CNTs distribution, the number of layers, CNT fiber orientation and thickness of the piezoelectric layer on the free vibration response of hybrid plates are performed.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-11-11", "authors": ["TranHuu Quoc", "TranMinh Tu", "VuVan Tham"], "doi": "10.3390/ma12223675\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.04.026\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.07.002\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2011.11.010\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.08.081\n10.1177/0021998316685165\n10.1016/j.apm.2014.12.058\n10.1016/j.ast.2017.05.032\n10.1016/j.matdes.2010.01.048\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2011.03.005\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.10.135\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.10.089\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.02.003\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.08.018\n10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2013.10.011\n10.1016/j.cma.2018.02.022\n10.1016/j.camwa.2016.09.007\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2014.01.040\n10.1016/j.cma.2017.12.010\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.11.011\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.09.031\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.09.044\n10.2514/3.7490\n10.1115/1.3424154\n10.1016/0045-7825(82)90043-3\n10.1115/1.3167569\n10.1016/0020-7683(84)90056-8\n10.1006/jsvi.1994.1083\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.03.030\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2011.01.004\n10.1016/j.apm.2012.08.008\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.08.025\n10.4208/aamm.11-m11176\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/9/094017\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.10.040\n10.1016/0022-460X(70)90089-1"}

One example is the use of these devices as transducers between otherwise disparate quantum systems. In this regard, a promising approach is to build integrated piezoelectric optomechanical devices that are then coupled to microwave circuits. Optical absorption, low quality factors, and other challenges have up to now prevented operation in the quantum regime, however. Here, we design and characterize such a piezoelectric optomechanical device fabricated from gallium phosphide in which a 2.9\u00a0GHz mechanical mode is coupled to a high quality factor optical resonator in the telecom band. The large electronic band gap and the resulting low optical absorption of this new material, on par with devices fabricated from silicon, allows us to demonstrate quantum behavior of the structure.

These include biocompatible fiber-based devices as smart scaffolds, biosensors, energy harvesters, and nanogenerators for the human body. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current studies focused on the fabrication of ultrafine polymeric and ceramic piezoelectric fibers specifically designed for, or with the potential to be translated toward, biomedical applications. It provides an applicative and technical overview of the biocompatible piezoelectric fibers, with actual and potential applications, an understanding of the electrospinning process, and the properties of nanostructured fibrous materials, including the available modeling approaches.

Herein, we propose a recirculating piezo-driven micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)-based inkjet printhead that has a pressure chamber, a nozzle, and double restrictors. The design and characteristic analysis are performed using a two-port lumped element model (LEM) to investigate the effect of design parameters on the system responses. Using LEM, the jetting pressure at the pressure chamber, velocity at the nozzle inlet, meniscus pressure, and Helmholtz resonance frequency are predicted and the comparative analysis of the jetting pressure and velocity between LEM and the finite element method (FEM) simulation is conducted to validate our proposed LEM method. Furthermore, the effect of a change in major design parameters on the jetting pressure, velocity, and Helmholtz resonance frequency is analyzed. On the basis of this analysis, the optimized device dimensions are finalized. From our analysis, it is also concluded that the restrictor is more sensitive than the pressure chamber in terms of their variations in depth.

By contrast, in relaxor systems, such an MPB does not exist because relaxors of different compositions possess the same macroscopic symmetry. Here, we report the existence of a morphotropic relaxor boundary (MRB) in the single phase relaxor region of a K_{0.5}Na_{0.5}NbO_{3}-xBaTiO_{3} system, which is a composition-induced boundary between two relaxors with different local polar symmetries (tetragonal versus rhombohedral) but with the same macroscopic cubic symmetry.

The nearly matched lattice constants of GaN and BP are commensurate with each other in their lattice structures. The out-of-plane inversion asymmetry coupled with the large difference in atomic charges between the GaN and BP monolayers induces in the heterobilayer a giant out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient (|d33|max \u2248 40 pm V-1), which is the highest ever reported in 2D materials of a finite thickness. It is much higher than the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient reported earlier in multilayered Janus transition metal dichalcogenide MXY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te) (|d33|max = 10.57 pm V-1). Such a high out-of-plane piezoelectricity found in a BP/GaN heterobilayer can bring about gigantic strain-tunable top gating effects in nanopiezotronic devices based on the same. Moreover, electron mobility (\u223c104 cm2 V-1 s-1) is much higher than that of transition metal dichalcogenides and conventional semiconductors. The origin of low lattice thermal conductivity (\u03baL \u223c 25.25 W m-1 K-1) in BP/GaN at room temperature, which is lower than that of black phosphorene (78 W m-1 K-1), buckled arsenene (61 W m-1 K-1), BCN (90 W m-1 K-1), MoS2 (34.5 W m-1 K-1) and WS2 (32 W m-1 K-1) monolayers, has been systematically investigated via phonon dispersion, lattice thermal conductivity, phonon lifetime and mode Gr\u00fcneisen parameters. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) arising from GaN and BP monolayers respectively result in a type II vdW heterobilayer, which is found to be thermodynamically favorable for photocatalytic water splitting in both acidic and neutral media.

{"title": "Multiple-Step Melting/Irradiation: A Strategy to Fabricate Thermoplastic Polymers with Improved Mechanical Performance.", "abstract": "To fabricate thermoplastic polymers exhibiting improved ductility without the loss of strength, a novel multiple-step melting/irradiation (MUSMI) strategy was developed by taking poly(vinylidene fluoride)/triallyl isocyanate (PVDF/TAIC) as an example, in which alternate melting and irradiation were adopted and repeated for several times. The initial irradiation with a low dose produced some local crosslinked points (not 3-dimensional network). When the specimen was reheated above the melting temperature, they redistributed in the PVDF matrix, which is an efficient way to avoid the high crosslinking density at certain positions and the disappearance of thermoplastic properties. During the subsequent cooling process, the crosslinked domains in the thermoplastic polymer matrix is expected to play double roles in turning crystal structures for enhancing the ductility without reducing strength. On one hand, they can act as heterogeneous nucleation agents, resulting in higher nucleation density and smaller spherulites; on the other hand, the existence of crosslinked structures restricts the lamellar thickening, accounting for the thinner crystal lamellae. Both smaller spherulites and thinner lamellae contribute to better ductility. At the same time, these local crosslinked points enhance the connectivity of crystal structures (including lamellae and spherulites), which is beneficial to the improvement of strength. Based on the influence of local crosslinked points on the ductility and strength, thermoplastic PVDF with much higher elongation at break and comparable yielding stress (relative to the reference specimen upon strong irradiation only once) was prepared via MUSMI successfully.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-11-07", "authors": ["JingxinZhao", "JiayaoWang", "XiaojunDing", "YuGu", "YongjinLi", "JingyeLi", "JichunYou"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11111812\n10.1038/nmat3115\n10.3390/polym11060948\n10.1080/15583720701834216\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2018.02.002\n10.1038/nature17981\n10.1038/ncomms4580\n10.1002/pi.5818\n10.1007/s10570-019-02546-2\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.110923\n10.3390/polym11061055\n10.3390/polym11091529\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.04.045\n10.1021/ma001972u\n10.1016/j.tca.2019.02.006\n10.3390/polym11081330\n10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2017.12.040\n10.1002/app.47727\n10.1016/j.polymer.2014.05.019\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00532-5\n10.1002/polb.1987.090250402\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2018.08.029\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.08.116\n10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00539\n10.1002/pol.1980.180180615\n10.1021/acs.iecr.7b03387\n10.1016/j.proche.2016.03.084\n10.1002/pol.1982.170200712\n10.1016/j.polymer.2017.05.011\n10.1021/ma60048a040\n10.15669/pnst.2.160\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2017.11.028\n10.1021/ma401326g\n10.1002/adfm.201001682\n10.1002/app.30341\n10.1016/j.polymer.2018.02.004\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.04.034\n10.1021/jp304166t\n10.1002/app.48154"}
{"title": "The Origin and Evolution of the HARMONIC\u00ae Scalpel.", "abstract": "When Jacques and Pierre Curie first researched ultrasonic energy and piezoelectric effects in the 1880s, they likely had no idea of the profound impact it would eventually have on surgical patients. Today in operating rooms around the world, ultrasonic energy is used for tissue manipulation, dissection, cutting, and coagulation. Surgeons including but not limited to the specialties of gynecology, general surgery, colorectal, thoracic, breast, and bariatric have activated ultrasonic energy in thousands of patients. As a mainstay surgical energy device, patients have benefited from the ultrasonic versatility of its cutting and coagulating effects. The ability of ultrasonic energy to be used near vital organs with precision by adjusting for tissue tension, power settings, and activation time has accounted for its safety and clinical outcomes. This overview of the mechanics of ultrasonic energy and the evolution of the HARMONIC\u00ae (UltraCision, Providence, Rhode Island, now owned by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio) surgical tools since 1988 provides readers an understanding of this energy platform and its distinct advantages.

{"title": "A Phase-Canceled Backing Layer for Ultrasound Linear Array Transducer: Modeling and Experimental Verification.", "abstract": "In this study, a phase-canceled backing layer for ultrasound linear array transducer is presented. The proposed backing layer is composed of multiple blocks operated by a phase inversion technique. Inside the proposed backing layer, the phase of the reflected signals can be canceled by adjusting acoustic impedance, piezoelectric layer contact area, and thickness of each block constituting the backing layer. Therefore, the total thickness of the backing layer can be significantly reduced while maintaining the performance. Using finite element analysis (FEA) simulation, its performance was verified based on an 8-MHz linear array transducer. Two types of bulk-type backing layers with different thicknesses were also simulated to compare the performance of the proposed method. In the case of a narrow bandwidth signal without the matching layers, the 10-mm-thick bulk-type backing layer yielded a -6-dB bandwidth of 37.2%. When its thickness was reduced to 2 mm, the -6-dB bandwidth was decreased to 17.3% due to the reflected back-wall signals. However, the -6-dB bandwidth of the proposed backing layer with 2-mm thickness was 39.5%, which is similar to the thick bulk-type backing layer. In the case of broad bandwidth signal with the matching layers, the proposed transducer also exhibits similar performance compared with the thick bulk-type backing layer. The narrow bandwidth signal was experimentally implemented by using a prototype array transducer with the proposed technique, and the performance was similar to the simulation. Thus, the proposed method can reduce the thickness of the backing layer of various array transducers.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-11-07", "authors": ["Da SolKwon", "Jin HoSung", "Chan YukPark", "Eun YoungJeong", "Jong SeobJeong"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2950928"}

{"title": "Reliability of Protective Coatings for Flexible Piezoelectric Transducers in Aqueous Environments.", "abstract": "Electronic devices used for marine applications suffer from several issues that can compromise their performance. In particular, water absorption and permeation can lead to the corrosion of metal parts or short-circuits. The added mass due to the absorbed water affects the inertia and durability of the devices, especially for flexible and very thin micro-systems. Furthermore, the employment of such delicate devices underwater is unavoidably subjected to the adhesion of microorganisms and formation of biofilms that limit their reliability. Thus, the demand of waterproofing solutions has increased in recent years, focusing on more conformal, flexible and insulating coatings. This work introduces an evaluation of different polymeric coatings (parylene-C, poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS), poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA), and poly-(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)) aimed at increasing the reliability of piezoelectric flexible microdevices used for sensing water motions or for scavenging wave energy. Absorption and corrosion tests showed that Parylene-C, while susceptible to micro-cracking during prolonged oscillating cycles, exhibits the best anti-corrosive behavior. Parylene-C was then treated with oxygen plasma and UV/ozone for modifying the surface morphology in order to evaluate the biofilm formation with different surface conditions. A preliminary characterization through a laser Doppler vibrometer allowed us to detect a reduction in the biofilm mass surface density after 35 days of exposure to seawater.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-11-07", "authors": ["MassimoMariello", "FrancescoGuido", "Vincenzo MarianoMastronardi", "RobertoGiannuzzi", "LucianaAlgieri", "AntonioQualteri", "AlfonsoMaffezzoli", "MassimoDe Vittorio"], "doi": "10.3390/mi10110739\n10.1002/app.1979.070230813\n10.1177/0731684415609139\n10.1016/0010-4361(95)90880-9\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2010.03.012\n10.1149/06926.0009ecst\n10.1016/j.oceaneng.2014.05.003\n10.1016/j.arabjc.2014.03.006\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e01067\n10.1007/s11434-010-4158-4\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19980805)59:3<374::AID-BIT14>3.0.CO;2-E\n10.1098/rsta.2011.0502\n10.1007/s00253-002-1066-9\n10.1021/acsaem.8b00820\n10.1039/C4RA10319J\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.027\n10.3390/s17051080\n10.1021/am900825h\n10.1016/j.desal.2012.07.006\n10.1007/s40722-014-0008-9\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.06.035\n10.1021/ac071903e\n10.1371/journal.pone.0004572\n10.1016/j.proeng.2016.06.525\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.08.029\n10.3390/coatings8050157\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.01.014\n10.1590/S1516-14392013005000140\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.008\n10.1002/adma.200502454\n10.1021/cm010454a\n10.1002/ppap.200600158\n10.1016/j.corsci.2010.09.034\n10.1016/j.msec.2015.03.060\n10.1016/S0257-8972(00)00889-6\n10.1016/j.proeng.2012.06.368\n10.1038/s41467-019-10362-2\n10.1109/JSTQE.2004.824072\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2011.10.002\n10.1016/j.corsci.2017.03.022\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2015.04.003\n10.1016/j.molliq.2016.01.092\n10.1016/j.porgcoat.2017.01.008\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2007.05.016\n10.1016/j.jfluchem.2015.02.004\n10.1016/j.memsci.2014.03.055\n10.1039/C7RA01604B\n10.1021/am502467y\n10.1177/1847980419862075\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2005.02.001\n10.1007/BF00540386\n10.1002/app.1983.070280719\n10.1002/pssb.2220760205\n10.1002/pen.760330204\n10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00677-6\n10.1016/j.corsci.2011.04.018\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.05.040\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.107\n10.1116/1.581544\n10.1021/ie50320a024\n10.1371/journal.pone.0214192"}

The strength of interaction between specific TCR with pMHC is a key defining factor for optimal T cell activation. But a number of studies have also suggested a crucial involvement of mechanical cues within the immunological synapse. However, a dedicated mechanosensor molecule that senses and transduces the mechanical cues to optimize TCR activation was, until very recently, not known. The putative candidates included the TCR itself as well as the integrins within the immunological synapse. Recently, the Piezo family of proteins was discovered as professional mechanosensors implicated in a number of physiological processes. One of the two Piezo family members, Piezo1, is expressed in human T cells. Recent data suggest that Piezo1 functions as a professional mechanotransducer at the immunological synapse during TCR-pMHC interaction, and thus play a crucial role in human T cell activation. Thus, the domain of T cell activation has gathered a new mechanoregulatory dimension, which should incite further studies for detailed elucidation of the mechanistic underpinnings and its translational implications.", "journal": "Critical reviews in immunology", "date": "2019-11-05", "authors": ["Chinky Shiu ChenLiu", "DipyamanGanguly"], "doi": "10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2019029595"}

The prepared photodetectors based on tellurium nanomesh exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility, fast response in a broad range from ultraviolet to near-infrared, and good photosensitivity. We found that the flexible photodetectors with Shottky contact drastically suppressed dark current, while the response speed was lowered in comparison to the devices with ohmic contact, as holes would take a long time to tunnel through the Shottky barrier between metal and p-type Te. Moreover, the photoresponse of flexible Shottky photodetectors can be modulated by piezoelectricity of tellurium, and pronounced photocurrent increase after bending many times. Under external stress, polarization charges could tune Shottky barrier height of the metal/tellurium, resulting in variation of photocurrent.

We propose an improved method to straightforwardly derive the surface energy of the porous membrane from contact angles with the interference effect corrected. A linearized model was established combining the Young-Dupr\u00e9 and Cassie-Baxter equations, from which the surface energy (Lifshitz-van der Waals and Lewis acid/base components) and roughness index (surface area difference) can be solved simultaneously at a given porosity using contact angles measured with a set of standard polar/nonpolar test liquids. The model solution was examined using hydrophilic microfiltration membranes with different pore morphologies (including perforated plate-like PCTE, irregular particulate bed-like PVDF, and fibrous mesh-like PTFE membranes), with the robustness of the results evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation. In comparison with the verified results of the model solution, it was found that the Lifshitz-van der Waals Lewis acid/base energy values for the tested membranes would deviate by 50-87, 30-160, and 52-97%, respectively, if surface roughness and porosity were neglected in the calculation. The profound effect of roughness and porosity on surface energy determination was further confirmed via theoretical analysis of the Young-Dupr\u00e9 and Cassie-Baxter relationships. This improved approach may apply to the surface energy characterization of hydrophilic rough porous membranes (e.g., hydrophilic microfiltration membranes).", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2019-11-02", "authors": ["BingjunHan", "XiaomaoWang", "JianzhongZheng", "ShuaiLiang", "KangXiao", "JinlanYu", "ZhiQian", "XiaHuang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b02508"}

PVDF 6010 is a relatively more ductile material, whereas PVDF-HFP (hexafluropropylene) shows larger maximum strain near 300% strain for composites with CNT, 10 times higher than the pristine polymer.

The mechanism, which is intended for water pipes with diameters of 2-5 inches, contains a piezoelectric beam assembled to the oscillating body. A novel U-shaped geometry of an underwater energy harvester has been designed and implemented. Then, the results have been compared with the traditional circular cylinder shape. At first, a numerical study has been carried at Reynolds numbers Re = 3000, 6000, 9000, and 12,000 in order to capture as much as kinetic energy from the water flow. Consequently, unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)-based simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamic forces under different conditions. In addition, an Adaptive Differential Evolution (JADE) multivariable optimization algorithm has been implemented for the optimal design of the harvester and the maximization of the power extracted from it.

{"title": "The Influence of Air Pressure on the Dynamics of Flexural Ultrasonic Transducers.", "abstract": "The flexural ultrasonic transducer comprises a piezoelectric ceramic disc bonded to a membrane. The vibrations of the piezoelectric ceramic disc induce flexural modes in the membrane, producing ultrasound waves. The transducer is principally utilized for proximity or flow measurement, designed for operation at atmospheric pressure conditions. However, there is rapidly growing industrial demand for the flexural ultrasonic transducer in applications including water metering or in petrochemical plants where the pressure levels of the gas or liquid environment can approach 100 bar. In this study, characterization methods including electrical impedance analysis and pitch-catch ultrasound measurement are employed to demonstrate the dynamic performance of flexural ultrasonic transducers in air at elevated pressures approaching 100 bar.

The results highlight the importance of controlling the parameters of the measurement environment and show that although the conventional design of flexural ultrasonic transducer can exhibit functionality towards 100 bar, its dynamic performance is unsuitable for accurate ultrasound measurement.

In this work, Janus SnSSe monolayer is predicted by means of first-principles calculations, and it exhibits dynamic and mechanical stability. By using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Janus SnSSe monolayer is found to be an indirect band-gap semiconductor, whose gap can easily be tuned by strain. High carrier mobilities are obtained for SnSSe monolayer, and the hole mobility is higher than the electron mobility. For SnSSe monolayer, a uniaxial strain in the basal plane can induce both strong in-plane and much weaker out-of-plane piezoelectric polarizations, which reveals the potential as a piezoelectric two-dimensional (2D) material. High absorption coefficients in the visible light region are observed, suggesting a potential photocatalytic application. Calculated results show that SnSSe monolayer has a very high power factor, making it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications.

{"title": "Direct contact ultrasound for fouling control and flux enhancement in air-gap membrane distillation.", "abstract": "Air Gap Membrane distillation (AGMD) is a thermally driven separation process capable of treating challenging water types, but its low productivity is a major drawback. Membrane fouling is a common problem in many membrane treatment systems, which exacerbates AGMD's low overall productivity. In this study, we investigated the direct application of low-power ultrasound (8-23\u202fW), as an in-line cleaning and performance boosting technique for AGMD. Two different highly saline feedwaters, namely natural groundwater (3970\u202f\u03bcS/cm) and RO reject stream water (12760\u202f\u03bcS/cm) were treated using Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Theoretical calculations and experimental investigations are presented, showing that the applied ultrasonic power range only produced acoustic streaming effects that enhanced cleaning and mass transfer. Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR) analysis showed that ultrasound was capable of effectively removing silica and calcium scaling. Ultrasound application on a fouled membrane resulted in a 100% increase in the permeate flux. Cleaning effects accounted for around 30-50% of this increase and the remainder was attributed to mass transfer improvements. Contaminant rejection percentages were consistently high for all treatments (>99%), indicating that ultrasound did not deteriorate the membrane structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of the membrane surface was used to confirm this observation. The images of the membrane surface demonstrated that ultrasound successfully cleaned the previously fouled membrane, with no signs of structural damage.

The aim of this prospective clinical study was to analyze the outcomes using an ultrasonic bone scalpel versus a piezoelectric surgical device and the conventional technique in a Le Fort I osteotomy.\nWe designed a prospective, randomized, single-blind cohort study. The predictor variables were the devices used to perform the Le Fort I osteotomy, divided into 3 groups: 1) ultrasonic bone scalpel (BoneScalpel; Misonix, Farmingdale, NY), 2) piezoelectric surgical device, and 3) conventional technique (Lindeman burr and reciprocal saw). The primary outcome of the study was cutting time, whereas secondary outcomes were length of the procedure, total blood loss, intraoperative complications, and postoperative edema. Other variables of interest were age and gender. Data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nThe study sample was composed of 34 patients with a mean age of 21.5\u00a0years, and 63.3% of patients were women. The mean cutting time (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and length of the procedure (P\u00a0=\u00a0.012) were significantly shorter with the bone scalpel than with the other types of surgery. The ultrasonic bone scalpel showed a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss of up to 45% compared with the piezoelectric surgical device and the conventional technique (P\u00a0=\u00a0.038).\nThe results of this study suggest that the ultrasonic bone scalpel is an effective ultrasonic bone-cutting instrument in a Le Fort I osteotomy as evidenced by the significant decrease in the cutting time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative edema compared with the other techniques.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2019-11-02", "authors": ["Ahmet EminDemirbas", "SuheybBilge", "SelinCelebi", "N\u00fckhetK\u00fct\u00fck", "AlperAlkan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2019.09.021"}

This implant technique was conceived and applied since 1993 by Dr Luca Dal Carlo, as an evolution of the classical ramus blade implant technique. With this technique, you attain great stability of the blade implant, due to the following difference compared with the classical blade implant technique: the hard and soft tissues lying behind implant abutment are not being destroyed at all. A slot is made on the upper side of the bone ridge, and the blade is inserted into it and pushed backwards, so that the implant is embedded under untouched tissues. Using blade implants specially drawn for this particular surgery, the slot's length turns out to be about half of the implant's length. Piezo bistoury is useful to facilitate surgical proceedings. If we compare the regenerated bone on the mesial part of the implant and the bone that had remained untouched on the distal side, we will see a difference in the tissue density even after a long time.

This technique improves the power conversion efficiency of the active rectifiers in two ways. First by decreasing the propagation delay of the comparators, and second by reusing the consumed power by the active diodes.

{"title": "A MEMS ultrasound stimulation system for modulation of neural circuits with high spatial resolution in vitro.", "abstract": "Neuromodulation by ultrasound has recently received attention due to its noninvasive stimulation capability for treating brain diseases. Although there have been several studies related to ultrasonic neuromodulation, these studies have suffered from poor spatial resolution of the ultrasound and low repeatability with a fixed condition caused by conventional and commercialized ultrasound transducers. In addition, the underlying physics and mechanisms of ultrasonic neuromodulation are still unknown. To determine these mechanisms and accurately modulate neural circuits, researchers must have a precisely controllable ultrasound transducer to conduct experiments at the cellular level. Herein, we introduce a new MEMS ultrasound stimulation system for modulating neurons or brain slices with high spatial resolution. The piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (pMUTs) with small membranes (sub-mm membranes) generate enough power to stimulate neurons and enable precise modulation of neural circuits. We designed the ultrasound transducer as an array structure to enable localized modulation in the target region. In addition, we integrated a cell culture chamber with the system to make it compatible with conventional cell-based experiments, such as in vitro cell cultures and brain slices. In this work, we successfully demonstrated the functionality of the system by showing that the number of responding cells is proportional to the acoustic intensity of the applied ultrasound.

However, in order to achieve high spatial resolution with an axicon lens, it is necessary to adjust the separation, called stand-off (\u03b4), between a conventional transducer and the lens attached to it. Comprehensive ultrasound simulations, using the open-source k-Wave toolbox, were performed for an axicon lens attached to a piezo-disc type transducer with a radius of 14 mm, and a frequency of about 0.5 MHz, that is within the range of optimal frequencies for transcranial transmission. The materials properties were measured, and the lens geometry was modelled. Hydrophone measurements were performed through a human skull phantom. We obtained an initial easygoing design model for the lens angle and optimal stand-off using relatively simple formulas. The skull is not an obstacle for focusing of ultrasound with optimized axicon lenses that achieve an identical resolution to spherical transducers, but with the advantage that the focusing distance is shortened. An adequate stand-off improves the lateral resolution of the acoustic beam by approximately 50%.

Phonoangiograms (PAGs)-mathematical analysis of bruits-increases the objectivity and sensitivity and permits quantification of stenosis location and degree of stenosis (DOS). This work describes a flexible and body-conformal multi-channel sensor and associated signal processing methods for automated DOS characterization of vascular access. The sensor used an array of thin-film PVDF microphones integrated on polyimide to record bruits at multiple sites along a vascular access. Nonlinear signal processing was used to extract spectral features, and cardiac cycle segmentation was used to improve sensitivity. PAG signal processing algorithms to detect stenosis location and severity are also presented. Experimental results using microphone arrays on a vascular access phantom demonstrated that stenotic lesions were detected within 1\u00a0cm of the actual location and graded to three levels (mild, moderate, or severe). Additional PAG features were also used to define a simple binary classifier aimed at patients with failing vascular accesses. The classifier achieved 90% accuracy, 92% specificity, and 91% sensitivity at detecting stenosis greater than 50%. These results suggest that point-of-care screening using microphone arrays can identify at-risk patients using automated signal analysis.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2019-10-22", "authors": ["BinitPanda", "SoumyajitMandal", "Steve J AMajerus"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2948303"}

The system on chip (SoC) implementation significantly reduces the physical footprint and power requirements compared to commercial interfaces, which enables the creation nimble prosthetic limbs. Its small size and reduced battery requirements are ideal for advanced prosthetics that utilize electronic skin to provide their user tactile feedback. The architecture consists of multiple charge-sensitive analog front ends (AFEs) interfaced to a central, 16-bit microcontroller core which is capable of processing the sensory information in real time. Event-driven operation allows the chip to monitor all input channels while consuming minimal energy. A test chip has been fabricated in a 0.13\u00a0 \u03bcm CMOS technology and its functionality demonstrated by interfacing the chip to a prototype electronic skin based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric sensors. Tactile signals from the sensors are measured and processed on-chip to calculate the corresponding charge. This is accomplished by programming the microcontroller with a custom software algorithm, granting the system the flexibility to interface to different types of sensors.

{"title": "Temperature variations in pulp chamber: an in-vitro comparison between ultrasonic and rotating instruments in tooth preparation. Part 1.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze pulpal temperature increase generated by prosthodontic margin repositioning and finishing with ultrasonic and rotating instruments. The temperature changes recorded were also correlated with the residual dentin thickness.\nA sample of 32 human extracted molars was selected. The teeth were endodontically treated and prepared with prosthetic round chamfer preparation. Then, they were inserted in plaster cubes up to the cement-enamel junction, leaving the apical portion pervious for inserting the thermocouple probe. The conventional technique, which involves the use of a high-speed contra-angle handpiece, was compared with an ultrasonic method (Crown Prep, Mectron, Carasco, Italy). For margin repositioning and finishing, two walls were randomly selected for each tooth: one was included in the test group and cut with the piezoelectric instrument (Multipiezo Touch TipHolder DB2, Mectron, Carasco, Genoa, Italy), the other one was inserted in the control group and cut with the high speed contra-angle handpiece (Kavo, Biberach, Germany). To standardize the operator-dependent parameters, it was used a mechanical arm controlled by a computer. These parameters were the pressure exerted on the dental wall, the cutting length and the time required for margin repositioning and finishing. For both test and control group, test phase consisted in a first stage of margin repositioning using an ultrasound tip or a diamond bur with a greater granulometry (120 \u00b5m for the ultrasound tip and 125 \u00b5m for the diamond bur), followed by a second finishing step conducted by an ultrasound tip or a diamond bur with smaller granulometry (60 \u00b5m for the ultrasound tip and 30 \u00b5m for the diamond bur). During these stages the intrapulpal temperature was recorded thanks to a thermocouple. Before and after these steps, the thickness of the remaining dental walls was measured with a caliber.\nThe average pulpal temperature increase was 5.03\u00b10.98 \u00b0C for the ultrasonic preparation (test group) and 3.55\u00b10.95 \u00b0C for the conventional technique (control group). The difference was statistically significant (P value <0.001). However, neither of the instruments reached the critical level of 5.5 \u00b0C reported in the literature. The mean initial dentin thicknesses was 1.82\u00b10.47 mm for the control group and 1.59\u00b10.54 mm for the test group but the analysis of the residual dentin thicknesses revealed a greater reduction of the walls worked up with high speed contra-angle handpiece (mean 0.9\u00b10.5 mm), which was therefore more aggressive than the ultrasonic instrument (mean 1.1\u00b10.5 mm). A very weak negative correlation was present between the thickness of the wall at baseline and the increment of temperature.\nWithin limitations of this study, temperature increasing of ultrasonic instruments shows a statistical difference related to rotary ones. But, as literature shows, the ultrasonic advantages are margin precision, preservation of soft tissues and reduction of operating times. Furthermore, in relation with results of this study, they could be considered safe for pulp vitality because the increase in pulpal temperature is similar to traditional instruments and it does not exceed the critical level of 5.5 \u00b0C.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2019-10-22", "authors": ["DomenicoBaldi", "JacopoColombo", "MassimoRobiony", "MariaMenini", "ElisaBisagni", "PaoloPera"], "doi": "10.23736/S0026-4970.19.04279-1"}

The system included a single piezoelectric disc that was bonded to the surface of the composite for excitation, and an embedded phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG) for sensing. The PS-FBG almost simultaneously measured both quasi-static strain and the ultrasonic guided wave-based signals throughout the cure cycle. A traditional FBG was also used as a base for evaluating the high sensitivity of the PS-FBG sensor. Composite physical properties (degree of cure and glass transition temperature) were correlated to the amplitude and time of arrival of the guided wave-based measurements during the cure cycle. In addition, key state transitions (gelation and vitrification) were identified from the experimental data. The physical properties and state transitions were validated using cure process modeling software (e.g., RAVEN\u00ae). This system demonstrated the capability of using an embedded PS-FBG to sense a wide bandwidth of signals during cure. The distinct advantages of a fiber optic-based system include multiplexing of multiple gratings along a single optical fiber, small size compared to piezoelectric sensors, ability to embed or surface mount, utilization in harsh environments, electrically passive operation, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) immunity. The embedded PS-FBG fiber optic sensor can monitor the entire life-cycle of the composite structure from curing, post-cure/assembly, and in-service creating \"smart structures\".", "journal": "Journal of composite materials", "date": "2019-10-22", "authors": ["Tyler BHudson", "NicolasAuwaijan", "Fuh-GwoYuan"], "doi": "10.1177/0021998318793512"}

Interfacial free energy prediction affirmed the presence of zwitterionic functional layer on membrane surface could substantially decrease the interactions (e.g., electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects) between membrane and foulants, thereby reduced flux decline and high stable flux.

The prototype micro-mechanical device utilized the local stresses produced by the depletion region actuators to generate mechanical vibrations at frequencies far below the resonance frequencies of the structure. A laser Doppler vibrometer was used to measure and compare the displacements and vibration patterns caused by the depletion region and electrostatic actuators. Utilizing depletion region actuators neither requires etching of narrow gaps, which is technically challenging nor is there a need for introducing piezoelectric materials into the fabrication process flow. The simple operating principle and the possibility of exploiting the technique for various optimized linear or nonlinear actuation at small scales provide opportunities for precise electro-mechanical transduction for micro- and nano-mechanical devices. These actuators are therefore suited for the co-fabrication of micro- and nano-mechanical systems and microelectronic circuits. Additionally, the produced strains depend only on the depletion region specifications and the excitation voltage and do not scale with device dimensions. As such, depletion region actuators can be candidates for efficient nanoscale electromechanical actuation.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2019-10-18", "authors": ["MikhailKanygin", "Abbin PerunnilathilJoy", "BehraadBahreyni"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-49988-z\n10.3390/mi7010014\n10.1016/0924-4247(90)85065-C\n10.1109/JSEN.2005.851016\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.883588\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1386679\n10.1109/JMEMS.2003.811726\n10.1109/JMEMS.2006.889503\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.06.014\n10.1109/TED.2011.2105491\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2778307\n10.1109/T-PGUE.1962.29283\n10.1063/1.1702799\n10.1063/1.2920440\n10.1109/TED.2011.2158103\n10.1016/j.simpat.2011.10.008\n10.7567/JJAP.57.107201\n10.1109/TED.2016.2612586\n10.1109/JSEN.2001.936927\n10.1063/1.5093553\n10.7567/JJAP.57.067201\n10.7567/JJAP.57.057201"}
{"title": "Morphological, Electrical, and Chemical Characteristics of Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) Coated PVDF Ultrafiltration Membranes after Plasma Treatment.", "abstract": "A commercial ultrafiltration (UF) membrane (HFM-183 de Koch Membrane Systems) made of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), was recovered with a negatively-charged polyelectrolyte (poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)) (PSS), and the effects on its electric, chemical, and morphological properties were analyzed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), liquid-liquid displacement porometry, Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the modifications induced by the deposition of PSS on the PVDF positively-charged membrane and after its treatment by a radio frequency Ar-plasma. These techniques confirmed a real deposition and posterior compaction of PSS with increasing roughness and decreasing pore sizes. The evolution of the electric resistances of the membranes confirmed crosslinking and compaction with shielding of the sulfonated groups from PSS. In this way, a membrane with a negatively-charged active layer and a pore size which was 60% lower than the original membrane was obtained. The composition of the additive used by manufacturers to modify PVDF to make it positively charged was obtained by different procedures, all of which depended upon the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, leading to fairly consistent results. This polymer, carrying positive charges, contains quaternary nitrogen, as confirmed by XPS. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy confirmed that PVDF changes from mostly the to the \u03b1 phase, which is more stable as a substrate for the deposited PSS.

{"title": "A Frequency Up-Converted Hybrid Energy Harvester Using Transverse Impact-Driven Piezoelectric Bimorph for Human-Limb Motion.", "abstract": "Energy harvesting from human-body-induced motion is mostly challenging due to the low-frequency, high-amplitude nature of the motion, which makes the use of conventional cantilevered spring-mass oscillators unrealizable. Frequency up-conversion by mechanical impact is an effective way to overcome the challenge. However, direct impact on the transducer element (especially, piezoelectric) increases the risk of damaging it and raises questions on the reliability of the energy harvester. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we proposed a transverse mechanical impact driven frequency up-converted hybrid energy harvester for human-limb motion. It utilizes the integration of both piezoelectric and electromagnetic transducers in a given size that allows more energy to be harvested from a single mechanical motion, which, in turn, further improves the power density. While excited by human-limb motion, a freely-movable non-magnetic sphere exerts transverse impact by periodically sliding over a seismic mass attached to a double-clamped piezoelectric bimorph beam. This allows the beam to vibrate at its resonant frequency and generates power by means of the piezoelectric effect. A magnet attached to the beam also takes part in generating power by inducing voltage in a coil adjacent to it. A mathematical model has been developed and experimentally corroborated.

Two types of parameters are simulated with periodic boundary conditions: (1) the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of PMUT, and (2) the electrical impedance and acoustic field of PMUT loaded with air and water. The resonant frequencies and mode shapes of an electrically connected PMUT array are obtained with a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The first resonant frequency difference between 3D FEM simulation and the measurement for a 16-MHz PMUT is reasonably within 6%, which is just one-third of that between the analytical method and the measurement. The electrical impedance of the PMUT array measured in air and water is consistent with the simulation results.

{"title": "Development of a Class-C Power Amplifier with Diode Expander Architecture for Point-of-Care Ultrasound Systems.", "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound systems are widely used in ambulances and emergency rooms. However, the excessive heat generated from ultrasound transmitters has an impact on the implementation of piezoelectric transducer elements and on battery consumption, thereby affecting the system's sensitivity and resolution. Non-linear power amplifiers, such as class-C amplifiers, could substitute linear power amplifiers, such as class-A amplifiers, which are currently used in point-of-care ultrasound systems. However, class-C power amplifiers generate less output power, resulting in a reduction of system sensitivity. To overcome this issue, we propose a new diode expander architecture dedicated to power amplifiers to reduce the effects of sinusoidal pulses toward the power supply. Thus, the proposed architecture could increase the input pulse amplitudes applied to the main transistors in the power amplifiers, hence increasing the output voltage of such amplifiers. To verify the proposed concept, pulse-echo responses from an ultrasonic transducer were tested with the developed class-C power amplifier using a resistor divider and the designed diode expander architecture.

Compared with conventional antibiotics, QDs not only possess photoluminescence properties for imaging and photodynamic therapy but also have high structural stability. To enhance their antimicrobial efficiency, QDs usually are functionalized by polymers, including poly(ethylene glycol), polyethyleneimine, and poly-l-lysine. Also, QDs conjugated with polymers, such as poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and polyvinylidene fluoride, are prepared as antimicrobial membranes. The main antimicrobial mechanisms of QDs are associated with inducing free radicals, disrupting cell walls/membranes, and arresting gene expression. The different mechanisms from traditional antibiotics allow QDs to play antimicrobial roles in multi-drug-resistant bacteria and fungi. Since the toxicity of the QDs on animal cells is relatively low, they have broad application in antimicrobial research as an effective alternative of traditional antibiotics.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-10-17", "authors": ["KeerthigaRajendiran", "ZizhenZhao", "De-ShengPei", "AilingFu"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11101670\n10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.187\n10.3390/polym11040616\n10.2174/2211738507666190429113906\n10.3390/polym10030327\n10.1021/acsami.9b02109\n10.3390/polym11040708\n10.1021/nn501640q\n10.1016/j.apmt.2015.10.001\n10.1021/la704075r\n10.1016/j.jcis.2011.06.039\n10.1007/s11051-012-1286-6\n10.1021/es802806n\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.07.003\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.05.012\n10.1166/jnn.2009.1584\n10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.01013.x\n10.1038/s41598-018-27246-y\n10.1038/srep24184\n10.1007/s13204-014-0389-z\n10.3390/ijms20122975\n10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111620\n10.1021/acsami.5b10132\n10.1016/j.pdpdt.2018.08.011\n10.1039/C6TB02446G\n10.1038/srep20142\n10.1039/C7NR07367D\n10.1021/acsami.8b01429\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.03.028\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.05.063\n10.1039/C3NR06433F\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.05.007\n10.1016/j.tiv.2012.06.001\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.01.010\n10.1016/j.nanoso.2017.08.003\n10.1016/j.saa.2014.11.082\n10.1039/c2cc17200c\n10.1016/j.tsf.2013.09.088\n10.1038/nmat4542\n10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b00173\n10.1002/smll.201200591\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.03.071\n10.1016/j.jdent.2018.04.003\n10.3390/polym10111272\n10.1016/j.nano.2010.10.001\n10.1088/2053-1591/aab917\n10.1016/j.saa.2015.01.110\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.110389\n10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.02.022\n10.2147/IJN.S200493\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.08.031\n10.2174/1568026615666150506150109"}

In addition to the selection of an appropriate sensing material, the performance of the tactile sensing system is conditioned by its interface electronic system. On the other hand, due to the need to embed the tactile sensing system into a prosthetic device, strict requirements such as small size and low power consumption are imposed on the system design. This paper presents the experimental assessment and characterization of an interface electronic system for piezoelectric tactile sensors for prosthetic applications. The interface electronic is proposed as part of a wearable system intended to be integrated into an upper limb prosthetic device. The system is based on a low power arm-microcontroller and a DDC232 device. Electrical and electromechanical setups have been implemented to assess the response of the interface electronic with PVDF-based piezoelectric sensors.

{"title": "ZnO Nanostructures and Electrospun ZnO-Polymeric Hybrid Nanomaterials in Biomedical, Health, and Sustainability Applications.", "abstract": "ZnO-based nanomaterials are a subject of increasing interest within current research, because of their multifunctional properties, such as piezoelectricity, semi-conductivity, ultraviolet absorption, optical transparency, and photoluminescence, as well as their low toxicity, biodegradability, low cost, and versatility in achieving diverse shapes. Among the numerous fields of application, the use of nanostructured ZnO is increasingly widespread also in the biomedical and healthcare sectors, thanks to its antiseptic and antibacterial properties, role as a promoter in tissue regeneration, selectivity for specific cell lines, and drug delivery function, as well as its electrochemical and optical properties, which make it a good candidate for biomedical applications. Because of its growing use, understanding the toxicity of ZnO nanomaterials and their interaction with biological systems is crucial for manufacturing relevant engineering materials. In the last few years, ZnO nanostructures were also used to functionalize polymer matrices to produce hybrid composite materials with new properties. Among the numerous manufacturing methods, electrospinning is becoming a mainstream technique for the production of scaffolds and mats made of polymeric and metal-oxide nanofibers. In this review, we focus on toxicological aspects and recent developments in the use of ZnO-based nanomaterials for biomedical, healthcare, and sustainability applications, either alone or loaded inside polymeric matrices to make electrospun composite nanomaterials.

The nanoparticle-nanorod turnability was achieved with the increase in GO additive, which was necessary to control the defect formation. The optimal defect in ZnO/rGO not only increased ZnO/rGO surface and carrier concentration, but also provided the alternative carrier pathway assisted with rGO sheet for electron-hole separation and prolonging carrier recombination. These properties are ideal for photodetection and photocatalytic applications. For photosensing properties, ZnO/rGO shows the improvement of photosensitivity compared with pristine ZnO from 1.51 (ZnO) to 3.94 (ZnO/rGO (20%)). Additionally, applying bending strain on ZnO/rGO enhances its photosensitivity even further, as high as 124% at r = 12.5 mm, due to improved surface area and induced negative piezoelectric charge from piezoelectric effect. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity with methylene blue (MB) was studied. It was observed that the rate of MB degradation was higher in presence of ZnO/rGO than pristine ZnO.

{"title": "An Overview of High Frequency Acoustic Sensors-QCMs, SAWs and FBARs-Chemical and Biochemical Applications.", "abstract": "Acoustic devices have found wide applications in chemical and biosensing fields owing to their high sensitivity, ruggedness, miniaturized design and integration ability with on-field electronic systems. One of the potential advantages of using these devices are their label-free detection mechanism since mass is the fundamental property of any target analyte which is monitored by these devices. Herein, we provide a concise overview of high frequency acoustic transducers such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface acoustic wave (SAW) and film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) to compare their working principles, resonance frequencies, selection of piezoelectric materials for their fabrication, temperature-frequency dependency and operation in the liquid phase. The selected sensor applications of these high frequency acoustic transducers are discussed primarily focusing on the two main sensing domains, i.e., biosensing for working in liquids and gas/vapor phase sensing. Furthermore, the sensor performance of high frequency acoustic transducers in selected cases is compared with well-established analytical tools such as liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatographic (GC) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Finally, a general comparison of these acoustic devices is conducted to discuss their strengths, limitations, and commercial adaptability thus, to select the most suitable transducer for a particular chemical/biochemical sensing domain.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-10-17", "authors": ["AdnanMujahid", "AdeelAfzal", "Franz LDickert"], "doi": "10.3390/s19204395\n10.1088/0957-0233/14/11/002\n10.1016/S0731-7085(98)00129-0\n10.1109/7361.983465\n10.1088/0964-1726/6/6/001\n10.1038/nmat1390\n10.1016/S0925-4005(97)80165-7\n10.1016/0956-5663(95)99230-I\n10.1016/0924-4247(94)00801-9\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.04.006\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.09.003\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.01.005\n10.1042/EBC20150011\n10.1039/c0nr00201a\n10.3390/s7123442\n10.1002/elan.200603855\n10.1021/ac0202278\n10.1002/elan.200900571\n10.1016/j.aca.2015.02.059\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.07.025\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.03.026\n10.1109/22.915466\n10.1016/j.bios.2007.04.011\n10.1007/BF01337937\n10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.772\n10.1007/s002160000396\n10.1016/S0003-2670(00)01104-1\n10.1016/j.aca.2007.09.056\n10.1016/j.cplett.2008.11.039\n10.1039/c1jm11576f\n10.1021/ac201687b\n10.1016/S0956-5663(98)00087-6\n10.1186/s11671-015-0736-3\n10.1021/ac011294p\n10.1016/j.aca.2014.10.010\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.09.007\n10.1016/j.materresbull.2014.07.054\n10.1109/JSEN.2007.905035\n10.1143/JJAP.46.4729\n10.1016/j.talanta.2010.04.065\n10.1016/S0927-7765(97)00067-2\n10.1016/j.bios.2007.09.003\n10.1016/j.bios.2007.11.022\n10.1016/S0956-5663(01)00198-1\n10.1016/j.ab.2005.12.006\n10.1021/ac010642k\n10.1007/s00216-004-2521-5\n10.1007/s00216-011-4927-1\n10.1016/j.bios.2008.02.011\n10.1016/j.snb.2007.07.020\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.10.042\n10.1088/0957-4484/20/6/065501\n10.1016/j.sna.2004.11.032\n10.12693/APhysPolA.121.240\n10.1063/1.1784872\n10.1016/j.snb.2003.12.019\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.04.070\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.10.076\n10.1149/04901.0445ecst\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa654e\n10.1021/acsami.6b13888\n10.3390/chemosensors5010007\n10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.038\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.12.032\n10.1007/s00216-003-2060-5\n10.1002/1521-4095(200110)13:19<1480::AID-ADMA1480>3.0.CO;2-V\n10.3390/s141223419\n10.1016/j.bios.2004.01.028\n10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.07.001\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.01.063\n10.1023/A:1022274419166\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.09.204\n10.1016/j.bios.2006.06.030\n10.1016/S0956-5663(99)00040-8\n10.1021/bm020116i\n10.1081/AL-200056171\n10.1016/j.talanta.2014.07.071\n10.1039/a703137h\n10.1039/AN9911600881\n10.1016/0250-6874(89)80064-2\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.11.103\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.02.012\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2014.12.002\n10.1021/cr00014a006\n10.3390/s8010370\n10.3390/s130912012\n10.3390/s17092057\n10.1112/plms/s1-17.1.4\n10.1109/58.285476\n10.1109/58.585130\n10.1021/ac010859e\n10.1016/j.bios.2005.11.005\n10.1016/j.aca.2010.07.005\n10.1016/j.ultras.2009.12.006\n10.3390/s17122716\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593389\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.067\n10.1063/1.3483245\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.03.129\n10.1039/b204949j\n10.1016/j.snb.2004.07.012\n10.1016/j.sna.2006.12.027\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1665070\n10.1016/j.bios.2009.01.023\n10.1088/0957-4484/14/1/320\n10.1088/0957-4484/23/31/315303\n10.1063/1.2739218\n10.1016/j.talanta.2008.04.028\n10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1588412\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561635\n10.1063/1.2208372\n10.1063/1.2719149\n10.1016/j.surfcoat.2010.08.109\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.09.083\n10.1109/22.915462\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.09.079\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/3/030\n10.1016/0013-4686(85)85005-2\n10.1063/1.1145396\n10.1021/ac00285a062\n10.1021/ac00020a015\n10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04906\n10.7567/JJAPS.27S1.142\n10.1021/ac0504621\n10.1016/0924-4247(93)00660-V\n10.1088/0960-1317/15/10/017\n10.1016/j.diamond.2005.01.002\n10.1016/S0956-5663(01)00220-2\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.10.001\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.04.026\n10.1007/s00216-008-1911-5\n10.1016/j.bios.2008.04.011\n10.1016/j.bios.2013.06.034\n10.1016/j.bios.2015.04.043\n10.1016/j.bios.2018.05.028\n10.1016/S0956-5663(03)00259-8\n10.1016/j.snb.2013.09.064\n10.1049/el.2011.2414\n10.1016/S0925-4005(99)00212-9\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.08.066\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.09.061\n10.1021/ac4025818\n10.1021/ac50045a024\n10.1109/T-UFFC.1987.26929\n10.1016/j.aca.2013.05.005\n10.1016/S0925-4005(98)00097-5\n10.1016/j.jsamd.2018.12.006\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.09.148\n10.1039/C5TC02138C\n10.1039/C5NR00040H\n10.1016/j.snb.2015.03.069\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.08.020\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.12.062\n10.1109/JMEMS.2005.845405\n10.1063/1.2112187\n10.1016/j.snb.2010.07.047\n10.1109/TED.2008.919283\n10.1016/j.msec.2005.09.059\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.07.162\n10.1021/ac061389x\n10.1016/j.snb.2009.06.021\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00426\n10.1021/cr980094j\n10.1021/nl101586s\n10.1016/j.measurement.2018.07.021\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.01.046\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.09.012"}

{"title": "A Miniaturized Low-Intensity Ultrasound Device for Wearable Medical Therapeutic Applications.", "abstract": "Low-intensity ultrasound has drawn increasing attention recently as a non-invasive modality for medical therapeutic applications. Current commercially available low-intensity ultrasound devices are bulky and expensive. In this paper, a battery-powered miniaturized device is proposed to generate low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound. The proposed device consists of a custom Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an off-chip digital control block, and a piezoelectric transducer. The ASIC, which integrates a DC-DC boost converter and a transducer driver, is implemented in TSMC's 0.18\u00a0 \u03bcm BCD Gen2 process. Measurement results show that a maximum output voltage of 14\u00a0V is achieved by the proposed fully-integrated DC-DC boost converter with a battery supply voltage of 3.7\u00a0V. The peak power conversion efficiency is 29% and the output power at the peak power conversion efficiency is 105\u00a0mW. The on-chip transducer driver employs a half-bridge circuit with two n-type devices at the output stage. A high-voltage level shifter with low power consumption and short propagation delay is proposed in this paper for the high-performance operation of the half-bridge transducer driver. The piezoelectric transducer is a customized transducer with a resonance frequency of 1.5\u00a0MHz. At this frequency, the proposed low-intensity ultrasound device is able to generate continuous-wave ultrasound with a therapeutic power intensity of 32 [Formula: see text]. The proposed low-intensity ultrasound device is low-cost, compact, and light-weight, which enables affordable, and wearable applications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2019-10-16", "authors": ["XiaoxueJiang", "Wai TungNg", "JieChen"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2947395"}
{"title": "A Multi-Functional Physiological Hybrid-Sensing E-Skin Integrated Interface for Wearable IoT Applications.", "abstract": "This paper presents a flexible multi-functional physiological sensing system that provides multiple noise-immune readout architectures and hybrid-sensing capability with an analog pre-processing scheme. The proposed multi-functional system is designed to support five physiological detection methodologies of piezo-resistive, pyro-resistive, electro-metric, opto-metric and their hybrid, utilizing an in-house multi-functional e-skin device, in-house flexible electrodes and a LED-photodiode pair. For their functional verification, eight representative physiological detection capabilities were demonstrated using wearable device prototypes. Especially, the hybrid detection method includes an innovative continuous measurement of blood pressure (BP) while most previous wearable devices are not ready for it. Moreover, for effective implementation in the form of the wearable device, post-processing burden of the hybrid method was much reduced by integrating a proposed analog pre-processing scheme, where only simple counting process and calibration remain to estimate the BP. This multi-functional sensor readout circuits and their hybrid-sensing interface are fully integrated into a single readout integrated circuit (ROIC), which is designed to implement three readout paths: two electrometric readout paths and one impedometric readout path. For noise-immune detection of the e-skin sensor, a pseudo-differential front-end with a ripple reduction loop is proposed in the impedometric readout path, and also state-of-the-art body-oriented noise reduction techniques are adopted for the electrometric readout path. The ROIC is fabricated in a CMOS process and in-house e-skin devices and flexible electrodes are also fabricated.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2019-10-16", "authors": ["KwangmukLee", "Hee YoungChae", "KyeonghwanPark", "YoungohLee", "SeungseCho", "HyunhyubKo", "Jae JoonKim"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2946875"}

It places great obstacles to time-lapsed imaging and measurements that need high spatial resolution or long recording time. Existing solutions often require experimental efforts such as the addition of optical markers together with piezoelectric stage-based active feedback configurations. Herein, we propose an all-digital, postrecording image-processing method to remove the lateral drift in a series of time-lapsed SPRM images. The method first calculates the value of lateral drift at subpixel accuracy by combining image cross-correlation analysis and superlocalization strategy. It subsequently reconstructed the drift-free image sequences in a pixel-by-pixel and frame-by-frame manner, according to the linear decomposition and reconstruction principle. This method purely relies on image processing, and it does not require any experimental efforts or hardware. In addition to SPRM, we further demonstrated the applicability of the present method in other types of optical imaging techniques including bright-field transmission microscope and dark-field scattering microscope.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2019-10-16", "authors": ["JiaGao", "XiangWo", "YongjieWang", "MingheLi", "ChunyuanZhou", "WeiWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02804"}

In stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), HP significantly promoted calcium deposition as well as the expression of odontogenic marker genes, PANX3 and DSPP, and WNT related-genes including WNT5b and WNT16, whereas HP inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced primary cilia expression. WNT signaling inhibitor XAV939 and primary cilia inhibitor chloral hydrate blocked the HP-induced calcium deposition. The PIEZO1 activator Yoda1 inhibited cell proliferation but induced ciliogenesis and WNT16 expression. Interestingly, HP and Yoda1 promoted nuclear translocation of RUNX2, whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of PIEZO1 decreased HP-induced nuclear translocation of RUNX2. Taken together, these results suggest that PIEZO1 functions as a mechanotransducer that connects HP signal to the intracellular signalings during odontoblast differentiation.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2019-10-16", "authors": ["AyaMiyazaki", "AsunaSugimoto", "KeigoYoshizaki", "KeitaKawarabayashi", "KokoroIwata", "RikaKurogoushi", "TakamasaKitamura", "KunihiroOtsuka", "TomokazuHasegawa", "YukiAkazawa", "SatoshiFukumoto", "NaozumiIshimaru", "TsutomuIwamoto"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-51381-9\n10.1146/annurev.genet.36.061802.101708\n10.1016/S0925-4773(97)00115-9\n10.1371/journal.pone.0177557\n10.1074/jbc.M303908200\n10.1679/aohc.71.131\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.012\n10.1016/S0925-4773(99)00095-7\n10.1016/j.jdsr.2016.04.001\n10.1177/0022034510363373\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.10.016\n10.1038/srep39654\n10.1038/s41598-017-03145-6\n10.1177/0022034517743431\n10.1007/s00018-016-2369-9\n10.1007/s00467-010-1731-7\n10.1002/ajmg.a.33727\n10.1038/ng.2007.12\n10.1038/nature02061\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.05.030\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.05.020\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00992.x\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1038/s41598-017-18089-0\n10.1038/ncomms2962\n10.1016/j.bone.2011.08.033\n10.1038/s41467-018-04405-3\n10.1242/dev.153528\n10.1074/jbc.M113.458448\n10.1021/jm100249w\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80258-5\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80257-3\n10.1074/jbc.M500608200\n10.1074/jbc.M501900200\n10.1371/journal.pone.0189890\n10.1152/physrev.00037.2011\n10.1016/0026-2862(81)90087-X\n10.1034/j.1399-6576.2002.460802.x\n10.2170/jjphysiol.31.917\n10.1016/j.devcel.2007.07.002\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.027\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.04.035\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.07.009\n10.1038/ncomms7781\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183030\n10.1038/ncomms10366\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.06.018\n10.1186/2046-2530-1-7\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002745\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002718\n10.1038/nm.3654\n10.1073/pnas.1520408112\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.102\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.016\n10.1038/s41598-019-41940-5\n10.1038/srep03545\n10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208577\n10.1002/jcb.22994\n10.1172/JCI59251\n10.1002/term.2086"}

Herein, we designed, synthesized, and characterized shell/core poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/chitosan (CS) nanofibers by combining the electrospinning and recrystallization processes. Upon incorporating a trace amount of PEDOT (1.0\u202fwt%), the resultant PEDOT/CS nanofibers exhibited low interfacial charge transfer impedance, high electrochemical stability, high electrical conductivity (up to 0.1945\u202fS/cm), and ultrasensitive piezoelectric property (output voltage of 22.5\u202fmV by a human hair prodding). With such unique electrical and conductive properties, PEDOT/CS nanofibers were further applied to brain neuroglioma cells (BNCs) to stimulate their adhesion, proliferation, growth, and development under an optimal external electrical stimulation (ES) and a pulse voltage of 400\u202fmV/cm. ES-responsive PEDOT/CS nanofibers indeed promoted BNCs growth and development as indicated by a large number and density of axons.

Although several microbiological and molecular methods have been developed to detect E. coli O157:H7, the difficulty to rapidly detect low levels of the foodborne bacteria persists. Here, the optimization of a filtration technique to concentrate and rapidly detect E. coli O157:H7 was conducted. Using homogenates prepared from freshly cut lettuce and cabbage samples, the E. coli O157:H7 concentration efficiencies of seven membrane filters were compared. Mixed cellulose ester (MCE) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filters demonstrated the highest bacterial recoveries. In addition, the optimal E. coli O157:H7 detachment method from MCE filters after filtration was investigated. Tapping for 80 s was demonstrated to be the most effective method for detaching bacteria from the filters. Further, the possibility of the rapid detection of low levels of E. coli O157:H7 in lettuce and cabbage was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction after bacterial concentration using MCE and PVDF filters. The use of MCE filters enabled the detection of 10\u00b0 CFU/g (5 CFU/g) of E. coli O157:H7 within 2 hr without microbial enrichment culture. Therefore, concentration by filtration can be used for the rapid detection of low levels of foodborne pathogens. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The modified method, which has been verified in this study, has been optimized to reduce the analysis time and to detect very low concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 within 2 hr.

The nonlinear frequency responses for both plano- and contoured-plate resonators of AT-cut quartz were investigated under various voltage drives, circuit resistances, and quality factors.

In semiconductor heterostructures such as GaAs/AlGaAs, SAWs can thus be employed to transfer individual electrons between distant quantum dots. This transfer mechanism makes SAW technologies a promising candidate to convey quantum information through a circuit of quantum logic gates. Here we present two essential building blocks of such a SAW-driven quantum circuit. First, we implement a directional coupler allowing to partition a flying electron arbitrarily into two paths of transportation. Second, we demonstrate a triggered single-electron source enabling synchronisation of the SAW-driven sending process.

During two 15-month periods a single surgeon treated 24 consecutive patients with a conventional cutting technique and a further 24 consecutive patients with a piezoelectric cutter. In both groups the duration of operation was noted, and neurosensory disturbance graded at 12-month follow up. Neurosensory recovery was better in the piezoelectric group than in the conventional group (p=0.01), and the duration of operation nearly identical.

{"title": "Monitoring of Fiber-Reinforced Composite Single-Lap Joint with Electromechanical Impedance of Piezoelectric Transducer.", "abstract": "The single-lap joint of fiber-reinforced composites is a common structure in the field of structure repair, which has excellent mechanical properties. To study and monitor its quasi-static response behavior under external load, two methodologies called effective structural mechanical impedance (ESMI) and reduced-ESMI (R-ESMI) are presented in this article. A two-dimensional electromechanical impedance (EMI) model for a surface-bonded square piezoelectric transducer (PZT) is adopted to extract more sensitive signatures from the measured raw signatures. There are two major advantages of the monitoring scheme based on ESMI and R-ESMI signatures: (1) excellent monitoring results with less signatures to process, (2) the ability to monitor the quasi-static behavior of a single-lap joint with previously ignored susceptance signatures. Combining the extracted ESMI signatures with the index of root-mean-square deviation, the quasi-static behavior of single-lap joints can be effectively quantified. To test the effectiveness of ESMI methodology, verifying experiments were conducted. The experimental results convincingly demonstrated that the presented ESMI and R-ESMI methodologies have good feasibility in monitoring the quasi-static behavior of a fiber-reinforced composite single-lap joint. The proposed method has potential application in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM).", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-10-09", "authors": ["JianjianZhu", "XinlinQing", "QijianLiu", "XiaoLiu", "YishouWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma12193241\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2017.08.005\n10.1080/00218464.2014.987343\n10.1016/j.procir.2016.09.021\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2018.10.010\n10.3390/s19030545\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.11.048\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.07.007\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/3/N03\n10.1016/j.ultras.2015.07.006\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.062\n10.3390/s19153372\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/105014\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2011.05.009\n10.1177/1475921717717312\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.07.025\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2014.11.002\n10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.012\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2017.03.008\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.10.037\n10.1016/j.acme.2013.10.013\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.01.014\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.02.094\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.09.029\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2007)20:1(53)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2007)20:1(63)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(154)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(166)\n10.1117/12.582146\n10.1106/N0J5-6UJ2-WlGV-Q8MC\n10.1115/1.1421056\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.01.035\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.03.033\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.01.053\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2017.03.001\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.03.018\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2019.03.015\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065026\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.019\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.3390/s17122880\n10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2018.11.003\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.110-116.1361"}
{"title": "Extractable impurities from fluoropolymer-based membrane filters - interference in high-throughput, untargeted analysis.", "abstract": "The removal of particles using fluoropolymer-based membrane filters is usually done so to prolong the life span of an analytical column, prevent hardware damage, and reduce signal suppression. Ironically, these membrane filters tend to leach impurities into the samples as the samples are filtered through them. These impurities have the potential to affect the researcher's interpretation in high-throughput, non-targeted analysis. In this study, extractable impurities from different brands of fluoropolymer-based membrane filters present in the filtrate filtered using the said filters were investigated. The results demonstrated that different brand membrane filters and materials tend to elute vastly different numbers of impurities. There were instances whereby the extractable impurities persisted in both the membrane filter and the filtrate despite the filter being pre-conditioned (up to 3 times). Principle component analysis revealed that filtrates at different purge intervals are distant from the unfiltered samples. Pre-conditioning of the PTFE membrane filters could potentially reduce the number of extractable impurities across the tested brands. PVDF filtrates, however, tend to co-cluster with their respective brands, thus suggesting that dissimilarity persists in brands following conditioning. As such, pre-conditioning of the PTFE membrane filters should be encouraged so as to reduce false positive results, while the use of PVDF membrane filters for mass-spectrometry-based untargeted analysis is not advisable as extractable impurities would still persist after 3 rounds of conditioning. Neither the use of different filter brands, nor the use of different filter materials in a sample batch are encouraged as different membrane materials or brands could potentially elute varying impurities.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2019-10-08", "authors": ["Perng YangPuah", "Dexter JiunnHerng Lee", "Ken HingMak", "Hui JunAng", "Hsing-ChangChen", "Pak YanMoh", "Siat YeeFong", "Yee SoonLing"], "doi": "10.1039/c9ra06198c"}

Especially, electrospun metal- oxide-loaded nanofibers have attracted much attention in many fields. However, the single-needle Electrospinning (ES) inhibits the industrial application of these electrospun nanofiber composites. Bubble-Electrospinning (BE) is an effective free surface ES for mass production of nanofiber membranes loaded with metal oxide. Few relevant patents to the topic have been reviewed and introduced.\nThe BE was used to prepare mass production of Cu(Ac)2 /Zn(Ac)2/ PVDF/ PAN Composite Nanofiber Membranes (CNFMs). Then PVDF/PAN CNFMs containing CuO and ZnO nanocrystals were obtained by heat-treatment. Finally, CuO nanosheets and ZnO nanorods were successfully grown on the surface of PVDF/PAN CNFMs using hydrothermal method. In addition, the morphology and crystal structure of CNFMs were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Powder Diffractometer (XRD).\nThe morphology and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by SEM and XRD. The results showed the heat treatment temperature of 150oC and the hydrothermal temperature of 150oC were the optimal process parameters for the fabrication of PVDF/PAN CNFMs loaded with CuO and ZnO nanocrystals, and a higher heat treatment temperature results in higher crystallinity of ZnO and CuO.\nCuO/ZnO/PVDF/PAN CNFMs were successfully prepared by a combination of BE, heattreatment and hydrothermal method.

With the development of small electronic devices, they are changing from the conventional accessory type, which is portable, to the patchable type, which can be attached to a person's apparel or body, and the eatable/implantable type, which can be directly implanted into the human body. In this regard, it is necessary to address various technical issues, such as high-capacity/high-efficiency small-sized battery technology, component miniaturization, low power technology, flexible technology, and smart sensing technology. In addition, there is a demand for self-powered wireless systems in particular devices. A piezoelectric/triboelectric nanogenerator (PENG/TENG) can generate electric energy from small amounts of mechanical energy such as from blood flow and heartbeats in the human body as well as human movement, so it is expected that it will enable the development of self-powered wireless systems. Due to their unique properties, such as flexibility, transparency, mechanical stability, and nontoxicity, 2D materials are optimal materials for the development of implantable and patchable self-powered nanodevices in the human body.

This study aimed to compare the machinability of ZLS and LDGC in diamond grinding in terms of machining forces and energy, debris, surface and edge chipping damage. Grinding experiments in simulation of dental adjustment were conducted using a computer-assisted high-speed dental handpiece and coarse diamond burs. A piezoelectric force dynamometer and a high-speed data acquisition system were used for on-processing monitoring for assessment of grinding forces and energy. Grinding debris and grinding-induced surface and edge chipping damage were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The results show that grinding of ZLS required higher tangential and normal forces and energy than LDGC (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). ZLS was ranked the most difficult to machine among dental glass ceramics based on a machinability index associated with the material mechanical properties. The higher machinability indices of ZLS and LDGC pose a challenge for clinicians to conduct high-efficient material removal for dental adjustment and repair. Both ZLS and LDGC debris were micro fractured particles but the former were smaller than the latter due to the finer microstructure of ZLS. Ground ZLS surfaces contained more irregular microchipping and microfracture in comparison with LDGC surfaces with intergranular fracture or grain dislodgement. Grinding-induced edge chipping damage remained a serious issue for both ZLS and LDGC, which depths ranged approximately 20-100\u202f\u03bcm and significantly increased with the material removal rate (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).

{"title": "Polyvinylidene fluoride-Hyaluronic acid wound dressing comprised of ionic liquids for controlled drug delivery and dual therapeutic behavior.", "abstract": "To improve the efficacy of transdermal drug delivery systems, the physical and chemical properties of drugs need to be optimized to better penetrate into the stratum corneum and to better diffuse into the epidermis and dermis layers. Accordingly, dual-biological function ionic liquids composed of active pharmaceutical ingredients were synthesized, comprising both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, by combining a cation derived from lidocaine and anions derived from hydrophobic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Active pharmaceutical ingredient ionic liquids (API-ILs) were characterized through nuclear magnetic resonance, cytotoxicity assay, and water solubility assay. All properties were compared with those of the original drugs. By converting the analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs into dual-function API-ILs, their water solubility increased up to 470-fold, without affecting their cytotoxic profile. These API-ILs were incorporated into a bilayer wound dressing composed of a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane to act as a drug reservoir and a biocompatible hyaluronic acid (HA) layer. The prepared bilayer wound dressing was characterized in terms of mechanical properties, membrane drug uptake and drug release behavior, and application in transdermal delivery, demonstrating to have desirable mechanical properties and improved release of API-ILs. The assessment of anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of LPS-induced production of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 by macrophages revealed that the prepared membranes containing API-ILs are as effective as those with the original drugs. Cell adhesion of fibroblasts on membrane surfaces and cell viability assay confirmed improved the viability and adhesion of fibroblasts on PVDF/HA membranes. Finally, wound healing assay performed with fibroblasts showed that the bilayer membranes containing dual-function API-ILs are not detrimental to wound healing, while displaying increased and controlled drug delivery and dual therapeutic behavior. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows the preparation and characterization of bilayer wound dressings comprising dual-biological function active pharmaceutical ingredients based on ionic liquids with improved and controlled drug release and dual therapeutic efficiency. By converting analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs into ionic liquids, their water solubility increases up to 470-fold.

Besides mechanical forces, Piezo1 is selectively activated by micromolar concentrations of the small molecule Yoda1 through an unknown mechanism. Here, using a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we identify an allosteric Yoda1 binding pocket located in the putative mechanosensory domain, approximately 40\u2009\u00c5 away from the central pore. Our simulations further indicate that the presence of the agonist correlates with increased tension-induced motions of the Yoda1-bound subunit. Our results suggest a model wherein Yoda1 acts as a molecular wedge, facilitating force-induced conformational changes, effectively lowering the channel's mechanical threshold for activation.

{"title": "Extending and assessing composite electronic structure methods to the solid state.", "abstract": "A hierarchy of simplified Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) methods, and their combinations has been recently proposed for the fast electronic structure computation of large systems. The covered methods are a minimal basis set Hartree-Fock (HF-3c), a small basis set global hybrid functional (PBEh-3c), and its screened exchange variant (HSE-3c), all augmented with semiclassical correction potentials. Here, we extend their applicability to inorganic covalent and ionic solids as well as layered materials. The new methods have been dubbed HFsol-3c, PBEsol0-3c, and HSEsol-3c, respectively, to indicate their parent functional as well as the correction potentials. They have been implemented in the CRYSTAL code to enable routine application for molecular as well as solid materials. We validate the new methods on diverse sets of solid state benchmarks that cover more than 90 solids ranging from covalent, ionic, semi-ionic, layered, and molecular crystals. While we focus on structural and energetic properties, we also test bandgaps, vibrational frequencies, elastic constants, and dielectric and piezoelectric tensors. HSEsol-3c appears to be most promising with mean absolute error for cohesive energies and unit cell volumes of molecular crystals of 1.5 kcal/mol and 2.8%, respectively.

However, the availability of noninvasive approaches to assess congestion is limited. Noninvasive venous waveform analysis (NIVA) uses a unique physiologic signal, the morphology of the venous waveform, to assess intracardiac filling pressures. This study is a proof of concept analysis of the correlation between NIVA value and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and the ability of the NIVA value to predict PCWP > 18 mmHg in subjects undergoing elective right heart catheterization (RHC). PCWP was also compared across common clinical correlates of congestion.\nA prototype NIVA device, which consists of a piezoelectric sensor placed over the skin on the volar aspect of the wrist, connected to a data-capture control box, was used to collect venous waveforms in 96 patients during RHC. PCWP was collected at end-expiration by an experienced cardiologist. The venous waveform signal was transformed to the frequency domain (Fourier transform), where a ratiometric algorithm of the frequencies of the pulse rate and its harmonics was used to derive a NIVA value. NIVA values were successfully captured in 83 of 96 enrolled patients. PCWP ranged from 4-40 mmHg with a median of 13 mmHg. NIVA values demonstrated a linear correlation with PCWP (r\u202f=\u202f0.69, P < 0.05).\nThis observational proof-of-concept study using a prototype NIVA device demonstrates a moderate correlation between NIVA value and PCWP in patients undergoing RHC.

{"title": "OBSERVER-BASED CONTROL OF A DUAL-STAGE PIEZOELECTRIC SCANNER.", "abstract": "Despite its proven success in a wide variety of applications, the atomic force microscope (AFM) remains limited by its slow imaging rate. One approach to overcome this challenge is to rely on algorithmic approaches that reduce the imaging time not by scanning faster but by scanning less. Such schemes are particularly useful on older instruments as they can provide significant gains despite the existing (slow) hardware. At the same time, algorithms for sub-sampling can yield even greater improvements in imaging rate when combined with advanced scanners that can be retrofitted into the system. In this work, we focus on the use of a dual-stage piezoelectric scanner coupled with a particular scanning algorithm known as Local Circular Scan (LCS). LCS drives the tip of the AFM along a circular trajectory while using feedback to center that circle on a sample edge and to move the circle along the feature, thus reducing imaging time by concentrating the samples to the region of interest. Dual-stage systems are well-suited to LCS as the algorithm is naturally described in terms of a high-frequency, short range path (the scanning circle) and a slower, long range path (the track along the sample). However, control of the scanner is not straightforward as the system is multi-input, single-output. Here we establish controllability and observability of the scanning stage, allowing us to develop individual controllers for the long-range and short-range actuators through the principle of separation. We then use an internal model controller for the short range actuator to track a sinusoidal input (to generate the circular motion) and a state-space set-point tracking controller for the long range actuator. The results are demonstrated through simulation.", "journal": "Proceedings of the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference.

{"title": "Synergistic effects of the alternating application of low and high frequency ultrasound for particle synthesis in microreactors.", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is a promising method to address clogging and mixing issues in microreactors (MR). So far, low frequency US (LFUS), pulsed LFUS and high frequency US (HFUS) have been used independently in MR for particle synthesis to achieve narrow particle size distributions (PSD). In this work, we critically assess the advantages and disadvantages of each US application method for the case study of calcium carbonate synthesis in an ultrasonic microreactor (USMR) setup operating at both LFUS (61.7\u202fkHz, 8\u202fW) and HFUS (1.24\u202fMHz, 1.6\u202fW). Furthermore, we have developed a novel approach to switch between LFUS and HFUS in an alternating manner, allowing us to quantify the synergistic effect of performing particle synthesis under two different US conditions. The reactor was fabricated by gluing a piezoelectric plate transducer to a silicon microfluidic chip. The results show that independently applying HFUS and LFUS produces a narrower PSD compared to silent conditions. However, at lower flow rates HFUS leads to agglomerate formation, while the reaction conversion is not enhanced due to weak mixing effects. LFUS on the other hand eliminates particle agglomerates and increases the conversion due to the strong cavitation effect. However, the required larger power input leads to a steep temperature rise in the reactor and the risk of reactor damage for long-term operation. While pulsed LFUS reduces the temperature rise, this application mode leads again to the formation of particle agglomerates, especially at low LFUS percentage.

{"title": "A Method and an Experimental Setup for Measuring the Self-Noise of Piezoelectric Hydrophones.", "abstract": "Self-noise of hydrophone is one of the important parameters for critical sonar applications, as it finally decides the lowest detectable signal from a target. To measure the ambient noise of the ocean, the self-noise of the hydrophone should be much less than the sea state zero (SS0) noise. Hence, an experimental setup is required to measure the self-noise generated by the hydrophones. An experimental setup has been designed, developed, and demonstrated. The facility consists of a vibration-isolated and EMI-shielded vacuum chamber which encloses the sample holder assembly and effectively isolates the test hydrophones from external environmental noise sources, such as ground vibrations, electromagnetic interference, and airborne acoustic noises. This enables the measurement of self-noise that is originating purely within the hydrophone. A procedure is developed to remove the noise contribution of the preamplifier including its resistors from the measured output signal of the preamplifier. Uncertainty in measurement using this setup is estimated using the propagation of distribution method through Monte Carlo simulation. This article describes the factors contributing to the self-noise in piezoelectric (PE) transducers, the noise measurement principle, the constructional details of the experimental setup, and the calibration procedure. The technique is demonstrated by measuring the self-noise of a few different types of hydrophones. Thermal noise as low as 0.5 nV / \u221a{Hz} with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 nV / \u221a{Hz} with a confidence level of 95% is achieved.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-09-29", "authors": ["RKrishnakumar", "RRamesh"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2943955"}

Using Huygens' principle, we calculated the delay parameters associated with the excitation signal of each element. Given the respective delay rules, the array transducer produces an adjustable acoustic focused field in the form of a 3-D circular ring. From a theoretical analysis, we designed and fabricated an array transducer with 64 elements and measured its actual field distribution. Simulation and actual experimental results show that the proposed circular cylindrical array transducer controls the annular acoustic focused field well. The sound field intensity of the annular focus region is related to the number of excited array elements, and the radial and axial positions of the annular focus region obey the delay rules of the excitation signal.

{"title": "Intraoperative measurement of intraventricular pressure in dogs with communicating internal hydrocephalus.", "abstract": "Collapse of the lateral cerebral ventricles after ventriculo-peritoneal drainage is a fatal complication in dogs with internal hydrocephalus. It occurs due to excessive outflow of cerebrospinal fluid into the peritoneal cavity (overshunting). In most shunt systems, one-way valves with different pressure settings regulate flow into the distal catheter to avoid overshunting. The rationale for the choice of an appropriate opening pressure is a setting at the upper limit of normal intracranial pressure in dogs. However, physiological intraventricular pressure in normal dogs vary between 5 and 12 mm Hg. Furthermore, we hypothesise that intraventricular pressure in hydrocephalic dogs might differ from pressure in normal dogs and we also consider that normotensive hydrocephalus exists in dogs, as in humans. In order to evaluate intraventricular pressure in hydrocephalic dogs, twenty-three client owned dogs with newly diagnosed communicating internal hydrocephalus were examined before implantation of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt using a single use piezo-resistive strain-gauge sensor (MicroSensor ICP probe). Ventricular volume and brain volume were measured before surgery, based on magnetic resonance images. Total ventricular volume was calculated and expressed in relation to the total volume of the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem (ventricle-brain index). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of the covariates \"age\", \"gender\", \"duration of clinical signs\", \"body weight\", and \"ventricle-brain index\" on intraventricular pressure. The mean cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the hydrocephalic dogs was 8.8 mm Hg (standard deviation 4.22), ranging from 3-18 mm Hg. The covariates \"age\", (P = 0.782), \"gender\" (P = 0.162), \"body weight\", (P = 0.065), or ventricle-brain index (P = 0.27)\" were not correlated with intraventricular pressure. The duration of clinical signs before surgery, however, was correlated with intraventricular pressure (P< 0.0001). Dogs with internal hydrocephalus do not necessarily have increased intraventricular pressure.

{"title": "A Lamb Wave Wavenumber-Searching Method for a Linear PZT Sensor Array.", "abstract": "In this paper, a wavenumber-searching method based on time-domain compensation is proposed to obtain the wavenumber of the Lamb wave array received signal. In the proposed method, the time-domain sampling signal of the linear piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensor array is converted into a spatial sampling signal using the searching wavenumber. The two-dimensional time-spatial-domain Lamb wave received signal of the linear PZT sensor array is then converted into a one-dimensional synthesized spatial sampling signal. Further, the sum of squared errors between the synthesized spatial sampling signal and its Morlet wavelet fitting signal is calculated at each searching wavenumber. Finally, the wavenumber of the Lamb wave array received signal is obtained as the searching wavenumber corresponding to the minimum error. This method was validated on a 2024-T3 aluminum alloy. The validation results showed that the proposed method can successfully obtain the wavenumber of the Lamb wave array received signal, whose spatial sampling rate does not satisfy the Nyquist sampling theorem; the wavenumber error does not exceed 2.2 rad/m.

{"title": "Application of PVDF Organic Particles Coating on Polyethylene Separator for Lithium Ion Batteries.", "abstract": "Surface coating modification on a polyethylene separator serves as a promising way to meet the high requirements of thermal dimensional stability and excellent electrolyte wettability for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this paper, we report a new type of surface modified separator by coating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) organic particles on traditional microporous polyethylene (PE) separators. The PE separator coated by PVDF particles (PE-PVDF separator) has higher porosity (61.4%), better electrolyte wettability (the contact angle to water was 3.28\u00b0 \u00b1 0.21\u00b0) and superior ionic conductivity (1.53 mS/cm) compared with the bare PE separator (51.2%, 111.3\u00b0 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0, 0.55 mS/cm). On one hand, the PVDF organic polymer has excellent organic electrolyte compatibility. On the other hand, the PVDF particles contain sub-micro spheres, of which the separator can possess a large specific surface area to absorb additional electrolyte. As a result, LIBs assembled using the PE-PVDF separator showed better electrochemical performances. For example, the button cell using a PE-PVDF as the separator had a higher capacity retention rate (70.01% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C) than the bare PE separator (62.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C).

We use finite element analysis of the acoustics and compare with experiment. Our finite-element modeling approach is two-pronged; (i) we develop a one-dimensional model that is used as a design tool to optimize the solder stack geometry to match the transducer frequency for maximal acoustic energy transfer and (ii) we use a three-dimensional model to compute the frequency response in the solder stack assembly (solid acoustics) and the acoustic pressure in the liquid solder pool (solid-fluid interaction). The acoustic pressure is a proxy for cavitation and therefore bond strength.

{"title": "Establishment of an Experimental Intracerebral Haemorrhage Model for Mass Effect Research using a Thermo-sensitive Hydrogel.", "abstract": "The mechanical response of brain tissue closely relates to cerebral blood flow and brain diseases. During intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), a mass effect occurs during the initial bleeding and results in significant tissue deformation. However, fewer studies have focused on the brain damage mechanisms and treatment approaches associated with mass effects compared to the secondary brain injuries after ICH, which may be a result of the absence of acceptable animal models mimicking a mass effect. Thus, a thermo-sensitive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel was synthesized and injected into the rat brain to establish an ICH model for mass effect research. The PNIPAM hydrogel or autologous blood was injected to establish an ICH animal model, and the space-occupying volumes, brain tissue elasticity, brain oedema, neuronal cell death, iron deposition and behavioural recovery were evaluated. The lower critical solution temperature of PNIPAM hydrogel was 32\u2009\u00b0C, and the PNIPAM hydrogel had a rough surface with similar topography and pore structure to a blood clot. Furthermore, the ICH model animals who received an injection of PNIPAM and blood produced similar lesion volumes, elasticity changes and mechanically activated ion channel piezo-2 upregulation in brain tissue. Meanwhile, slight iron deposition, neuronal cell death and brain oedema were observed in the PNIPAM hydrogel model compared to the blood model. In addition, the PNIPAM hydrogel showed good biocompatibility and stability in vivo via subcutaneous implantation.

The microsprings were generated by using a coaxial capillary microfluidic device to consecutively spin poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) presolution and an ionic liquid, which formed laminar flows in the coaxial injection microfluidic channels. The fast phase inversion of PVDF helps to form the core-shell structure of a microfiber and guarantees the in situ encapsulation of ionic liquid. The hybrid microfiber can then spiral and be further solidified to maintain the helical structure with increasing flow rates of the injection fluids. Because of the feasible and precise control of the injection fluids during the microfluidic spinning, the resultant microsprings have controlled core-shell structures, helical pitches, and corresponding electromechanical properties.

None of the resonating MEMS structures can operate with low frequency, low amplitude, and unpredictable ambient vibrations since the resonant frequency goes up very high as the structure gets smaller. Bistable buckled beam energy harvester is therefore developed for lowering the operating frequency window below 100Hz for the first time at the MEMS scale. This design does not rely on the resonance of the MEMS structure but operates with the large snapping motion of the beam at very low frequencies when input energy overcomes an energy threshold. A fully functional piezoelectric MEMS energy harvester is designed, monolithically fabricated, and tested. An electromechanical lumped parameter model is developed to analyze the nonlinear dynamics and to guide the design of the nonlinear oscillator based energy harvester. Multilayer beam structure with residual stress induced buckling is achieved through the progressive residual stress control of the deposition processes along the fabrication steps.

{"title": "A Novel Ultrasound Technique Based on Piezoelectric Diaphragms Applied to Material Removal Monitoring in the Grinding Process.", "abstract": "The interest of the scientific community for ultrasound techniques has increased in recent years due to its wide range of applications. A continuous effort of researchers and industries has been made in order to improve and increase the applicability of non-destructive evaluations (NDE). In this context, the monitoring of manufacturing processes, such as the grinding process, arises. This work proposes a novel technique of ultrasound monitoring (chirp-through-transmission) through low-cost piezoelectric diaphragms and digital signal processing. The proposed technique was applied to the monitoring of material removal during the grinding process. The technique is based on changes in ultrasonic waves when propagated through the material under study, with the difference that this technique does not use traditional parameters of ultrasonic techniques but digital signal processing (RMS and Counts). Furthermore, the novelty of the proposed technique is also the use of low-cost piezoelectric diaphragms in the emission and reception of ultrasonic waves, enabling the implementation of a low-cost monitoring system. The results show that the monitoring technique proposed in this work, when used in conjunction with the frequency band selection, is sensitive to the material removal in the grinding process and therefore presents an advance for monitoring the grinding processes.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-09-25", "authors": ["Felipe AAlexandre", "Paulo RAguiar", "ReinaldoG\u00f6tz", "Martin AntonioAulestia Viera", "Thiago GlissoiLopes", "Eduardo CarlosBianchi"], "doi": "10.3390/s19183932\n10.1109/MIM.2006.1637976\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.10.031\n10.1016/j.cirp.2018.04.089\n10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2007.10.013\n10.1007/s00170-010-2643-1\n10.1016/j.cirp.2010.05.010\n10.1016/j.procir.2013.06.127\n10.1049/iet-smt.2016.0317\n10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.211\n10.1007/s001700200080\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.11.031\n10.3390/ecsa-4-04894\n10.3390/ecsa-5-05723\n10.1088/0957-0233/26/4/045601\n10.1109/TIM.2017.2731038\n10.3390/ecsa-5-05732\n10.3390/s18124455\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2725946\n10.3390/s16081266\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2917119\n10.1016/j.cirp.2011.05.003\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)62108-8\n10.3390/ecsa-5-05733\n10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00060-X\n10.1051/matecconf/201824902002\n10.1109/TIM.2009.2018693\n10.1016/j.measurement.2019.01.054\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.10.046\n10.1016/j.measurement.2016.01.041\n10.1109/TIM.2018.2792854\n10.3390/s140101208\n10.3390/s18124453\n10.1177/1045389X17689942\n10.1080/10589759.2015.1058376\n10.3390/s18113699\n10.1177/1475921707081979\n10.1016/j.foodres.2012.05.004\n10.1504/IJISTA.2009.025108\n10.1143/JJAP.47.3894\n10.5755/J01.U.63.3.17073\n10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.12.021\n10.1007/s40430-014-0191-6\n10.1590/S1678-58782006000100014\n10.1016/j.procir.2017.03.043\n10.1016/S0007-8506(07)63075-3\n10.1016/j.coldregions.2014.12.002\n10.1016/j.proeng.2016.06.640\n10.3390/ecsa-4-04927\n10.1504/IJNM.2006.012195\n10.1016/j.triboint.2015.11.045\n10.1016/j.promfg.2018.02.063\n10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.11.187\n10.1016/j.ultras.2009.08.005\n10.1016/j.paerosci.2010.05.001\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.07.058\n10.1177/1045389X10385032\n10.1177/1475921705049752\n10.1049/iet-smt.2018.5178\n10.1177/1475921717715240"}

In this study, we analyzed the influences of system parameters, such as air pressure, nozzle size, needle strokes, and liquid properties, on droplet size and morphology by considering the droplet formation and separation process through a numerical simulation. An experimental platform was also designed to verify the reliability of the simulations and further analyze strategies for controlling the droplet size. We found that the droplet volume can be increased with an increase in air pressure, needle strokes, and nozzle size until the flow-stream or satellite droplets appear. On the other hand, very small values of these parameters will lead to adhesion or micro-dots. A large nozzle and needle displacement should be chosen for the high-viscosity liquid in order to produce normal droplets.

{"title": "The Impact of Different Augmentative Methods on the Expression of Inflammatory Factors.", "abstract": "Many animal studies show that an intact periosteum plays an important role in osseous regeneration. The potential effect of an in vivo periosteal barrier membrane on the expression of specific proteins has not been examined sufficiently. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of the flap preparation method and collagen membrane on the emission of inflammatory factors. This study examines 20 patients with dental implants who had previously undergone an augmentation. A soft tissue sample was taken during augmentation and 3 months later from the same location. Samples were always taken from the margins of a previously prepared mucoperiosteal flap. The flap was raised with a conventional periosteal elevator in the control group and with a piezoelectric device in the test group. In both groups, we covered half of the augmented bone with a native collagen membrane (NCM; Geistlich Bio-Gide). This allowed us to examine the same incision area with and without a membrane. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed for collagen IV, fibronectin, and inflammatory factors such as cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). There was a clear difference in the expression of specific proteins after the piezoelectric device and the periosteal elevator were used. The expression of fibronectin, IL-6, and COX-2 was higher after preparation with the periosteal elevator than after piezoelectric periosteum dissection.

{"title": "Force Sensing by Piezo Channels in Cardiovascular Health and Disease.", "abstract": "Mechanical forces are fundamental in cardiovascular biology, and deciphering the mechanisms by which they act remains a testing frontier in cardiovascular research. Here, we raise awareness of 2 recently discovered proteins, Piezo1 and Piezo2, which assemble as transmembrane triskelions to combine exquisite force sensing with regulated calcium influx. There is emerging evidence for their importance in endothelial shear stress sensing and secretion, NO generation, vascular tone, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, vascular permeability and remodeling, blood pressure regulation, insulin sensitivity, exercise performance, and baroreceptor reflex, and there are early suggestions of relevance to cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. Human genetic analysis points to significance in lymphatic disease, anemia, varicose veins, and potentially heart failure, hypertension, aneurysms, and stroke. These channels appear to be versatile force sensors, used creatively to inform various force-sensing situations.

As composite materials are used in various fields up to date including aircrafts and bridges, inspections are carried out to maintain structural integrity. Although many inspection methods exist for detection damage of composites, most of the techniques require trained experts or a large equipment that can be time consuming. In this study, the possibility of using the piezoelectric material-based non-destructive method known as the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique is used to identify the depth of debonding damage of glass epoxy laminates.

Material components should withstand certain temperatures and loads while maintaining high thermal stability under various weather conditions. Solar modules must demonstrate increased reliability, adequate performance, safety, and durability throughout the course of their lifetime. This work presents a novel solar module. The module consists of an innovative polyvinylidene fluoride-short sugar palm fiber (PVDF-SSPF) composite backsheet within its structure. It was electrically and thermally evaluated. The current-voltage characteristics (I-V) were obtained using the solar module analyzer, PROVA 210PV. A thermal evaluation was accomplished using a temperature device, SDL200. The thermal test consisted of two different assessments. The first targeted the surface and backsheet of the developed module to correlate their performance from within. The second assessment compared the thermal performance of the fabricated backsheet with the conventional one. Both tests were combined into a heatmap analysis to further understand the thermal performance. Results revealed that the developed module exhibited reasonable electrical efficiency, achieving appropriate and balanced I-V curves. PVDF-SSPF backsheets proved to be thermally stable by displaying less heat absorbance and better temperature shifts.

Eighty implant sites were prepared in custom-made solid rigid polyurethane blocks with two different low cancellous bone densities (5 or 15 pounds per cubic foot [PCF]), equally distributed between piezoelectric (Surgysonic Moto, Esacrom, Italy) and conventional drilling techniques. Two short implant systems (Prama and Syra, Sweden & Martina) were tested by inserting 40 fixtures of each system (both 6.0 mm length and 5.0 mm diameter), divided in the four subgroups (drills/5 PCF density; drills/15 PCF density; piezo/5 PCF density; piezo/15 PCF density). Insertion torque (Ncm), implant stability quotient values, removal torque (Ncm), and surgical time were recorded. Data were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and Scheff\u00e9's test (\u03b1 = 0.05). With slight variations among the considered dependent variables, overall high primary implant stability was observed across all subgroups. Piezoelectric instrumentation allowed for comparable or slightly superior primary stability in comparison with the drilling procedures in both implant systems.

Then, the instrument was employed to generate the reverse motion simultaneously to reduce tremor motion. Experimental results show that the tremor compensation mechanism is effective. The average RMS reduction ratio of bench test is 56.5% that is a significant tremor reduction ratio. For hand-held test, it has an average RMS reduction ratio of 41.0%.

{"title": "Surface acoustic wave photonic devices in silicon on insulator.", "abstract": "Opto-mechanical interactions in planar photonic integrated circuits draw great interest in basic research and applications. However, opto-mechanics is practically absent in the most technologically significant photonics platform: silicon on insulator. Previous demonstrations required the under-etching and suspension of silicon structures. Here we present surface acoustic wave-photonic devices in silicon on insulator, up to 8\u2009GHz frequency. Surface waves are launched through absorption of modulated pump light in metallic gratings and thermo-elastic expansion. The surface waves are detected through photo-elastic modulation of an optical probe in standard race-track resonators. Devices do not involve piezo-electric actuation, suspension of waveguides or hybrid material integration.

{"title": "Multidimensional Vibration Suppression Method with Piezoelectric Control for Wind Tunnel Models.", "abstract": "In wind tunnel tests, the low-frequency and large-amplitude vibration of the cantilever sting result in poor test data in pitch plane and yaw plane, more seriously, even threatens the safety of wind tunnel tests. To ensure the test data quality, a multidimensional vibration suppression method is proposed to withstand the vibration from any direction, which is based on a system with stackable piezoelectric actuators and velocity feedback employing accelerometers. Firstly, the motion equation of the cantilever sting system is obtained by Hamilton's principle with the assumed mode method. Then, the multidimensional active control mechanism is qualitatively analyzed and a negative velocity feedback control algorithm combined with a root mean square (RMS) evaluation method is introduced to realize active mass and active damping effect, meanwhile, a weight modification method is performed to determine the sequence number of the stacked piezoelectric actuators and the weight of control voltages in real time. Finally, a multidimensional vibration suppression system was established and verification experiments were carried out in lab and a transonic wind tunnel. The results of lab experiments indicate that the damping ratio of the system is improved more than 4.3 times and the spectrum analyses show reductions of more than 23 dB. In addition, wind tunnel test results have shown that for the working conditions (\u03b1 = -4~10\u00b0 with \u03b3 = 0\u00b0 or \u03b1 = -4~10\u00b0 with \u03b3 = 45\u00b0) respectively at 0.6 Ma and 0.7 Ma, the remainder vibration is less than 1.53 g, which proves that the multidimensional vibration suppression method has the ability to resist vibration from any direction to ensure the smooth process of wind tunnel tests.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-09-19", "authors": ["MengdeZhou", "WeiLiu", "LinlinTang", "ZhuangYao", "ZhengquanWen", "BingLiang", "ZhenyuanJia"], "doi": "10.3390/s19183998\n10.1007/s11018-012-0054-4\n10.2514/1.2929\n10.3390/s18072251\n10.1016/j.cja.2017.04.017\n10.1016/j.cja.2016.12.028\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055013\n10.1155/2018/1905049\n10.1155/2014/524351\n10.3390/s18040947"}

{"title": "Mechanically activated piezo channels modulate outflow tract valve development through the Yap1 and Klf2-Notch signaling axis.", "abstract": "Mechanical forces are well known for modulating heart valve developmental programs. Yet, it is still unclear how genetic programs and mechanosensation interact during heart valve development. Here, we assessed the mechanosensitive pathways involved during zebrafish outflow tract (OFT) valve development in vivo. Our results show that the hippo effector Yap1, Klf2, and the Notch signaling pathway are all essential for OFT valve morphogenesis in response to mechanical forces, albeit active in different cell layers. Furthermore, we show that Piezo and TRP mechanosensitive channels are important factors modulating these pathways. In addition, live reporters reveal that Piezo controls Klf2 and Notch activity in the endothelium and Yap1 localization in the smooth muscle progenitors to coordinate OFT valve morphogenesis. Together, this work identifies a unique morphogenetic program during OFT valve formation and places Piezo as a central modulator of the cell response to forces in this process.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2019-09-17", "authors": ["Anne-LaureDuchemin", "H\u00e9l\u00e8neVignes", "JulienVermot"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.44706\n10.7554/eLife.08201\n10.1242/dev.096768\n10.1093/cvr/cvt040\n10.1172/JCI83083\n10.1242/dev.01970\n10.1242/dev.152124\n10.1242/jeb.00575\n10.1242/jeb.00576\n10.1172/JCI87442\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.201566\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.7554/eLife.28939\n10.1038/nature14670\n10.1016/bs.ctdb.2018.03.006\n10.1038/nature10999\n10.7554/eLife.34110\n10.1038/ncomms2530\n10.1038/s41467-018-04402-6\n10.1038/nature03940\n10.3390/jcdd1030237\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.09.023\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.11.042\n10.1038/ncb3574\n10.1038/nature25744\n10.1016/j.cub.2015.03.038\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)01886-7\n10.1172/jci.insight.124460\n10.1002/dvdy.10356\n10.1242/dev.02087\n10.1177/25.10.72098\n10.1083/jcb.200805124\n10.1172/JCI44555\n10.1073/pnas.1414298111\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.079\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1242/dev.063495\n10.1038/ncomms9329\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.305350\n10.1073/pnas.082695299\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.047\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.308077\n10.1038/s41467-017-01741-8\n10.1016/j.matbio.2006.09.011\n10.1016/j.mod.2014.02.003\n10.1038/ncomms10397\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.02.019\n10.1038/nature14425\n10.1242/dev.076000\n10.1073/pnas.1817070115\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.857987\n10.1242/dev.153411\n10.1016/j.ceb.2018.05.007\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.005\n10.1242/dev.133272\n10.1242/dev.097352\n10.1038/ncb3555\n10.1038/ncomms4520\n10.1038/ng.3383\n10.1038/ncomms9512\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.08.032\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.2174/157340310791162703\n10.1242/dev.125724\n10.1038/s41467-017-02650-6\n10.1093/cvr/cvs238\n10.1242/dev.010694\n10.1242/dev.02827\n10.1038/ng875\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.045\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.014\n10.1038/ncomms11646\n10.1038/ncomms4680\n10.1038/ncb2331\n10.1371/journal.pone.0047644\n10.1038/nprot.2007.514\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.192930\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000246\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv520\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-022516-034001\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253"}

The merocyanine that results from the protonation/ring-opening of the spiropyran form showed single-molecule diode characteristics, with an average current rectification ratio of 5 at \u00b11 V, favoring the orientation where the positively charged end of the molecule is attached to the negative terminal of the circuit. Mechanical pulling of a single spiropyran molecule drives a switch to a more conducting merocyanine state.

Power supply devices are an essential component of bioelectronics to ensure their robust performance. However, conventional power sources are usually bulky, rigid, and potentially contain hazardous constituent materials. The fact that biological organisms are soft, curvilinear, and have limited accommodation space poses new challenges for power supply systems to minimize the interface mismatch and still offer sufficient power to meet clinical-grade applications. Here, recent advances in state-of-the-art nonconventional power options for implantable electronics, specifically, miniaturized, flexible, or biodegradable power systems are reviewed. Material strategies and architectural design of a broad array of power devices are discussed, including energy storage systems (batteries and supercapacitors), power devices which harvest sources from the human body (biofuel cells, devices utilizing biopotentials, piezoelectric harvesters, triboelectric devices, and thermoelectric devices), and energy transfer devices which utilize sources in the surrounding environment (ultrasonic energy harvesters, inductive coupling/radiofrequency energy harvesters, and photovoltaic devices).

Herein, the electrical field distribution around the spinning electrode was studied by the numerical simulation firstly. The results show that the electrical field concentrates on the tip of a protruding droplet under relatively low voltage, while subsequently turns to the edge of needle tip when the protruding droplet disappears under high voltage. The experimental results are well consistent with the numerically simulated results, that is, only one jet forms at low voltage (below 20\u2009kV for PVDF-HFP and PVA nanofiber), but more than one jet forms under high voltage (two jets for PVDF-HFP nanofiber, four jets for PVA nanofiber). These more jets lead to (1) higher fiber diameter resulting from actually weaker electrical field for each jet and (2) wide distribution of fiber diameters due to unstable spinning process (changeable jet number/site/height) under high voltage.

To satisfy the requirements of space applications, the gimbal needs to be high-precision and as small as possible. To meet this need, we designed a small and lightweight gimbal assembly. We adopted piezoelectric ceramic motors instead of a torque motor to ensure driving precision and effectively reduce the mass of the drive unit. The yoke was made from low-volume fraction SiCp/Al with excellent specific stiffness, which ensured rigidity and reduced the mass of the structure. This allowed us to reduce the mass of the gimbal to just 5.8\u2005kg. With a laser communication head mass of 5.55\u2005kg, this gave a load-to-gimbal mass ratio of 95.7%.

The proposed accelerometer is capable of functioning with a constant sensitivity in a large frequency range from 0 to 1 kHz which is much wider than many FBG-based accelerometers. Experimental results obtained from a field test in railway monitoring, demonstrate a broader frequency range for the proposed accelerometer compared to that of the FBG based accelerometer and is comparable to the conventional piezoelectric sensor. The abrupt change in the acceleration measured by the sensor aids in locating any defect or crack present on the railway track. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an accelerometer based on a fiber interferometer aimed for the railway industry.

{"title": "Development of a Magnetic Compound Fluid Rubber Stability Sensor and a Novel Production Technique via Combination of Natural, Chloroprene and Silicone Rubbers.", "abstract": "Expanding on our previous report, we investigate the stability of a magnetic compound fluid (MCF) rubber sensor that was developed for a variety of engineering applications. To stabilize this sensor, we proposed a novel combination technique that facilitates the addition of dimethylpolysiloxane (PDMS) to natural rubber (NR)-latex or chloroprene rubber (CR)-latex using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by experimentally and theoretically investigating issues related to instability. This technique is one of several other novel combinations of diene and non-diene rubbers. Silicone oil or rubber with PDMS can be combined with NR-latex and CR-latex because of PVA's emulsion polymerization behavior. In addition, owing to electrolytic polymerization based on the combination of PDMS and PVA, MCF rubber is highly porous and can be infiltrated in any liquid.

A new needle has been developed that incorporates a piezo element 2-2.3\u00a0mm from the tip, activated by ultrasound. The electrical signal manifests as a coloured circle surrounding the needle tip, and allows real-time tracking. We hypothesised that novice regional anaesthetists would perform nerve block better with the tracker turned on rather than off. Our primary objective was to evaluate the new needle by measuring the performance of novice anaesthetists conducting simulated sciatic block on the soft embalmed Thiel cadaver. Training consisted of a lecture, scanning in volunteers and practice on cadavers. Testing entailed scanning the sciatic nerve of a cadaver and conducting 20 in-plane sciatic blocks in the mid-to-upper thigh region. Subjects were randomised equally, in groups of five, according to the sequence: tracker on/off/on/off; or tracker off/on/off/on. Video recordings were assessed by six raters for steps performed correctly and errors committed. Eight subjects were recruited and 160 videos were analysed. Using the tracking needle, five correct steps improved and one error reduced. The benefits included: better identification of the needle tip before advancing the needle, OR (95%CI) 3.4 (1.6-7.7; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); better alignment of the needle to the transducer, 3.1 (1.3-8.7; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009); and better visibility of the needle tip 3.0 (1.4-7.3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005).

{"title": "Multipoint-Detection Strain Sensor with a Single Electrode Using Optical Ultrasound Generated by Carbon Nanotubes.", "abstract": "With the development of wearable devices, strain sensors have attracted large interest for the detection of human motion, movement, and breathing. Various strain sensors consisting of stretchable conductive materials have been investigated based on resistance and capacitance differences according to the strain. However, this method requires multiple electrodes for multipoint detection. We propose a strain sensor capable of multipoint detection with a single electrode, based on the ultrasound pulse-echo method. It consists of several transmitters of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a single polyvinylidene fluoride receiver. The strain sensor was fabricated using CNTs embedded in stretchable polydimethylsiloxane. The received data are characterized by the different times of transmission from the CNTs of each point depending on the strain, i.e., the sensor can detect the positions of the CNTs. This study demonstrates the application of the multipoint strain sensor with a single electrode for measurements up to a strain of 30% (interval of 1%). We considered the optical and acoustic energy losses in the sensor design.

{"title": "Lamb to Rayleigh Wave Conversion on Superstrates as a Means to Facilitate Disposable Acoustomicrofluidic Applications.", "abstract": "Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have been demonstrated as a powerful and effective means for driving a wide range of microfluidic actuation processes. Traditionally, SAWs have been generated on piezoelectric substrates, although the cost of the material and the electrode deposition process makes them less amenable as low-cost and disposable components. As such, a \"razor-and-blades\" model that couples the acoustic energy of the SAW on the piezoelectric substrate through a fluid coupling layer and into a low-cost and, hence, disposable silicon superstrate on which various microfluidic processes can be conducted has been proposed. Nevertheless, it was shown that only bulk vibration in the form of Lamb waves can be excited in the superstrate, which is considerably less efficient and flexible in terms of microfluidic functionality compared to its surface counterpart, that is, the SAW. Here, we reveal an extremely simple way that quite unexpectedly and rather nonintuitively allows SAWs to be generated on the superstrate-by coating the superstrate with a thin gold layer. In addition to verifying the existence of the SAW on the coated superstrate, we carry out finite-difference time domain numerical simulations that not only confirm the experimental observations but also facilitate an understanding of the surprising difference that the coating makes. Finally, we elucidate the various power-dependent particle concentration phenomena that can be carried out in a sessile droplet atop the superstrate and show the possibility for simply carrying out rapid and effective microcentrifugation-a process that is considerably more difficult with Lamb wave excitation on the superstrate.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2019-09-11", "authors": ["Kiing SWong", "LillianLee", "Yew MHung", "Leslie YYeo", "Ming KTan"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02850"}

Sleep duration is decreased, sleep fragmentation is increased, and the timing of sleep onset and sleep offset is earlier. These disturbances have been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Mouse models for human sleep disturbances can be powerful due to the accessibility to neuroscientific and genetic approaches, but these are hampered by the fact that most mouse models employed in sleep research have spontaneous mutations in the biosynthetic pathway(s) regulating the rhythmic production of the pineal hormone melatonin, which has been implicated in human sleep.\nThe present study employed a non-invasive piezoelectric measure of sleep wake cycles in young, middle-aged and old CBA mice, a strain capable of melatonin biosynthesis, to investigate naturally-occurring changes in sleep and circadian parameters as the result of aging.\nThe results indicate that young mice sleep less than do middle-aged or aged mice, especially during the night, while the timing of activity onset and acrophase is delayed in aged mice compared to younger mice.\nThese data point to an effect of aging on the quality and timing of sleep in these mice but also that there are fundamental differences between control of sleep in humans and in laboratory mice.", "journal": "Nature and science of sleep", "date": "2019-09-10", "authors": ["Jiffin KPaulose", "ChanungWang", "Bruce FO'Hara", "Vincent MCassone"], "doi": "10.2147/NSS.S214423\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.02.004\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.01.013\n10.1016/j.cub.2008.06.047\n10.1016/j.jsmc.2017.09.004\n10.1093/sleep/33.2.211\n10.1097/01.JGP.0000249385.50101.67\n10.1093/sleep/27.7.1255\n10.1111/psyp.2001.38.issue-2\n10.1016/s0006-8993(96)00770-6\n10.1152/ajpregu.1984.246.2.R161\n10.1111/jsr.12371\n10.1016/B978-0-12-396971-2.00001-4\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199604)244:4<552::AID-AR13>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1016/j.arr.2005.07.001\n10.1210/jcem-66-3-648\n10.1016/0531-5565(94)00045-5\n10.1159/000109141\n10.1152/ajpendo.00268.2001\n10.1080/03610737508257952\n10.1371/journal.pone.0081880\n10.1126/SCIENCE.3941912\n10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03708.x\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00095.2018\n10.1186/1475-925X-7-14\n10.5665/sleep.3936\n10.1101/gr.113886.110\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.05.011\n10.3109/02699052.2014.888768\n10.1371/journal.pone.0082507\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.01.035\n10.1142/S0129065716500179\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.11.004\n10.1093/sleep/zsw032\n10.1186/alzrt128\n10.1016/j.sleep.2004.12.005\n10.1038/nrneurol.2013.269\n10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.2334\n10.1093/brain/awn049\n10.1210/jcem.84.1.5394\n10.2147/NSS.S75946\n10.3233/JAD-170900\n10.1016/j.phrs.2018.06.011\n10.1177/074873049701200620\n10.1210/jcem.86.10.7901"}

However, numerous reports have shown that the PFM signal can originate from several non-piezoelectric origins. Among them, because the electrostatic interaction between the AFM tip/cantilever and sample surface can be readily involved, it can be the most important factor during PFM measurement. In particular, in materials with relatively low piezoelectricity, the situation can be more significant because the PFM signals from weak piezoelectricity can be hidden or buried by the electrostatic interactions. Herein, we examined the significance of the electrostatic interactions induced by the surface potential in PFM. Using piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric materials, we examined how the surface potential-dependent electrostatic interactions can significantly affect the PFM signal. We observed that the electrostatically induced PFM amplitude have a linear relationship with the magnitude of surface potential when the instrumental noise floor is properly considered. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions can be significant and their recognition and minimization are essential during PFM and other AFM-based measurements.", "journal": "Ultramicroscopy", "date": "2019-09-09", "authors": ["DaeheeSeol", "SeunghunKang", "ChanghyoSun", "YunseokKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultramic.2019.112839"}

{"title": "Detection of Sleep Biosignals Using an Intelligent Mattress Based on Piezoelectric Ceramic Sensors.", "abstract": "Physiological information such as respiratory rate and heart rate in the sleep state can be used to evaluate the health condition of the sleeper. Traditional sleep monitoring systems need body contact and are intrusive, which limits their applicability. Thus, a comfortable sleep biosignals detection system with both high accuracy and low cost is important for health care. In this paper, we design a sleep biosignals detection system based on low-cost piezoelectric ceramic sensors. 18 piezoelectric ceramic sensors are deployed under the mattress to capture the pressure data. The appropriate sensor that captures respiration and heartbeat sensitively is selected by the proposed channel-selection algorithm. Then, we propose a dynamic smoothing algorithm to extract respiratory rate and heart rate using the selected data. The dynamic smoothing can separate heartbeat signals from respiratory signals with low complexity by dynamically choosing the smooth window, and it is suitable for real-time implementation in low-cost embedded systems. For comparison, wavelet analysis and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) are performed in a personal computer (PC). Experimental results show that data collected by piezoelectric ceramic sensors can be used for respiratory-rate and heart-rate detection with high accuracy. In addition, the dynamic smoothing can achieve high accuracy close to wavelet analysis and EEMD, while it has much lower complexity.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-09-08", "authors": ["MinPeng", "ZhizhongDing", "LushengWang", "XushengCheng"], "doi": "10.3390/s19183843\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.03.016\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849822\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2865487\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00460\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2612938\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2536363\n10.3390/s17010130\n10.1007/s11277-016-3375-9\n10.1109/JBHI.2017.2757530\n10.1016/j.eml.2016.05.015\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2262150\n10.3390/s17010111\n10.1109/JLT.2017.2749499\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2894834\n10.1109/JBHI.2014.2361732\n10.3390/app8122569\n10.1109/SPMB.2017.8257053\n10.1098/rspa.1998.0193\n10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944838\n10.1007/s10015-014-0179-4\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2402652\n10.1145/3291842.3291896\n10.5120/16850-6712\n10.1109/ACSSC.1997.679106\n10.1109/ICCTIDE.2016.7725336\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.05.024\n10.1109/TIP.2010.2050723\n10.1142/S1793536909000047"}

This methodology is used to obtain DCMI signatures from measured raw signatures (RSs) with the surface-bonded piezoelectric sensors (PZT), which is developed from a pertinent electromechanical impedance (EMI) theoretical model for surface-bonded circular PZT. The proposed DCMI methodology has the advantages of simple calculation and magnifying the signatures when compared with the existing methods. Combining the extracted DCMI signatures with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) index is able to quantify the correlation between the health condition and the signatures variation more effectively. To verify the effectiveness of proposed DCMI methodology, experiments are conducted on aluminum plates and a part of fuselage in detail.

Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported by nanofibrous membranes opened new vistas in filtration, catalysis, and serving as most reliable resources in numerous other industrial applications. In this research, hydrogenation of phenol was studied as a model to test the effectiveness of polarized PVDF nanofiber support embedded with agglomerated palladium (Pd) metallic nanoparticle diameters ranging from 5-50 nm supported on polymeric PVDF NFs with ~200 nm in cross-sectional diameters. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and other analytical analysis revealed both molecular and surface morphological changes associated with polarization treatment. The results showed that the fibers mats heated to their curie temperature (150 \u00b0C) increased the catalytic activity and decreased the selectivity by yielding substantial amounts of undesired product (cyclohexanol) alongside with the desired product (cyclohexanone).

Analytical models of the bridge-type amplification mechanism and parallelogram mechanisms are developed by Castigliano's second theorem and a Beam constrained model. The amplification ratio, input stiffness, and output stiffness of the stage are further derived, based on the proposed model. In order to verify the theoretical analysis, the finite element method (FEM) is used for simulation and modal analysis, and the simulation results indicate that the errors of the amplification ratio, input stiffness, and output stiffness of the stage between the proposed model and the FEM results are 2.34%, 3.87%, and 2.66%, respectively.

To tackle issues above, we propose a semi-automatic coupling geophone equipped with a piezoelectric sensor with a spectral range of 10-5000 Hz and a sensitivity of 2.8 V/g. After the geophone was manually pushed into the borehole, it automatically coupled with the tunnel wall under the pressure of the springs within the device. A comparative experiment showed that the data spectrum acquired by the semi-automatic coupling geophone was much higher than that of the conventional geophone equipped with the same piezoelectric sensor. The seismic data were processed in combination with forward modeling. The imaging results also show that the data acquired by the semi-automatic coupling geophone were more in line with the actual geological conditions. In addition, the semi-automatic coupling geophone's installation requires a lower amount of time and cost. In summary, the semi-automatic coupling geophone is able to efficiently acquire seismic data with high fidelity, which can provide a reference for tunnel construction safety.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-09-01", "authors": ["YaoWang", "NengyiFu", "ZhihongFu", "XinglinLu", "XianLiao", "HaowenWang", "ShanqiangQin"], "doi": "10.3390/s19173734\n10.1016/j.eng.2017.07.002\n10.1007/s11709-016-0381-7\n10.1016/j.eng.2017.12.010\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.02.013\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.105737\n10.1007/s11709-017-0440-8\n10.1016/j.tust.2008.01.001\n10.1007/s11770-006-0010-7\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.02.013\n10.3724/SP.J.1235.2010.00232\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2011.11.010\n10.1016/j.tust.2016.12.011\n10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.02.008\n10.3390/s19153360\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.05.044\n10.3390/s19051231\n10.1190/1.1649371\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.05.004\n10.1016/j.tust.2016.01.020\n10.3390/s19051246\n10.1111/1365-2478.12351\n10.1190/1.1442770\n10.1016/S1365-1609(01)00047-8\n10.1071/EG993341\n10.1190/1.3555320\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.11.012"}

However, it is unclear whether nuclear \u03b2-catenin-containing cells within human ACPs possess the characteristics of tumor stem cells, and it is unknown what role these cells have in ACP.\nPrimary ACP cells were cultured from 12 human ACP samples. Adamantinomatous CP stem cell-like cells (CSLCs) showing CD44 positivity were isolated from the cultured primary ACP cells by performing magnetic-activated cell sorting. The tumor sphere formation, cell cycle distribution, stemness marker expression, and multidifferentiation potential of the CD44- cells and the CSLCs were analyzed.\nCompared with the CD44- cells, the cultured human CSLCs formed tumor spheres and expressed CD44 and CD133; moreover, these cells demonstrated nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin. In addition, the CSLCs demonstrated osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacities compared with the CD44- cells. The CSLCs also displayed the capacity for tumor initiation in human-mouse xenografts.\nThese results indicate that CSLCs play an important role in ACP development, calcification, and cystic degeneration.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "date": "2019-08-31", "authors": ["Chao-HuWang", "Song-TaoQi", "JunFan", "JunPan", "Jun-XiangPeng", "JingNie", "YunBao", "Ya-WeiLiu", "Xi'anZhang", "YiLiu"], "doi": "10.3171/2019.5.JNS19565"}

Precursor porous membranes made of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polystyrene-poly(ethylene oxide)-polystyrene (PS-PEO-PS) triblock copolymer composites are prepared by a phase-inversion technique, and the gel polymer electrolyte membranes are finished by in situ hypercrosslinking of the PS segments in precursor membranes.

Second, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 2,547-residue mouse Piezo1 trimer has been determined, providing a solid foundation for studying its structure-function relationship and drug action mechanisms and conducting virtual drug screening. Third, Piezo1 chemical activators, named Yoda1 and Jedi1/2, have been identified through high-throughput screening assays, demonstrating the drugability of Piezo channels.

A 2D ferroelectric semiconductor coupled with the piezo-phototronic effect may bring unprecedented functional characteristics. Here, a heterojunction photodetector made of p-Si/V-doped-ferroelectric-ZnO 2D nanosheets (FESZ-PD) is fabricated, and the ferroelectricity-enhanced piezo-phototronic effect on the photoresponse behavior of the FESZ-PD is carefully investigated. By introducing the ferroelectricity and the piezo-phototronic effect, improved current rectification performance is achieved and the photoresponse performance of the heterojunction is enhanced in a broad spectral range. The applied voltage bias during measurement naturally causes ferroelectric spontaneous polarizations to align, resulting in a change in band structure near the interface and the local piezo-phototronic effect.

{"title": "Comparative Analysis and Strength Estimation of Fresh Concrete Based on Ultrasonic Wave Propagation and Maturity Using Smart Temperature and PZT Sensors.", "abstract": "Recently, the early-age strength prediction for RC (reinforced concrete) structures has been an important topic in the construction industry, relating to project-time reduction and structural safety. To address this, numerous destructive and NDTs (non-destructive tests) are applied to monitor the early-age strength development of concrete. This study elaborates on the NDT techniques of ultrasonic wave propagation and concrete maturity for the estimation of compressive strength development. The results of these comparative estimation approaches comprise the concrete maturity method, penetration resistance test, and an ultrasonic wave analysis. There is variation of the phase transition in the concrete paste with the changing of boundary limitations of the material in accordance with curing time, so with the formation of phase-transition changes, changes in the velocities of ultrasonic waves occur. As the process of hydration takes place, the maturity method produces a maturity index using the time-feature reflection on the strength-development process of the concrete. Embedded smart temperature sensors (SmartRock) and PZT (piezoelectric) sensors were used for the data acquisition of hydration temperature history and wave propagation. This study suggests a novel relationship between wave propagation, penetration tests, and hydration temperature, and creates a method that relies on the responses of resonant frequency changes with the change of boundary conditions caused by the strength-gain of the concrete specimen. Calculating the changes of these features provides a pattern for estimating concrete strength. The results for the specimens were validated by comparing the strength results with the penetration resistance test by a universal testing machine (UTM). An algorithm used to relate the concrete maturity and ultrasonic wave propagation to the concrete compressive strength. This study leads to a method of acquiring data for forecasting in-situ early-age strength of concrete, used for secure construction of concrete structures, that is fast, cost effective, and comprehensive for SHM (structural health monitoring).", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-08-28", "authors": ["NajeebullahTareen", "JunkyeongKim", "Won-KyuKim", "SeungheePark"], "doi": "10.3390/mi10090559\n10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3828(2004)18:1(54)\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.10.180\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.110\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/038\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085021\n10.3390/s17091989\n10.3151/jact.15.94\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.10.079\n10.23881/idupbo.018.1-9i\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.10.006\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2003.10.002\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(154)\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaeea4\n10.1177/0021998318793512\n10.1155/2016/1548215\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.05.001\n10.1080/15732479.2014.920397\n10.1007/s10832-004-5130-y"}

{"title": "A High-Voltage Energy-Harvesting Interface for Irregular Kinetic Energy Harvesting in IoT Systems with 1365% Improvement Using All-NMOS Power Switches and Ultra-low Quiescent Current Controller.", "abstract": "An energy-harvesting interface for kinetic energy harvesting from high-voltage piezoelectric and triboelectric generators is proposed in this paper. Unlike the conventional kinetic energy-harvesting interfaces optimized for continuous sinusoidal input, the proposed harvesting interface can efficiently handle irregular and random high voltage energy inputs. An N-type mosfet (NMOS)-only power stage design is introduced to simplify power switch drivers and minimize conduction loss. Controller active mode power is also reduced by introducing a new voltage peak detector. For efficient operation with potentially long intervals between random kinetic energy inputs, standby power consumption is minimized by monitoring the input with a 43 pW wake-up controller and power-gating all other circuits during the standby intervals. The proposed harvesting interface can harvest energy from a wide range of energy inputs, 10 s of nJ to 10 s of \u00b5J energy/pulse, with an input voltage range of 5-200 V and an output range of 2.4-4 V under discontinuous as well as continuous excitation. The proposed interface is examined in two scenarios, with integrated power stage devices (maximum input 45 V) and with discrete power stage devices (maximum input 200 V), and the harvesting efficiency is improved by up to 600% and 1350%, respectively, compared to the case when harvesting is performed with a full bridge rectifier.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-08-28", "authors": ["HassanSaif", "Muhammad BilawalKhan", "JongminLee", "KyounghoLee", "YoonmyungLee"], "doi": "10.3390/s19173685\n10.1071/WR10211\n10.1109/TCSI.2017.2730638\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2331953\n10.3390/en81112340\n10.3390/mi10010017\n10.3390/mi10030211\n10.3390/s140203323\n10.1109/JSSC.2012.2200530\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2342721\n10.1109/TPEL.2011.2172960\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.049\n10.3390/en11113092"}

{"title": "Air bubble bursting phenomenon at the air-water interface monitored by the piezoelectric-acoustic method.", "abstract": "When an air bubble arrives at the free interface, the bubble's lamella drains and ruptures. The bubble collapses, and gas vapor is released. The ruptured lamella retreats, and a rim at the edge of the retreating lamella forms. The rim becomes unstable and breaks into fine droplets, leading to the formation of a mist. As the collapsing bubble gas's vapor is released, the collapsing bubble oscillates and a vertical liquid jet erupts; this jet then breaks into a droplet(s). Here, we present a novel approach for monitoring the air bubble bursting frequency at the air-water interface by the piezoelectric-pressure-acoustic technique. The piezoelectric-acoustic technique monitors the lamella's rupture time, the frequency of the oscillation of the collapsing air bubble, and the frequency of the oscillation at the free air/water interface. The aqueous lamella rupture thickness was probed by reflected light interferometry, and the air bubble burst at the air/water interface was monitored with the high-speed photo imaging technique. The data obtained by the three techniques provided essential information for the stages of the air bubble collapse dynamics at the free interface without the presence of a surfactant. The simple model proposed by Rayleigh, Minnaert, and Lighthill (RML) for the oscillation resonance of a single air bubble was applied to calculate the air bubble collapsing frequency. The floating air bubble bursting frequency with an equatorial radius of 0.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05\u202fcm was well predicted using the air bubble resonance frequency model, and was estimated as 1.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3\u202fkHz.

Often, these are considered entirely different branches of research; however, considering them simultaneously and holistically can provide several new opportunities. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of hybrid perovskites for high-efficiency solar cells. The intrinsic polar properties of these materials, including the potential for ferroelectricity, provide additional possibilities for simultaneously exploiting several energy conversion mechanisms such as the piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and thermoelectric effect and electrical energy storage. The presence of these phenomena can support the performance of perovskite solar cells. The energy conversion using these effects (piezo-, pyro-, and thermoelectric effect) can also be enhanced by a change in the light intensity. Thus, there lies a range of possibilities for tuning the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of perovskites to simultaneously harvest energy using more than one mechanism to realize an improved efficiency. This requires a basic understanding of concepts, mechanisms, corresponding material properties, and the underlying physics involved with these effects.", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2019-08-24", "authors": ["RichaPandey", "GauravVats", "JaeYun", "Chris RBowen", "Anita W YHo-Baillie", "JanSeidel", "Keith TobiasButler", "Sang IlSeok"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201807376"}

Transmembrane helices 1-36 (TM1-36) are folded into nine tandem units of four transmembrane helices each to form the unusual non-planar blades. The three blades are collectively curved into a nano-dome of 28-nm diameter and 10-nm depth, with an extracellular cap-like structure embedded in the centre and a 9-nm-long intracellular beam connecting to the central pore. TM38 and the C-terminal domain are surrounded by the anchor domain and TM37, and enclose the central pore with both transmembrane and cytoplasmic constriction sites.

{"title": "Photoacoustic Imaging with Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasound Transducers: Principles and Developments.", "abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that bridges the gap between pure optical and acoustic techniques to provide images with optical contrast at the acoustic penetration depth. The two key components that have allowed PAI to attain high-resolution images at deeper penetration depths are the photoacoustic signal generator, which is typically implemented as a pulsed laser and the detector to receive the generated acoustic signals. Many types of acoustic sensors have been explored as a detector for the PAI including Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs), micro ring resonators (MRRs), piezoelectric transducers, and capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs). The fabrication technique of CMUTs has given it an edge over the other detectors. First, CMUTs can be easily fabricated into given shapes and sizes to fit the design specifications. Moreover, they can be made into an array to increase the imaging speed and reduce motion artifacts. With a fabrication technique that is similar to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), CMUTs can be integrated with electronics to reduce the parasitic capacitance and improve the signal to noise ratio. The numerous benefits of CMUTs have enticed researchers to develop it for various PAI purposes such as photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) and photoacoustic endoscopy applications. For PACT applications, the main areas of research are in designing two-dimensional array, transparent, and multi-frequency CMUTs. Moving from the table top approach to endoscopes, some of the different configurations that are being investigated are phased and ring arrays. In this paper, an overview of the development of CMUTs for PAI is presented.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-08-23", "authors": ["JasmineChan", "ZhouZheng", "KevanBell", "MartinLe", "Parsin HajiReza", "John T WYeow"], "doi": "10.3390/s19163617\n10.1364/BOE.1.001117\n10.1002/jbio.201700024\n10.1364/OE.17.007285\n10.1117/1.3595842\n10.1038/s41598-017-18331-9\n10.1117/1.2210907\n10.1364/OE.18.003967\n10.1118/1.3013698\n10.1063/1.2195024\n10.1098/rsfs.2011.0028\n10.1063/1.3141939\n10.1117/1.JBO.21.6.061007\n10.2528/PIER14032303\n10.1038/nmeth.3925\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.05.001\n10.1016/j.pacs.2014.04.002\n10.1364/AO.55.010318\n10.1038/s41377-018-0036-7\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/2/023001\n10.1088/0031-9155/49/7/019\n10.1109/TUFFC.2002.1049742\n10.3390/mi10020152\n10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2592525\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2580152\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2351\n10.1109/TMECH.2011.2159732\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.01.097\n10.1016/j.snb.2019.05.003\n10.1016/j.microrel.2018.12.001\n10.1126/science.1216210\n10.1117/1.JBO.17.5.050506\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.033902\n10.1088/0266-5611/26/11/115003\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.8.086001\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.054\n10.1002/advs.201700277\n10.1007/s00330-017-5209-x\n10.1038/s41467-018-04576-z\n10.1002/lpor.201200060\n10.3390/s19020238\n10.1117/1.3281673\n10.1002/jbio.201800357\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2011.01.006\n10.1007/s13534-014-0153-z\n10.1088/0031-9155/57/23/7853\n10.1364/OL.36.003599\n10.1038/nnano.2014.130\n10.1016/j.pacs.2015.11.001\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.07.017\n10.1364/BOE.3.000792\n10.1364/OL.35.000001\n10.1364/OL.39.004731\n10.1117/1.3194136\n10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.02.001\n10.1117/1.3259361\n10.1016/j.pacs.2019.01.004\n10.1038/nbt1220\n10.3390/s120302467\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2605451\n10.1364/OE.21.006391\n10.1364/OL.40.001350\n10.1038/s41377-018-0070-5\n10.1007/s00330-017-5080-9\n10.1016/j.pacs.2018.07.001\n10.1364/AO.56.005039\n10.3390/s140407451\n10.1364/AO.27.000547\n10.1063/1.4919409\n10.1117/1.OE.53.6.067101\n10.3390/s18041011\n10.1038/srep04496\n10.1364/OL.39.004372\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.11.124\n10.1063/1.4897455\n10.1063/1.1829775\n10.1364/OL.31.002701\n10.1063/1.1896085\n10.1007/s00407-002-0059-5\n10.1063/1.3675892\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1123061\n10.1007/s10832-007-9044-3\n10.3390/s141120825\n10.7567/JJAP.54.07HD08\n10.7567/JJAP.51.07GF02\n10.1118/1.597367\n10.1016/j.pacs.2017.09.001\n10.1016/j.pacs.2017.09.002\n10.1364/OE.20.023944\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.035\n10.1088/0960-1317/21/5/054004\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2003)16:2(76)\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2828423\n10.1063/1.4816085\n10.3390/s150408020\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.22\n10.1364/AO.47.000561\n10.1021/ph500159g\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2702010\n10.1038/nbt839\n10.1109/TUFFc.2009.1329\n10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2049824\n10.1117/1.JBO.21.11.116009\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.3048\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2254\n10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2774283\n10.1364/OE.27.013204\n10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2620381\n10.1364/AO.56.004012\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2792784\n10.1038/s41598-018-33255-8\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1428039\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.256\n10.1109/TUFFC.2007.375\n10.1016/j.sna.2011.09.038\n10.1007/s00542-016-3225-4\n10.1109/JMEMS.2008.918381"}

These membranes are prepared by solvent casting, achieving a thickness in the order of 100-200 \u00b5m. The nanocomposites are characterized in terms of morphological, mechanical, and chemical properties. Analysis of the nanocomposites shows the nanofillers to be homogeneously dispersed in EVA matrix at different vinyl acetate content. Their influence is also noted in the mechanical behavior of thin films, which elastic modulus ranged from about 2 to 25 MPa, while keeping an elongation break from 600% to 1500% and tensile strength from 2 up to 13 MPa. At the same time, doped nanocomposite materials increase their crystallinity degree than the bare ones. The radiopacity provided by the addition of the dopant agents is proven. Finally, the direct piezoelectricity of nanocomposites membranes is demonstrated, showing higher voltage outputs (up to 2.5 V) for stiffer doped matrices.

Herein, we report the high activity of fibrous Cu-based catalysts. The synthesis process is simple and scalable. Electrospinning method was selected to synthesize fibrous polymer substrates (Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene, PVdF-HFP), which are then covered by Cu via electroless deposition. Cu-deposited PVdF-HFP with different microstructures having smooth and roughened surfaces were also synthesized by drop-casting and impregnation method, respectively, to emphasize the importance of the microstructures on OER activity. The OER activity and durability were studied by linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and Tafel slope analysis. The Cu/PVdF-HFP fibrous catalysts exhibit significantly improved OER activity and durability compared with Cu plate as well as Cu-deposited PVdF-HFP with different microstructures. The unique fibrous structure provides better mass transport, diffusion, and large active surface area. In addition to the advantages of the fibrous structure, attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the improved specific activity for Cu/PVdF-HFP fiber can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu and Cu/PVdF-HFP (electron transfer from Cu to PVdF-HFP) at the Cu|PVdF-HFP interface, which results in optimized reaction energetics for the OER.", "journal": "Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry", "date": "2019-08-23", "authors": ["AsukaMorinaga", "HiromoriTsutsumi", "YuKatayama"], "doi": "10.1002/cphc.201900663"}

{"title": "Positioning Error Analysis and Control of a Piezo-Driven 6-DOF Micro-Positioner.", "abstract": "This paper presents a positioning error model and a control compensation scheme for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) micro-positioner based on a compliant mechanism and piezoelectric actuators (PZT). The positioning error model is established by means of the kinematic model of the compliant mechanism and complete differential coefficient theory, which includes the relationships between three typical errors (hysteresis, machining and measuring errors) and the total positioning error. The quantitative analysis of three errors is demonstrated through several experimental studies. Afterwards, an inverse Presiach model-based feedforward compensation of the hysteresis nonlinearity is employed by the control scheme, combined with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback controller for the compensation of machining and measuring errors. Moreover, a back propagation neural network PID (BP-PID) controller and a cerebellar model articulation controller neural network PID (CMAC-PID) controller are also adopted and compared to obtain optimal control. Taking the translational motion along the X axis as an example, the positioning errors are sharply reduced by the inverse hysteresis model with the maximum error of 12.76% and a root-mean-square error of 4.09%. In combination with the CMAC-PID controller, the errors are decreased to 0.63% and 0.23%, respectively. Hence, simulated and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can improve the positioning accuracy of 6-DOF for the micro-positioner.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-08-21", "authors": ["ChaoLin", "ShanZheng", "PingyangLi", "ZhongleiShen", "ShuangWang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi10080542\n10.1109/TMECH.2014.2326865\n10.3390/mi6010080\n10.1109/TCST.2007.902950\n10.1109/TASE.2016.2526641\n10.1063/1.1499761\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2009.03.007\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2016.12.006\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.07.010\n10.1109/TNANO.2013.2242088\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.11.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.12.030\n10.1016/j.cirp.2007.05.086\n10.1115/1.4007640\n10.1016/j.rcim.2004.07.018\n10.1088/0957-0233/19/1/015107\n10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2016275\n10.1016/S0141-6359(97)00014-7\n10.1115/1.4001712\n10.1063/1.4728575\n10.1016/j.conengprac.2014.09.005\n10.1002/asjc.453\n10.1243/09544062JMES1927\n10.1109/TCST.2005.854336\n10.1109/TCST.2008.2001151\n10.1155/2014/760937\n10.1049/iet-cta.2013.0361\n10.1063/1.4876596\n10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2014.12.013"}

{"title": "Development of Self-Focusing Piezoelectric Composite Ultrasound Transducer Using Laser Engraving Technology.", "abstract": "Based on the Fresnel half-wave band interference and laser engraving, a high-frequency self-focusing piezoelectric composite ultrasound transducer (FPCUT) is presented in this article. The theoretical analysis was performed based on the concept of constructive interference of acoustic waves and the electromechanical response of piezoelectric composites. The calculated and simulation results showed that the FPCUT combined the advantages of the composite transducer and the plate self-focusing transducer and can achieve high electromechanical coupling coefficient (>0.66), low acoustic impedance (~15 MRayl), high intensity, and short focal length. Furthermore, a 30-MHz self-focusing piezoelectric composite transducer prototype was fabricated and tested. It is composed of 11 lead zirconate titanates (PZTs) and ten epoxy annuluses. A UV engraving laser with a linewidth of 10 [Formula: see text] was used in each of the PZTs to form the annuluses, and the kerf among the annuluses was filled with epoxy. The measured center frequency, bandwidth, and focal length were 27 MHz, 50.37%, and 3.7 mm, respectively. A vertical wire phantom was imaged using a fabricated transducer and a contrast flat transducer; the images showed significant improvement in the lateral resolution over a range of 9 mm. Because this self-focusing piezoelectric composite transducer was based on the precise laser engraving systems, the fabrication process was accurate and controllable, which enabled it to have good potential for medical imaging and industrial nondestructive testing applications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-08-20", "authors": ["XiaohuaJian", "PengboLiu", "ZhangjianLi", "JiabingLv", "ChenYang", "PeiyangLi", "YaoyaoCui"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2935215"}
{"title": "Electrophysiological Recordings of Single-cell Ion Currents Under Well-defined Shear Stress.", "abstract": "Fluid shear stress is well known to play a major role in endothelial function. In most vascular beds, elevated shear stress from acute increases in blood flow triggers a signaling cascade resulting in vasodilation thereby alleviating mechanical stress on the vascular wall. The pattern of shear stress is also well known to be a critical factor in the development of atherosclerosis with laminar shear stress being atheroprotective and disturbed shear stress being pro-atherogenic. While we have a detailed understanding of the various intermediate cell signaling pathways, the receptors that first translate the mechanical stimulus into chemical mediators are not completely understood. Mechanosensitive ion channels are critical to the response to shear and regulate shear-induced cell signaling thereby controlling the production of vasoactive mediators. These channels are among the earliest activated signaling components to shear and have been linked to shear-induced vasodilation through promoting nitric oxide production (e.g., inwardly rectifying K", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2019-08-20", "authors": ["Ibra SFancher", "IrenaLevitan"], "doi": "10.3791/59776"}
{"title": "Control of stress and damage in structures by piezoelectric actuation: 1D theory and monofrequent experimental validation.", "abstract": "This contribution presents novel results on feed-forward control of stress in piezoelectric structures by means of piezoelectric actuation. For that sake, we focus on a one-dimensional benchmark problem, a piezoelectric transducer that is excited by a piezoelectric stack actuator. We investigate the following problem: Is it possible to actuate the piezoelectric transducer in such a manner that the dominant axial stress component is nullified. In order to find a theoretical solution for this question, we discretize our system as a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) model. The equations of motion are transformed into the differential equations for the inner forces by taking advantage of the constitutive relations, which relate displacement, stress, and electric field. Finally, we find a mathematical relation for the piezoelectric transducer excitation in order to annihilate the transducer force. A static and a frequency-dependent approximate solution for the transducer actuation signal are derived. The latter solution reduces the inner force drastically in a certain frequency range. After numerical results for the force-control algorithm are presented, we finally experimentally verify our theory: First, the force-controlled configuration is exposed to a monofrequent harmonic excitation test run for 30\u00a0min, showing no sign of fatigue or material failure, because the transducer force is below the ultimate tensile strength. Then, the system is excited by the same harmonic excitation again, but the control signal for the piezoelectric transducer is turned off. The result is a visible damage of the piezoelectric transducer, leading to a significant change of the first eigenfrequency.", "journal": "Structural control & health monitoring", "date": "2019-08-20", "authors": ["JuergenSchoeftner", "AndreasBrandl", "HansIrschik"], "doi": "10.1002/stc.2338"}

Following this concept in our studies, first, we developed well-controlled processing of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film to obtain a surface biomimicking ECM. We optimized the manufacturing dependent on humidity and temperature during spin-coating of a polymer solution. The mixture of solvents such as dimethylacetamide and acetone together with high humidity conditions led to a biomimetic, highly porous and rough surface, while with lower humidity and high temperatures drying allowed us to obtain a smooth and flat PVDF film. The roughness of the PVDF film was biofabricated and compared to smooth films in cell culture studies for adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts. The bioinspired roughness of our films enhanced the osteoblast adhesion by over 44%, and there was collagen formation already after 7 days of cell culturing that was proved via scanning electron microscopy observation, light microscopy imaging after Sirius Red staining, and proliferation test such as MTS.

{"title": "Sensor data fusion for responsive high resolution ultrasonic temperature measurement using piezoelectric transducers.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic temperature measurement allows for responsive measurements across an entire ultrasonic pathway, unlike most conventional temperature sensors that respond to the temperature at the point of their placement only after a notable response time. The high cost of required ultrasonic instrumentation can be reduced substantially by using ultrasonic oscillating temperature sensors (UOTS) consisting of inexpensive narrowband piezo transducers and driving electronics. An UOTS produces sustained oscillations at a frequency that relates to the temperature of the medium between the transducers. The existence of thermal hysteresis in UOTS readings, observed experimentally and apparently related to the fundamental properties of piezoelectric materials, makes conversion of the output frequency readings to the temperature values ambiguous. This makes it complicated to calibrate and use UOTS on their own. In the reported experiment (heating, then naturally cooling of a water vessel equipped with both UOTS and conventional sensors), this hysteresis was solved by fusing UOTS data with conventional temperature sensor readings. As the result, the combination of one UOTS plus one conventional reference sensor allowed improving both the temperature resolution and responsiveness of the latter and ambiguity of the readings of the former. Data fusion effectively led to calibrating the UOTS at every change of the conventional sensor's reading, removing any concerns related to the thermal expansion/contraction of the ultrasonic pathway itself and/or hysteresis of piezoelectric transducers.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2019-08-20", "authors": ["AnasHashmi", "Alexander NKalashnikov"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2019.105969"}

Ultra-miniature gradient index lens technology (patent number: 201320241218.7) was used to create a thin endoscopic probe with a diameter of 0.86 mm for real-time image transmission. The SS-OCT light source had a wavelength of 1 310 nm and a bandwidth of 100 nm. The axial and transverse image resolutions were 15 \u03bcm and 25 \u03bcm, respectively. Artificial fractures were created on human mandibular premolars with single root and the premolar roots were prepared to 41 horizontal sections (1 mm thick). 27 root sections with fractures (width: 52-284 \u03bcm) and 14 the sections without fractures were observed under an optical stereomicroscope with a cold light source as the gold standard. The horizontal root sections were scanned by self-developed SS-OCT imaging system for root canal endoscopy with a central wavelength of 1 310 nm and bandwidth of 100 nm. The data were reconstructed with 30 \u03bcm thick slices at an interval of 30 \u03bcm. Two observers, a radiologist and an endodontist, were trained and independently evaluated all the reconstructed images blindly. The diagnostic performance of SS-OCT imaging system was calculated, and statistical analysis was performed.\nSS-OCT root canal endoscopic imaging system composed of high-speed swept laser source, fiber coupler, endoscopic probe, reference arm and differential detector. Root sections could be scanned by SS-OCT and imaged in realtime at a depth of 1 to 2 mm.

In this work, composites based on two types of polyethylene-high density polyethylene (HDPE), and medium density polyethylene (MDPE)-and aluminosilicate fillers were obtained by extrusion process. This method allowed obtaining flexible electrets in the form of a thin film after polarization under a constant electric field of 100 V/\u03bcm. The morphology of the composites was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, whereas the crystallinity was determined by X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties and thermal stability of the composites were examined by means of tensile tests and thermogravimetry, respectively. The piezoelectric characteristics were appointed by measuring the electric charge and the voltage in the polarized samples. Piezoelectric coefficients, and the stability of electrets over time were also determined. Moreover, the effect of film orientation on piezoelectric properties was investigated. Composites with appropriate morphology (i.e., well dispersed filler particles in the polymer matrix and formed holes) were obtained which ensured permanent electrical polarization. It was found that the best piezoelectric, mechanical properties and thermal stability exhibits HDPE composite with 5% of aluminosilicate filler.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-08-16", "authors": ["HalinaKaczmarek", "Bogus\u0142awKr\u00f3likowski", "MartaChyli\u0144ska", "EwaKlimiec", "DagmaraBajer"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11081345\n10.3934/matersci.2018.5.845\n10.1126/science.aav3057\n10.1126/science.aai8535\n10.1021/jacs.7b12524\n10.3390/nano7100308\n10.3390/ma11091698\n10.1070/RCR4860\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2015.08.002\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/3/033001\n10.1038/s41928-018-0189-7\n10.1088/2053-1591/3/7/075702\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.08.043\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2018.01.005\n10.1007/s42114-018-0023-8\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2017.04.004\n10.1021/acs.macromol.5b01964\n10.3390/polym10030228\n10.1002/mame.201800463\n10.3390/s18113605\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.020\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.074\n10.3390/c3040030\n10.3390/polym9020062\n10.1007/s11664-015-3719-3\n10.14314/polimery.2017.539\n10.1007/s10854-016-6329-9\n10.1177/026248931803700301\n10.1515/pac-2018-0702\n10.1007/s10854-017-7575-1\n10.1021/ma5025736\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.10.007\n10.1080/2055074X.2016.1252548\n10.1021/acsmacrolett.6b00941\n10.3144/expresspolymlett.2016.29\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.07.011\n10.1002/app.47540\n10.1039/c3cs60032g\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006"}

There were 16 males and 22 females, aged from 21 to 72 years (mean, 47.1 years). The disease duration ranged from 6 to 57 months (mean, 32.6 months). Pathological examination showed 24 cases of schwannoma, 6 cases of meningioma, 4 cases of ependymoma, 2 cases of lipoma, and 2 cases of dermoid cyst. The lesions located in 18 cases of single segment, 15 cases of double segments, and 5 cases of three segments. The length of the tumors ranged from 0.7 to 6.5 cm. There were boundaries between the tumors and the spinal cord, cauda equina, and nerve roots.

While liquid-phase fluorescence spectroscopy excitation emission matrix (LPF-EEM) has previously been applied to identify the characteristics of membrane foulants, we applied EEM measurements to solid samples to identify foulants accumulated on the membrane. This solid-phase fluorescence EEM (SPF-EEM) enables sensitive and nondestructive identification of different organic solids. LPF-EEMs and SPF-EEMs were used on natural organic matter (NOM) isolated from secondary-treated wastewater, which revealed differences in peak positions and in spectral shapes. SPF-EEMs and LPF-EEMs of hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPI) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions showed that peaks of HPO fraction disappeared while those of TPI and HPI fractions shifted to a longer excitation and emission position through solidification. Then, the surface of the membrane fiber was continuously monitored using SPF-EEM during filtration. Three peaks appeared as expected during membrane fouling progression, indicating that in-situ monitoring of foulants was successful. Comparison of the EEM peaks between foulants and isolated NOM fractions shows the presence of both liquid-phase proteinaceous substances and gels formed from HPI and TPI fractions. Changes in peak intensity confirmed that the former proteinaceous substances were responsible for both reversible and irreversible fouling, while the latter gels mainly contributed to the irreversible fouling. We demonstrated the functionality of the SPF-EEM as an in-situ fouling monitoring tool.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2019-08-14", "authors": ["HiroshiYamamura", "QingDing", "YoshimasaWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2019.114928"}

A large number of works have shown that the best-performing organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are obtained on low-surface-energy substrates. The meniscus instabilities that occur when coating on such surfaces considerably limit the effective deposition speeds. This represents a limiting factor for the upscaling of device fabrication for mass production, an issue that needs to be addressed if organic electronic devices are ever to become commercially relevant. In this work, we present a method to increase the accessible window of coating speeds for the solution shearing of donor-acceptor semiconductor polymers for the fabrication of OFETs. By incorporating a piezo crystal that is capable of producing high-frequency vibrations into the coating head, we are able to mitigate contact line instabilities due to the depinning of the contact line, thereby suppressing the commonly encountered \"stick-and-slip\" phenomenon.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-08-14", "authors": ["CeciliaTeixeira da Rocha", "GeQu", "XuegengYang", "RishiShivhare", "MikeHambsch", "YingDiao", "Stefan C BMannsfeld"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b07832"}

The presence of the N microcatheter, led to reduced values of FFR measured by P or C guidewires (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). The concomitant presence of P and C guidewires led to significantly lower FFR values (p\u2009<\u2009.0001) measured by P but not by C. In clinically relevant conditions, values of FFR measured by the optic-sensor C guidewire and N catheter were similar and lower than those measured by the P guidewire (p\u2009<\u2009.0001).

The trials used very similar intervention methods to promote physical activity and had annual follow-up over a 36-month period.

It has been experimentally established that in both cases, with an increase in the width of the gap between the free side of the piezoelectric resonator and thin aluminum film, the frequency of the parallel resonance and maximum value of the real part of the electrical impedance increase and reach saturation. Besides, it has been shown that the relative change of these values with a change in the width of the gap in the range 10-300\u202f\u03bcm increases with decreasing the thickness of the resonator. In this case, the frequency of the series resonance practically does not change. It has been also established that the sensitivity of the resonator to the presence of a conducting film at the resonant frequency of ~96\u202fkHz is significantly higher in comparison with the resonant frequency of ~260\u202fkHz.

{"title": "Nondestructive Analysis of Debonds in a Composite Structure under Variable Temperature Conditions.", "abstract": "This paper presents a nondestructive analysis of debonds in an adhesively-bonded carbon-fibre reinforced composite structure under variable temperature conditions. Towards this, ultrasonic guided wave propagation based experimental analysis and numerical simulations are carried out for a sample composite structure to investigate the wave propagation characteristics and detect debonds under variable operating temperature conditions. The analysis revealed that the presence of debonds in the structure significantly reduces the wave mode amplitudes, and this effect further increases with the increase in ambient temperature and debond size. Based on the debond induced differential amplitude phenomenon, an online monitoring strategy is proposed that directly uses the guided wave signals from the distributed piezoelectric sensor network to localize the hidden debonds in the structure. Debond index maps generated from the proposed monitoring strategy show the debond identification potential in the adhesively-bonded composite structure. The accuracy of the monitoring strategy is successfully verified with non-contact active infrared-thermography analysis results. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring strategy is further investigated for the variable debond size and ambient temperature conditions.

However, the complex physical mechanisms linking mechanical and electrical properties make these materials hard to understand. Computationally onerous models have historically been unable to adequately describe dynamic phenomena inside real piezoelectric materials, and are often limited to over-simplified first-order analytical, quasi-static, or unsatisfying phenomenological numerical approaches. We present a generalized dynamic analytical model based on first-principles that is efficiently computable and better describes these exciting materials, including higher-order coupling effects. We illustrate the significance of this model by applying it to the important 3m crystal symmetry class of piezoelectric materials that includes lithium niobate, and show that the model accurately predicts the experimentally observed impedance spectrum. This dynamic behavior is a function of almost all intrinsic properties of the piezoelectric material, so that material properties, including mechanical, electrical, and dielectric coefficients, can be readily and simultaneously extracted for any size crystal, including at the nanoscale; the only prior knowledge required is the crystal class of the material system.

{"title": "Ultrathin Ceramic Piezoelectric Films via Room-Temperature Electrospray Deposition of ZnO Nanoparticles for Printed GHz Devices.", "abstract": "High-frequency devices are key enablers of state-of-the-art electronics used in a wide and diverse range of exciting applications such as inertial navigation, communications, power conversion, medicine, and parallel computing. However, high-frequency additively manufactured piezoelectric devices are yet to be demonstrated due to shortcomings in the properties of the printed transducing material and the attainable film thickness. In this study, we report the first room-temperature-printed, piezoelectric, ultrathin (<100 nm) ceramic films compatible with high-frequency (>1 GHz) operation. The films are made of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles via near-field electrohydrodynamic jetting, achieving film piezoelectricity, without high-temperature processing, through a novel mechanism that is controlled during the deposition.\u00a0Optimization of the printing process and feedstock formulation results in homogeneous traces as narrow as 213 \u03bcm and as thin as 53 nm as well as uniform field films as thin as 91 nm; the printing technique can be used with flexible and rigid, conductive and insulating substrates. The crystallographic orientation of the imprints toward the (100) plane increases if the rastering speed during printing is augmented, resulting in a larger piezoelectric response. The resonant frequency of film bulk acoustic resonators increases monotonically with the rastering speed, achieving transmission values as high as 4.99 GHz, which corresponds to an acoustic velocity of 2094 m/s, similar to the expected transverse value in high-temperature-grown ZnO films.

While skin soft electronic tattoos (e-tattoos) have been widely reported for electrocardiogram (ECG) sensing, wearable SCG sensors are still based on either rigid accelerometers or non-stretchable piezoelectric membranes. This work reports an ultrathin and stretchable SCG sensing e-tattoo based on the filamentary serpentine mesh of 28-\u00b5m-thick piezoelectric polymer, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). 3D digital image correlation (DIC) is used to map chest vibration to identify the best location to mount the e-tattoo and to investigate the effects of substrate stiffness. As piezoelectric sensors easily suffer from motion artifacts, motion artifacts are effectively reduced by performing subtraction between a pair of identical SCG tattoos placed adjacent to each other. Integrating the soft SCG sensor with a pair of soft gold electrodes on a single e-tattoo platform forms a soft electro-mechano-acoustic cardiovascular (EMAC) sensing tattoo, which can perform synchronous ECG and SCG measurements and extract various cardiac time intervals including systolic time interval (STI). Using the EMAC tattoo, strong correlations between STI and the systolic/diastolic blood pressures, are found, which may provide a simple way to estimate blood pressure continuously and noninvasively using one chest-mounted e-tattoo.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2019-08-06", "authors": ["TaewooHa", "JasonTran", "SiyiLiu", "HongwooJang", "HyoyoungJeong", "RuchikaMitbander", "HeeyongHuh", "YitaoQiu", "JasonDuong", "Rebecca LWang", "PulinWang", "AnimeshTandon", "JayantSirohi", "NanshuLu"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.201900290"}

Traditional piezoelectric materials are inefficient at low frequencies but composite structures can increase efficiency at these frequencies. Compliant layer adaptive composite stack (CLACS) is a new piezoelectric PZT (lead zirconate titanate) structure designed for orthopedic implants to use loads generated during walking to provide electrical stimulation for bone healing. The CLACS structure increases power efficiency and structural properties as compared to PZT alone. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of compliant layer and encapsulation thicknesses on strain-related parameters for CLACS predicted by finite element models. Percent changes in strain as compliant layer thickness increased were compared to percent changes in power experimentally produced by CLACS given similar geometries and loading conditions. Percent changes in PZT z-strain matched the trends for increases in experimental power, but was not directly proportional. PZT z-strain and radial strain increased as compliant layer and top and bottom encapsulation thickness increased. PZT z-strain and radial strain decreased as side encapsulation thickness increased for a normalized distributed force on the PZT.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Shunt Stiffness in Rhombic Piezoelectric Stack Transducer with Hybrid Negative-Impedance Shunts: Theoretical Modeling and Stability Analysis.", "abstract": "Negative-capacitance shunted piezoelectric polymer was investigated in depth due to its considerable damping effect. This paper discusses the novel controlled stiffness performance from a rhombic piezoelectric stack transducer with three hybrid negative-impedance shunts, namely, negative capacitance in series with resistance, negative capacitance in parallel with resistance, and negative inductance/negative capacitance (NINC) in series with resistance. An analytical framework for establishing the model of the coupled system is presented. Piezoelectric shunt stiffness (PSS) and piezoelectric shunt damping (PSD) are proposed to analyze the stiffness and damping performances of the hybrid shunts. Theoretical analysis proves that the PSS can produce both positive and negative stiffness by changing the negative capacitance and adjustable resistance. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and the root locus method are utilized to judge the stability of the three hybrid shunts. The results point out that the negative capacitance should be selected carefully to sustain the stability and to achieve the negative stiffness effect of the transducer. Furthermore, negative capacitance in parallel with resistance has a considerably better stiffness bandwidth and damping performance than the other two shunts.

{"title": "Ultrathin Planar Metasurface-based Acoustic Energy Harvester with Deep Subwavelength Thickness and Mechanical Rigidity.", "abstract": "Despite the growing attentions dedicated to the harvesting of acoustic energy that is a clean and renewable yet usually wasted energy source, the long wavelength of airborne sound still poses fundamental limits on the miniaturization of harvester devices and hinders practical applications. Here we present an ultrathin and planar acoustic energy harvester with rigidity. We propose a distinctive metasurface-based mechanism that reduces the effective wavelength to produce extraordinarily strong local energy within deep-subwavelength dimension and enable high-efficiently harvesting energy of incident airborne sound with considerably long wavelength. Our design idea is implemented by a foldy-structured metasurface capable of confining low-frequency energy within narrow channel at resonance, with a piezoelectric plate judiciously placed to converse acoustic to electric energy.

An appropriate substrate solution is applied to the membrane, and the signal is detected in the course of the enzymatic reaction, resulting either in development of insoluble colored products (chromogenic substrates) or in generation of light (chemiluminescent substrates).

In this study, ABRs were measured in response to up-chirps in three killer whales (Orcinus orca) and compared to ABRs evoked by broadband clicks. Chirp durations ranged from 125\u2009-\u20092000 \u03bcs. Chirp spectral content was either \"uncompensated,\" meaning the spectrum paralleled the transmitting response of the piezoelectric transducer, or \"compensated,\" where the spectral density level was flat (+/-4 dB) across the stimulus bandwidth (10\u2009-\u2009130 kHz). Compensated up-chirps consistently produced higher amplitude ABRs than uncompensated clicks with the same peak equivalent sound pressure level. ABR amplitude increased with up-chirp duration up to 1400 \u03bcs, although there was considerable variability between individuals. Results suggest that compensating stimuli for the response of transducers can have a dramatic effect on broadband ABRs, and that compensated up-chirps might be useful for testing whale species where large size makes far-field recording of ABRs at the skin surface difficult.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2019-08-03", "authors": ["Dorian SHouser", "JasonMulsow", "JavierAlmunia", "James JFinneran"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5116141"}

With the development of high speeds and heavy loads, the appearance of fatigue cracks in the bogie frames is increasing, which reduces the driving life of railway vehicles and even causes serious traffic accidents. Real-time monitoring on the integrity of the bogie is an inevitable requirement for ensuring the safe operation of railway vehicles. In this paper, ultrasonic guided wave-based active structural health monitoring (SHM) was developed to identify the fatigue crack of the bogie frame. Experiments were conducted on a welded T-shape specimen with a thickness of 12 mm. A total of 10 piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) disks were mounted around the weld zone of the specimen, five of which were used as actuators, and the other five were used as sensors. Five-peak modulation narrow-band sine waves were input into the actuators to excite the specimen. From the sensor signals, the advanced damage index (DI) was calculated to identify the propagation of the crack. The experimental results demonstrate that crack damage as small as 2 mm in the weld zone of the bogie frame can be successfully detected. Some practical issues for implementing the SHM in real applications, such as crack quantification and environmental compensation, were also discussed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-08-03", "authors": ["JiajiaYan", "HashenJin", "HuSun", "XinlinQing"], "doi": "10.3390/s19153372\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.11.017\n10.1051/matecconf/201815702051\n10.1016/j.ress.2019.03.033\n10.1016/j.wear.2018.10.016\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.12.007\n10.1016/j.engfailanal.2018.10.016\n10.1016/j.measurement.2015.11.014\n10.3390/s19030545\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.9.061001\n10.1177/1045389X06059956\n10.1088/1361-665X/aae54e\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/3/020\n10.1177/1475921711430439\n10.1177/1475921713498532\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2007.07.003\n10.1016/j.wavemoti.2011.01.001\n10.1111/j.1460-2695.2008.01253.x\n10.1088/1361-665X/aad52f\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/10/105007\n10.1177/1045389X10361632\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/095015\n10.3390/s19081856\n10.3390/s18113958\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.385-387.645\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/12/125005\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.01.020\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/3/N03\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085035\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.05.004\n10.1177/1550147719843054\n10.3390/s16030291\n10.3390/s19092180"}

Although the piezoelectricity of tissue-derived collagen has been documented across the length scales, little work has been undertaken to characterise the local electromechanical properties of processed collagen, which is used as a base for tissue-engineering implants. In this work, three chemically distinct treatments used to form structurally and mechanically stable scaffolds-EDC-NHS, genipin and tissue transglutaminase-are investigated for their effect on collagen piezolectricity. Crosslinking with EDC-NHS is noted to produce a distinct self-assembly of the fibres into bundles roughly 300 nm in width regardless of the collagen origin. These fibre bundles also show a localised piezoelectric response, with enhanced vertical piezoelectricity of collagen. Such topographical features are not observed with the other two chemical treatments, although the shear piezoelectric response is significantly enhanced upon crosslinking. These observations are reconciled by a proposed effect of the crosslinking mechanisms on the molecular and nanostructure of collagen.

{"title": "Development of a Novel Three Degrees-of-Freedom Rotary Vibration-Assisted Micropolishing System Based on Piezoelectric Actuation.", "abstract": "The limited degrees of freedom (DOF) and movement form of the compliant vibration-assisted processing device are inherent constraints of the polishing technique. In this paper, a concept of a 3-DOF rotary vibration-assisted micropolishing system (3D RVMS) is proposed and demonstrated. The 3-DOF means the proposed vibration-assisted polishing device (VPD) is driven by three piezo-electric (PZT) actuators. Compared with the current vibration-assisted polishing technology which generates a trajectory with orthogonal actuators or parallel actuators, a novel 3-DOF piezoelectrically actuated VPD was designed to enable the workpiece to move along the rotational direction. Meanwhile, the proposed VPD can deliver large processing stoke in mrad scale and can be operated at a flexible non-resonant mode. A matrix-based compliance modeling method was adopted for calculating the compliance and amplification ratio of the VPD. Additionally, the dynamic and static properties of the developed VPD were verified using finite element analysis. Then, the VPD was manufactured and experimentally tested to investigate its practical performance.

{"title": "Localization of Transient Events Threatening Pipeline Integrity by Fiber-Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing.", "abstract": "Pipe integrity is a central concern regarding technical safety, availability, and environmental compliance of industrial plants and pipelines. A condition monitoring system that detects and localizes threats in pipes prior to occurrence of actual structural failure, e.g., leakages, especially needs to target transient events such as impacts on the pipe wall or pressure waves travelling through the medium. In the present work, it is shown that fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) in conjunction with a suitable application geometry of the optical fiber sensor allows to track propagating acoustic waves in the pipeline wall on a fast time-scale. Therefore, short impacts on the pipe may be localized with high fidelity. Moreover, different acoustic modes are identified, and their respective group velocities are in good agreement with theoretical predications. In another set of experiments modeling realistic damage scenarios, we demonstrate that pressure waves following explosions of different gas mixtures in pipes can be observed. Velocities are verified by local piezoelectric pressure transducers. Due to the fully distributed nature of the fiber-optic sensing system, it is possible to record accelerated motions in detail. Therefore, in addition to detection and localization of threatening events for infrastructure monitoring, DAS may provide a powerful tool to study the development of gas explosions in pipes, e.g., investigation of deflagration-to-detonation-transitions (DDT).", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-08-01", "authors": ["Maria-TeresaHussels", "SebastianChruscicki", "DetlefArndt", "SwenScheider", "JensPrager", "TobiasHomann", "Abdel KarimHabib"], "doi": "10.3390/s19153322\n10.3390/s16050748\n10.1016/j.jngse.2009.08.002\n10.1115/1.3062942\n10.1364/OE.22.013804\n10.1109/JLT.2016.2542981\n10.3390/s17020355\n10.1109/JLT.2005.849924\n10.1364/AO.46.001968\n10.1190/tle32060699.1\n10.3997/1365-2397.2013034\n10.1111/1365-2478.12116\n10.1038/s41467-018-04860-y\n10.1109/LPT.2014.2346760\n10.1364/AO.37.005600\n10.1109/JLT.2015.2449085\n10.3390/app7080841\n10.1007/s13320-017-0360-1\n10.3390/s18092841\n10.1002/stc.1771\n10.1111/1365-2478.12303\n10.1111/1365-2478.12358\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.11.029\n10.1109/JLT.2016.2557586\n10.1016/j.jlp.2010.12.007\n10.1016/j.jlp.2015.11.005"}

Soft robots made of polymeric materials have the potential to achieve both attributes simultaneously. Inspired by nature, this research presents soft robots based on a curved unimorph piezoelectric structure whose relative speed of 20 body lengths per second is the fastest measured among published artificial insect-scale robots. The soft robot uses several principles of animal locomotion, can carry loads, climb slopes, and has the sturdiness of cockroaches. After withstanding the weight of an adult footstep, which is about 1 million times heavier than that of the robot, the system survived and continued to move afterward. The relatively fast locomotion and robustness are attributed to the curved unimorph piezoelectric structure with large amplitude vibration, which advances beyond other methods.

However, full realization of these applications is still challenging due to the lack of high quality films with strong piezoelectricity, which requires tailored molecular organization. Here we report unique 'full nanowire' P(VDF-TrFE) films with substantially enhanced bidirectional performance by a simple self-assembly via selective vapor annealing. Structural analysis showed that the solvent molecules significantly enhanced the copolymer chain mobility, giving highly ordered nanowires, whose quantity increased with time and finally formed a full flat-on lamellar nanowire array with backbones highly aligned along the film plane, leading to high lateral piezoelectricity as revealed by vector piezoresponse force microscopy and confirmed by electrical measurements. Surprisingly, the nanowire films also showed a much higher vertical piezoelectric coefficient (-35.2 pC N-1 directly measured by using a Berlincourt meter) than that of usually crystallized films owing to simultaneously enhanced molecular order and dipole switching ability.

{"title": "The response of the pediatric head to impacts onto a rigid surface.", "abstract": "The study of pediatric head injury relies heavily on the use of finite element models and child anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). However, these tools, in the context of pediatric head injury, have yet to be validated due to a paucity of pediatric head response data. The goal of this study is to investigate the response and injury tolerance of the pediatric head to impact. Twelve pediatric heads were impacted in a series of drop tests. The heads were dropped onto five impact locations (forehead, occiput, vertex and right and left parietal) from drop heights of 15 and 30\u202fcm. The head could freely fall without rotation onto a flat 19\u202fmm thick platen. The impact force was measured using a 3-axis piezoelectric load cell attached to the platen. Age and drop height were found to be significant factors in the impact response of the pediatric head. The head acceleration (14%-15\u202fcm; 103-30\u202fcm), Head Injury Criterion (HIC) (253%-15\u202fcm; 154%-30\u202fcm) and impact stiffness (5800%-15\u202fcm; 3755%-30\u202fcm) when averaged across all impact locations increased with age from 33\u202fweeks gestation to 16\u202fyears, while the pulse duration (66%-15\u202fcm; 53%-30\u202fcm) decreased with age. Increases in head acceleration, HIC and impact stiffness were also observed with increased drop height, while pulse duration decreased with increased drop height. One important observation was that three of the four cadaveric heads between the ages of 5-months and 22-months sustained fractures from the 15\u202fcm and 30\u202fcm drop heights. The 5-month-old sustained a right parietal linear fracture while the 11- and 22-month-old sustained diastatic linear fractures.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2019-07-31", "authors": ["Andre MatthewLoyd", "Roger WNightingale", "Jason FLuck", "Cameron 'Dale'Bass", "Hattie CCutcliffe", "Barry SMyers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.06.027"}

Almost all of components of the device were made of polymer for light weight and for acoustic impedance matching to the middle ear system. Several frequencies can be analyzed simultaneously and several measures can be taken by time. The results showed that the device can record normal and reconstructed ossicular chain vibration in response to an acoustic stimulation, with similar results to those achieved by laser Doppler vibrometer. This light, handheld and low-cost device allows fast, easy and safe assessments of normal ossicular chain mobility and ossicular chain reconstruction efficiency. Primary pre-clinical trial showed very promising performance of the device that could be used to qualitatively control ossiculoplasty during real-time surgical procedure. Clinical assessments will be done to further evaluate the real-life performance of the device.", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "date": "2019-07-29", "authors": ["Van SonNguyen", "DidierRouxel", "BriceVincent", "Jo\u00eblDucourneau", "C\u00e9cileParietti-Winkler"], "doi": "10.1007/s10877-019-00364-2"}
{"title": "Wirelessly Powered Signal Regeneration to Improve the Remote Detectability of an Inductive Pressure Sensor.", "abstract": "Chronic pressure monitoring by wireless and batteryless sensors are desirable for maintaining proper function of biomedical implants. Compared to capacitive, piezoelectric, and piezoresistive sensors, inductive sensors are less susceptible to capacitance fluctuation in the environment, and they can convert loading pressure into inductance changes for wireless detection as resonance frequency shifts. However, inductive sensors normally require the use of ferromagnetic materials for frequency tuning; their frequency responses are harder to detect over larger distance separations. Without using ferromagnetic materials, we will utilize two coaxially coupled resonators whose mutual inductance (and thus resonance frequency) is modulated by the thickness of an elastic substrate that can deform under pressure loading. By modifying one of the coupled resonators into a parametric resonator that contains nonlinear capacitors and an extra conductor across its virtual grounds, the sensor can utilize wireless pumping power to enlarge backscattered signals whose peak response frequency is linearly correlated with the loading pressure. This linear relation is observable beyond the near-field region, even though the distance separation between the sensor and the measurement loop is ten-fold the sensor's circuit dimension. This novel concept of wirelessly powered signal regeneration will improve the remote detectability and operation flexibility of various physiological sensors.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2019-07-29", "authors": ["WeiQian", "ChunqiQian"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2930651"}

{"title": "Investigation of Weigh-in-Motion Measurement Accuracy on the Basis of Steering Axle Load Spectra.", "abstract": "Weigh-in-motion systems are installed in pavements or on bridges to identify and reduce the number of overloaded vehicles and minimise their adverse effect on road infrastructure. Moreover, the collected traffic data are used to obtain axle load characteristics, which are very useful in road infrastructure design. Practical application of data from weigh-in-motion has become more common recently, which calls for adequate attention to data quality. This issue is addressed in the presented paper. The aim of the article is to investigate the accuracy of 77 operative weigh-in-motion stations by analysing steering axle load spectra. The proposed methodology and analysis enabled the identification of scale and source of errors that occur in measurements delivered from weigh-in-motion systems. For this purpose, selected factors were investigated, including the type of axle load sensor, air temperature and vehicle speed. The results of the analysis indicated the obvious effect of the axle load sensor type on the measurement results. It was noted that systematic error increases during winter, causing underestimation of axle loads by 5% to 10% for quartz piezoelectric and bending beam load sensors, respectively. A deterioration of system accuracy is also visible when vehicle speed decreases to 30 km/h. For 25% to 35% of cases, depending on the type of sensor, random error increases for lower speeds, while it remains at a constant level at higher speeds. The analysis also delivered a standard steering axle load distribution, which can have practical meaning in the improvement of weigh-in-motion accuracy and traffic data quality.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-07-28", "authors": ["DawidRys"], "doi": "10.3390/s19153272\n10.1080/10298436.2018.1435876\n10.1080/10298436.2015.1019493\n10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000571\n10.1515/pomr-2017-0016\n10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.214\n10.1016/j.trpro.2016.11.042\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2005)131:2(83)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2007)133:8(469)\n10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000801\n10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000077\n10.3141/2037-10\n10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.272\n10.1080/10298436.2016.1240562\n10.3390/s19092027\n10.3390/s18093044\n10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000335\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2007)133:1(1)\n10.2478/v10178-010-0028-2\n10.1016/j.trc.2013.08.012\n10.1016/j.trc.2012.01.010\n10.3390/s16122143\n10.3390/s17092053\n10.3141/1769-11\n10.1080/15472450.2016.1220306\n10.3141/2121-15\n10.1051/matecconf/201926205010\n10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.342"}

{"title": "Valley Acoustoelectric Effect.", "abstract": "We report on the novel valley acoustoelectric effect, which can arise in a 2D material, like a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer, residing on a piezoelectric substrate. The essence of this effect lies in the emergence of a drag electric current (and a spin current) due to a propagating surface acoustic wave. This current consists of three contributions, one independent of the valley index and proportional to the acoustic wave vector, the other arising due to the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion, and the third one is due to the Berry phase, which Bloch electrons acquire traveling along the crystal. As a result, there appear components of the current orthogonal to the acoustic wave vector. Further, we build an angular pattern, encompassing nontrivial topological properties of the acoustoelectric current, and suggest a way to run and measure the conventional diffusive, warping, and acoustoelectric valley Hall currents independently. We develop a theory, which opens a way to manipulate valley transport by acoustic methods, expanding the applicability of valleytronic effects on acoustoelectronic devices.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2019-07-28", "authors": ["A VKalameitsev", "V MKovalev", "I GSavenko"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.256801"}

An effective interface debonding defect detection approach for CFSTs is critical. In this paper, an active interface debonding detection approach using surface wave measurement with a piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch as sensor mounted on the outer surface of the CFST member excited with a PZT actuator mounted on the identical surface is proposed in order to avoid embedding PZT-based smart aggregates (SAs) in concrete core. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach and to investigate the effect of interface debonding defect on the surface wave measurement, two rectangular CFST specimens with different degrees of interface debonding defects on three internal surfaces are designed and experimentally studied. Surface stress waves excited by the PZT actuator and propagating along the steel tube of the specimens are measured by the PZT sensors with a pitch and catch pattern. Results show that the surface-mounted PZT sensor measurement is sensitive to the existence of interface debonding defect and the interface debonding defect leads to the increase in the voltage amplitude of surface wave measurement.

The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have a well defined energy, but are quantum superpositions of equally spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different energy eigenstates using resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency.

At the present study, electrospinning was applied to fabricate polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and PVDF-polyaniline (PANI) composite scaffolds. In addition, extremely low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) was applied for treating the stem cells derived from dental pulp (DPSCs) when cultured on the nanofibrous scaffolds. Osteoinductive property of the fabricated PVDF, PVDF-PANI scaffold at the presence and absence of the PEMF was investigated by evaluating the common osteogenic differentiation markers in seeded-DPSCs on the scaffold. Results demonstrated that cell attachment, protein adsorption and cells viability were increased when PEMF was applied. In addition, ALP activity, calcium content, osteogenic genes and protein evaluations confirmed that PEMF could significantly increase osteoinductivity of the PVDF while composite with PANI. According to the results, the use of polymers with piezoelectricity and conductivity features plus PEMF exposure has a promising potential to improve the current treatment methods in bone and mandibular defects.", "journal": "Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology", "date": "2019-07-25", "authors": ["AliMirzaei", "EhsanSaburi", "Seyed EhsanEnderami", "MatinehBarati Bagherabad", "Seyedeh ElnazEnderami", "MahmoodChokami", "AbbasShapouri Moghadam", "RezaSalarinia", "AbdolrezaArdeshirylajimi", "VahidMansouri", "FatemehSoleimanifar"], "doi": "10.1080/21691401.2019.1645154"}

{"title": "Lights Out! Nano-Scale Topography Imaging of Sample Surface in Opaque Liquid Environments with Coated Active Cantilever Probes.", "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy is a powerful topography imaging method used widely in nanoscale metrology and manipulation. A conventional Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) utilizes an optical lever system typically composed of a laser source, lenses and a four quadrant photodetector to amplify and measure the deflection of the cantilever probe. This optical method for deflection sensing limits the capability of AFM to obtaining images in transparent environments only. In addition, tapping mode imaging in liquid environments with transparent sample chamber can be difficult for laser-probe alignment due to multiple different refraction indices of materials. Spurious structure resonance can be excited from piezo actuator excitation. Photothermal actuation resolves the resonance confusion but makes optical setup more complicated. In this paper, we present the design and fabrication method of coated active scanning probes with piezoresistive deflection sensing, thermomechanical actuation and thin photoresist polymer surface coating. The newly developed probes are capable of conducting topography imaging in opaque liquids without the need of an optical system. The selected coating can withstand harsh chemical environments with high acidity (e.g., 35% sulfuric acid). The probes are operated in various opaque liquid environments with a custom designed AFM system to demonstrate the imaging performance.

Our design aims to fill a void in sample manipulation between two classes of widely used instruments: nano-scale and macro-scale robotic manipulators. The key component is a uniquely designed cam flexure system, which linearly translates the bending of a piezoelectric bimorph actuator into angular displacement. The 3D printing made it possible to realize the fabrication of the cam with a specifically calculated curve, which would otherwise be costly using conventional milling techniques. We first characterized 3D printed nylon by studying sets of simple cantilevers, which provided fundamental characteristics that could be used for further designs. The finite element method analysis based on the obtained material data matched well with the experimental data. The tweezers showed angular displacement from 0\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 linearly to the deflection of the piezo actuator (0-1.74 mm) with the linearity error of 0.1\u00b0. Resonant frequency of the system with/without working tweezer tips was discovered as 101 Hz and 127 Hz, respectively.

{"title": "Electronic Skin to Feel \"Pain\": Detecting \"Prick\" and \"Hot\" Pain Sensations.", "abstract": "An artificial tactile system has attracted tremendous interest and intensive study, since it can be applied as a new functional interface between humans and electronic devices. Unfortunately, most previous works focused on improving the sensitivity of sensors. However, humans also respond to psychological feelings for sensations such as pain, softness, or roughness, which are important factors for interacting with others and objects. Here, we present an electronic skin concept that generates a \"pain\" warning signal, specifically, to sharp \"prick\" and \"hot\" sensations. To simplify the sensor structure for these two feelings, a single-body tactile sensor design is proposed. By exploiting \"hot\" feeling based on the Seebeck effect instead of the pyroelectric property, it is possible to distinguish points registering a \"hot\" feeling from those generating a \"prick\" feeling, which is based on the piezoelectric effect. The control of free carrier concentration in nanowire induced the appropriate level of Seebeck current, which enabled the sensor system to be more reliable. The first derivatives of the piezo and Seebeck output signals are the key factors for the signal processing of the \"pain\" feeling. The main idea can be applied to mimic other psychological tactile feelings.", "journal": "Soft robotics", "date": "2019-07-25", "authors": ["MinkyungSim", "Kyung HwaLee", "Kwon SikShin", "Jeong HeeShin", "Ji-WoongChoi", "HongsooChoi", "CheilMoon", "Hyun SikKim", "YuljaeCho", "Seung NamCha", "Jae EunJung", "Jung InnSohn", "Jae EunJang"], "doi": "10.1089/soro.2018.0049"}

{"title": "A self-powered delivery substrate boosts active enzyme delivery in response to human movements.", "abstract": "Stimulated drug releases in response to human movements are highly appealing in medical therapy and various daily uses. However, the design of a mechanically responsive substrate that presents high delivery capacities and can also preserve the activities of sensitive molecules such as enzymes is still challenging. Taking advantage of the recent development in effective piezoelectric flexible films and in molecular delivery devices, we propose a composite delivery substrate that preserves enzyme activities and enhances molecular delivery in response to human movements such as finger presses or massages. The substrate is achieved by combining two parts, which are the energy converting unit and the molecular loading and releasing unit. The energy converting unit is a piezoelectric-dielectric flexible composite film that produces enhanced electricity and preserves the electricity longer compared to a pure piezoelectric polymer. The molecular delivery unit is a layer-by-layer multilayer containing mesoporous silica particles that are assembled at pH 9 but used in neutral solutions. The releases of molecules including small molecules, peptides, and proteins are all accelerated in response to finger presses irrespective of the signs or densities of their charges. More importantly, the enzyme CAT preserves its activity after release from the composite substrates, meaning that the CAT-loaded (PAH/MS)n(PAH/DAS)n@rGO-TFB/PVDF-HFP composite substrate holds promise as a self-powered soothing pad that effectively removes residue H2O2.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-07-25", "authors": ["YiZhang", "CongyangTong", "ZequnMa", "LimeiLu", "HanFu", "ShaofengPan", "WangshuTong", "XiangmingLi", "YiheZhang", "QiAn"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr04673a"}

{"title": "PVDF/Graphene Composite Nanoporous Membranes for Vanadium Flow Batteries.", "abstract": "The development of chemically stable and high conductive membranes is one of the most important issues to improve the performance of vanadium flow batteries (VFBs). Herein, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/graphene composite nanoporous membranes were easily fabricated by manipulating crystallization processes. The graphene was used to enhance membrane selectivity and conductivity. In the nanoscale channels of the membranes, the graphene nanosheets reduced the apertures among the crystal grains, thus restraining vanadium ions crossover due to the size exclusion effect. Moreover, the oxygen groups on the graphene improved the surface hydrophilicity and formed hydrogen bonds with the PVDF polymer chains, which facilitated the proton transport. The composite membranes, with a 0.15 wt % graphene loading, showed a selectivity of 38.2 and conductivity of 37.1 mS/cm.

{"title": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation on Mechanical and Piezoelectric Properties of Boron Nitride Honeycomb Structures.", "abstract": "Boron nitride honeycomb structure is a new three-dimensional material similar to carbon honeycomb, which has attracted a great deal of attention due to its special structure and properties. In this paper, the tensile mechanical properties of boron nitride honeycomb structures in the zigzag, armchair and axial directions are studied at room temperature by using molecular dynamics simulations. Effects of temperature and strain rate on mechanical properties are also discussed. According to the observed tensile mechanical properties, the piezoelectric effect in the zigzag direction was analyzed for boron nitride honeycomb structures. The obtained results showed that the failure strains of boron nitride honeycomb structures under tensile loading were up to 0.83, 0.78 and 0.55 in the armchair, zigzag and axial directions, respectively, at room temperature. These findings indicated that boron nitride honeycomb structures have excellent ductility at room temperature. Moreover, temperature had a significant effect on the mechanical and tensile mechanical properties of boron nitride honeycomb structures, which can be improved by lowering the temperature within a certain range. In addition, strain rate affected the maximum tensile strength and failure strain of boron nitride honeycomb structures. Furthermore, due to the unique polarization of boron nitride honeycomb structures, they possessed an excellent piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric coefficient e obtained from molecular dynamics was 0.702 &nbsp; C / m 2 , which was lower than that of the monolayer boron nitride honeycomb structures, e = 0.79 &nbsp; C / m 2 .

However, the efficiency of sperm cell isolation can be compromised in samples containing an extremely large number of epithelial cells. When highly concentrated samples are lysed, changes to the physicochemical nature of the medium surrounding the cells impacts the acoustic frequency needed for optimal trapping. Previous work has demonstrated successful, automated adjustment of acoustic frequency to account for changes in temperature and buffer properties in various samples. Here we show that, during acoustic trapping, real-time monitoring of voltage measurements across the piezoelectric transducer correlates with sample-dependent changes in the medium. This is achieved with a wideband peak detector circuit, which identifies the resonant frequency with minimal disruption to the applied voltage.

In this study, we identified that filterable bacteria enriched from a surface water are members of the Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetae, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Filterable bacteria displayed superior filterability during the entire bacterial growth phase, especially at the exponential phase. Maximal passage percentages were comparable at different cell densities, and achieved earlier at high cell density. Furthermore, filter retention for the investigated bacteria is independent of liquid temperature. However, cultivation temperature could affect the growth of some specific filterable bacteria and lead to variability in the passage percentage. Additionally, membrane materials, pore size and filtering flux greatly affected the passage of filterable bacteria.

Mechanical stimulation plays a key role in prostate cancer development. Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component\u00a01 (Piezo1), which functions as a cell sensor and transducer of mechanical stimuli, may have a crucial role in the development of prostate cancer. In the present study, the expression of the Piezo1 channel was demonstrated to be significantly elevated in prostate cancer cell lines and in human prostate malignant tumor tissues. Downregulation of Piezo1 significantly suppressed the viability, proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in\u00a0vitro, and inhibited prostate tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. The activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway or acceleration of cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S\u00a0phase may downstream consequences of Piezo\u00a01 signal pathway activation.

{"title": "Pneumatic actuator and flexible piezoelectric sensor for soft virtual reality glove system.", "abstract": "The desire to directly touch and experience virtual objects led to the development of a tactile feedback device. In this paper, a novel soft pneumatic actuator for providing tactile feedback is proposed and demonstrated. The suggested pneumatic actuator does not use an external air compressor but it is operated by internal air pressure generated by an electrostatic force. By using the actuator, we designed a glove to interact with virtual reality. The finger motions are detected by attached flexible piezoelectric sensors and transmitted to a virtual space through Bluetooth for interconnecting with a virtual hand. When the virtual finger touches the virtual object, the actuators are activated and give the tactile feedback to the real fingertip. The glove is made of silicone rubber material and integrated with the sensors and actuators such that users can wear them conveniently with light weight.

This copolymer was used as the hydrophilic additive in preparation of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes via immersion-precipitation process. Surface characteristics of the membranes were confirmed by contact angle measurements, zeta potential, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. During filtration experiments, the modified membranes showed better permeation and antifouling performances compared to PVDF membranes with bovine serum albumin, sodium alginate and yeast. After hydraulic stirring cleaning with deionized water, water flux recovery and rejection ratio of the modified membranes were higher than those of pristine PVDF membrane, and the flux recovery ratio was maximized at 94.29%. It was suggested that PPG-co-PEG-co-PPG copolymer was anchored in the PVDF membrane through the two hydrophobic ends of PPG blocks, while the hydrophilic intermediate of the PEG block segregated onto the membrane or pore surface during the membrane preparation process.

In the MXene-bonded Si@C film, MXene constructed a three-dimensional conductive framework in which Si@C nanocomposites were embedded. Its loose and porous structure provided much space to buffer the large volume expansion of Si@C nanoparticles and thus led to significantly superior cycle stability compared with conventional CMC- and PVDF-bonded Si@C electrodes. Moreover, the porous structure and the metallically conductive MXene offered fast ion transport and outstanding conductivity of the MXene-bonded Si@C film, which were favorable for its rate performance.

{"title": "Energy harvesting based routing protocol for underwater sensor networks.", "abstract": "Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are ad-hoc networks which are deployed at rivers, seas and oceans to explore and monitor the phenomena such as pollution control, seismic activities and petroleum mining etc. The sensor nodes of UWSNs have limited charging capabilities. UWSNs networks are generally operated under two deployment mechanisms i.e localization and non-localization based. However, in both the mechanisms, balanced energy utilization is a challenging issue. Inefficient usage of energy significantly affects stability period, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, path loss and throughput of a network. To efficiently utilize and harvest energy, this paper present a novel scheme called EH-ARCUN (Energy Harvesting Analytical approach towards Reliability with Cooperation for UWSNs) based on cooperation with energy harvesting. The scheme employs Amplify-and-Forward (AF) technique at relay nodes for data forwarding and Fixed Combining Ratio (FCR) technique at destination node to select accurate signal. The proposed technique selects relay nodes among its neighbor nodes based on harvested energy level. Most cooperation-based UWSN routing techniques do not exhibit energy harvesting mechanism at the relay nodes. EH-ARCUN deploys piezoelectric energy harvesting at relay nodes to improve the working capabilities of sensors in UWSNs. The proposed scheme is an extension of our previously implemented routing scheme called ARCUN for UWSNs. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared with ARCUN and RACE (Reliability and Adaptive Cooperation for efficient Underwater sensor Networks) schemes in term of stability period, packet delivery ratio, network throughput and path loss. Extensive simulation results show that EH-ARCUN performs better than both previous schemes in terms of the considered parameters.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2019-07-18", "authors": ["AdilKhan", "MukhtajKhan", "SheerazAhmed", "Mohd AmiruddinAbd Rahman", "MushtaqKhan"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0219459\n10.1002/dac.3350\n10.1109/TIE.2016.2619319\n10.1007/s11276-015-1150-6\n10.1109/JSEN.2012.2210401\n10.1109/TVT.2017.2687622\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2688240\n10.3390/s17030629\n10.1007/s12243-017-0560-0\n10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.042\n10.3390/s16030297\n10.1016/j.jnca.2017.01.013\n10.1155/2017/7954175\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.05.027\n10.3390/s90906626\n10.3390/s16040487\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2532389\n10.1109/JSEN.2016.2530808\n10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.03.035\n10.1142/S0218396X01000401\n10.3390/s18072300"}

{"title": "Fabrication of polyvinylidene fluoride-derived porous carbon heterostructure with inserted carbon nanotube via phase-inversion coupled with annealing for capacitive deionization application.", "abstract": "As a promising desalination technology, capacitive deionization (CDI) has great potential to guarantee freshwater supply. It is urgently needed to explore novel electrode materials with excellent desalination performance. Herein, the PVDF-derived porous carbon heterostructure with inserted carbon nanotube (PPC/CNT) was prepared via phase-inversion coupled with annealing strategy and applied as electrode material for CDI desalination. The resultant PPC/CNT possesses the combined structural advantages of PPC and CNT, such as high specific surface, mesoporous structure and improved conductivity. By virtue of these remarkable properties, PPC/CNT exhibites an excellent electrosorption capacity of 15.1\u202fmg/g in 500\u202fmg/L NaCl, while that of PPC electrode is 10.3\u202fmg/g. Specially, the charge efficiency of PPC/CNT electrode is 1.39 times higher as compared to PPC, which is largely responsible for the improvement of electrosorption capacity. Besides, PPC/CNT electrode demonstrated good cycle stability over 10 electrosorption-desorption cycles. Thus, PPC/CNT electrode presents promising prospects as CDI electrode for water desalination.

{"title": "A comparison between LP(GMA) and CLP(GMA) polymer composites as an immobilization matrix for biosensing applications: A model immunosensor for IL 1\u03b1.", "abstract": "A comparative study was made by using two matrices (Linear poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (GMA) polymer (LP(GMA)) and carbon black-polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-LP(GMA) composite CLP(GMA)) as immobilization platforms for anti-IL 1\u03b1 antibody on the development of impedimetric immunosensor for IL 1\u03b1 biomarker determination. These materials were spin coated onto the clean ITO electrode surface separately and used for IL 1\u03b1 immunosensor fabrication. Carbon black is utilized as a conductive material and has been employed over the last few decades for electrochemical biosensors development. The using of CLP(GMA) composite as an interface material shows fast electron transfer, when compared to LP(GMA) modified ITO electrode. This comparative study investigated the efficacy of carbon black for impedimetric biosensing. Anti-IL 1\u03b1 antibodies were utilized as bioreceptors and bound to epoxy groups of GMA polymer. For electrochemical characterizations, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry and Single Frequency Impedance methods were employed. Furthermore, to follow the antibody attachment on the modified ITO substrates, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Raman spectral techniques were utilized. The morphological characterizations of immunosensor construction stages were carried out by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy analyses. The sensitive and label-free technique of EIS was used for quantification of IL 1\u03b1 concentration. Under optimum experimental conditions, the immunosensor had a good linear relationship between impedance values and the IL 1\u03b1 concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 2\u202fpg/mL and from 0.01 to 3\u202fpg/mL for LP(GMA) and CLP(GMA) modified ITO electrodes, respectively. The results confirmed that CLP(GMA) used in the preparation of the immunosensor illustrated improvements in immunosensor performance, comparing to the LP(GMA) modified immunosensor. Additionally, the immunosensor was successfully applied to evaluate human serum and saliva samples. The obtained results from these samples illustrated the feasibility of the immunosensor for clinical diagnosis in complex biological samples.

{"title": "Chronic unpredictable stress influenced the behavioral but not the neurodegenerative impact of paraquat.", "abstract": "The impact of psychological stressors on the progression of motor and non-motor disturbances observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) has received little attention. Given that PD likely results from many different environmental \"hits\", we were interested in whether a chronic unpredictable stressor regimen would act additively or possibly even synergistically to augment the impact of the toxicant, paraquat, which has previously been linked to PD. Our findings support the contention that paraquat itself acted as a systemic stressor, with the pesticide increasing plasma corticosterone, as well as altering glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the hippocampus. Furthermore, stressed mice that also received paraquat displayed synergistic motor coordination impairment on a rotarod test and augmented signs of anhedonia (sucrose preference test). The individual stressor and paraquat treatments also caused a range of non-motor (e.g. open field, Y and plus mazes) deficits, but there were no signs of an interaction (neither additive nor synergistic) between the insults. Similarly, paraquat caused the expected loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons and microglial activation, but this effect was not further influenced by the chronic stressor. Taken together, these results indicate that paraquat has many effects comparable to that of a more traditional stressor and that at least some behavioral measures (i.e. sucrose preference and rotarod) are augmented by the combined pesticide and stress treatments. Thus, although psychological stressors might not necessarily increase the neurodegenerative effects of the toxicant exposure, they may promote co-morbid behaviors pathology.", "journal": "Neurobiology of stress", "date": "2019-07-16", "authors": ["ChrisRudyk", "ZachDwyer", "JessicaMcNeill", "NatalinaSalmaso", "KyleFarmer", "NatalieProwse", "ShawnHayley"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ynstr.2019.100179\n10.1016/j.etap.2016.10.008\n10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.01.004\n10.1186/1742-2094-9-86\n10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00175\n10.1016/j.nbd.2012.06.025\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2004.02.007\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.01.008\n10.1016/j.neuro.2010.02.006\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.06.034\n10.1186/1750-1326-7-49\n10.1002/syn.20456\n10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.06.016\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.09.035\n10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10069-2\n10.1016/S0169-328X(98)00040-0\n10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.046\n10.1371/journal.pone.0146671\n10.1016/j.bbi.2009.12.001\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06371.x\n10.1016/j.neulet.2011.07.041\n10.3389/fncel.2014.00391\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.02.016\n10.1016/j.nbd.2011.02.011\n10.1074/jbc.C100560200\n10.1016/j.nlm.2011.02.016\n10.1016/j.taap.2004.04.019\n10.1016/j.nbd.2011.12.040\n10.1186/1742-2094-8-163\n10.1289/ehp.1307970\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.05.039\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1569-07.2007\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2008.11.003\n10.1073/pnas.1115141108\n10.1007/s40572-016-0083-2\n10.1111/ene.12019\n10.1016/j.ynstr.2015.09.001\n10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.02.026\n10.1038/npp.2010.114\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185510\n10.1016/S0031-9384(02)00939-3\n10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06177.x\n10.1001/archneurol.2009.195\n10.1007/s10654-011-9574-5\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.654\n10.1016/j.ntt.2011.02.012"}

However, this noise could be utilized in producing energy especially in dense urban areas. Sound as a form of mechanical energy, it can be converted to electric energy through many approaches including heating, by using the diaphragm and through using piezoelectric materials. This research aims at utilizing noise through using piezoelectric materials as an approach of conversion to produce green sustainable electric energy that can be used to decrease the energy consumption from non-renewable sources and utilizing this energy in street lighting. The study was carried in three bus stations in Alexandria by having measurements during weekdays and weekends in order to study the noise produced in the selected stations and the amount of electric energy that could be produced and utilized in street lighting. The noise level index LDEN was calculated for each of the three selected locations. The equivalent noise level values were always exceeding the limits through the day, evening and night. At daytime they ranged between 75-85 dB which is higher that the permissible limit by 10-20 dB, at evening they ranged from 80-85 dB which is also higher than the permissible limit with 20-25 dB and at the night they ranged from 75-80 dB which is higher by 20-25 dB than the permissible limit. The research concluded that utilizing noise using the piezoelectric material is successful. The electric energy produced from an area of 1.45 m2 containing 690 piezoelectric QB220-503YB transducers at each of the selected stations was about 0.024 watt hr. This amount of electric energy is too small to be used in an application.

The degree of improvement is determined by a numerical simulation and the dual design-the design with the most promise-is experimentally realized. Laser Vibrometry measured the generated wave field, confirming the results from the simulation. The new designs can generate an almost pure SH0 wave. The dual design has a very strong directivity that is useful for several guided-wave-based SHM applications.

Traditional technologies for the Al foil and cathode materials separation have the disadvantages of the use of corrosive acid/alkali, release of HF hazards, and environment and healthy risks of the toxicity reagent. In this study, a low-toxicity, high-efficiency, and low-cost deep eutectic solvent (DES), choline chloride-glycerol, was synthesized and applied to solving the separation dilemma of Al foil and cathode materials in spent LIBs. The experimental results show that separation of the Al foil and cathode materials can be achieved under optimal conditions designed by the response surface method: heating temperature 190\u202f\u2103, choline chloride: glycerol molar ratio 2.3:1, and heating time 15.0\u202fmin; the peeling percentage of cathode material can reach 99.86\u202fwt%.

In order to enrich the tactile sense of haptic devices under simple control, a piezoelectric haptic feedback device is proposed. The piezoelectric tactile feedback device can realize tactile changes in different excitation voltage amplitudes, different excitation frequencies, and different directions through the ciliary body structure. The principle of the anisotropic vibration of the ciliary body structure was analyzed here, and a tactile model was established. The equivalent friction coefficient under full-coverage and local-coverage of the skin of the touch beam was deduced and solved. The effect of system parameters on the friction coefficient was analyzed. The results showed that in the full-coverage, the tactile effect is mainly affected by the proportion of the same directional ciliary bodies and the excitation frequency. The larger the proportion of the same direction ciliary body is, the smaller the coefficient of friction is. The larger the excitation frequency is, the greater the coefficient of friction is. In the local-coverage, the tactile effect is mainly affected by the touch position and voltage amplitude. When changing the touch pressure, it has a certain effect on the change of touch, but it is relatively weak. The experiment on the sliding friction of a cantilever touch beam and the experiment of human factor were conducted. The experimental results of the sliding friction experiment are basically consistent with the theoretical calculations.

Voltage-modulated atomic force microscopy (VM-AFM) has become a mainstay characterization tool for investigating these materials due to its ability to locally probe electromechanically responsive materials with spatial resolution from micrometers to nanometers. However, with the wide popularity of VM-AFM techniques such as piezoresponse force microscopy and electrochemical strain microscopy there has been a rise in reports of nanoscale electromechanical functionality, including hysteresis, in materials that should be incapable of exhibiting piezo- or ferroelectricity. Explanations for the origins of unexpected nanoscale phenomena have included new material properties, surface-mediated polarization changes, and/or spatially resolved behavior that is not present in bulk measurements.

We demonstrate that TS plays an important role in determining the structure, morphology and magnetic properties of the carbonaceous matrix, the graphite layer and the Co nanoparticles. Higher amounts of graphitic carbon and high saturation magnetization were observed for the Co-1000 sample than that for the Co-800 sample. We observed that the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding behavior of the PVDF-Co-1000 nanocomposite shows higher shielding effectiveness than that of the PVDF-Co-800 specimen. A more inhomogeneous dielectric medium in the PVDF-Co-1000 composite results in higher dielectric loss and impedance mismatch. A direct correlation between the shielding effectiveness with dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability is demonstrated.

However, the limited energy capacity and lifetime have made batteries the bottleneck in wearable technology. Thus, there have been growing efforts in the area of self-powered wearables that harvest ambient mechanical energy directly from surroundings. Herein, we demonstrate a woven triboelectric nanogenerator (WTENG) utilizing electrospun Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers and commercial nylon cloth to effectively harvest mechanical energy from human motion. The PVDF nanofibers were fabricated using a highly scalable multi-nozzle far-field centrifugal electrospinning protocol. We have also doped the PVDF nanofibers with small amounts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) to improve their triboelectric performance by facilitating the growth of crystalline \u03b2-phase with a high net dipole moment that results in enhanced surface charge density during contact electrification. The electrical output of the WTENG was characterized under a range of applied forces and frequencies. The WTENG can be triggered by various free-standing triboelectric layers and reaches a high output voltage and current of about 14 V and 0.7 \u00b5A, respectively, for the size dimensions 6 \u00d7 6 cm. To demonstrate the potential applications and feasibility for harvesting energy from human motion, we have integrated the WTENG into human clothing and as a floor mat (or potential energy generating shoe).

{"title": "Electrospun Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Based Fibrous Scaffolds with Piezoelectric Characteristics for Bone and Neural Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE) with excellent piezoelectricity and good biocompatibility are attractive materials for making functional scaffolds for bone and neural tissue engineering applications. Electrospun PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds can produce electrical charges during mechanical deformation, which can provide necessary stimulation for repairing bone defects and damaged nerve cells. As such, these fibrous mats promote the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of bone and neural cells on their surfaces. Furthermore, aligned PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) fibrous mats can enhance neurite growth along the fiber orientation direction. These beneficial effects derive from the formation of electroactive, polar \u03b2-phase having piezoelectric properties. Polar \u03b2-phase can be induced in the PVDF fibers as a result of the polymer jet stretching and electrical poling during electrospinning. Moreover, the incorporation of TrFE monomer into PVDF can stabilize the \u03b2-phase without mechanical stretching or electrical poling. The main drawbacks of electrospinning process for making piezoelectric PVDF-based scaffolds are their small pore sizes and the use of highly toxic organic solvents. The small pore sizes prevent the infiltration of bone and neuronal cells into the scaffolds, leading to the formation of a single cell layer on the scaffold surfaces. Accordingly, modified electrospinning methods such as melt-electrospinning and near-field electrospinning have been explored by the researchers to tackle this issue. This article reviews recent development strategies, achievements and major challenges of electrospun PVDF and P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Nanomaterials

Many strategies to improve the performance of linear vibration energy harvesters that collect energy over a limited bandwidth have been proposed. In this paper, a bi-stable two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) cut-out vibration energy harvester employing a pair of permanent magnets is designed through a proposed design methodology. Based on this methodology, the nonlinear harvesters can be optimally designed such that the bandwidth can be widened for a targeted output voltage. The proper selection of the harvester parameters as well as the gap distances between the tip and the fixed magnets are the bases of this methodology. The mathematical modeling of the proposed harvester and the formula for the potential energy between the tip and the fixed magnets are presented. Additionally, to enhance the performance of the bi-stable energy harvester (BEH), a quad-stable energy harvester (QEH) was configured by adding more fixed magnets. Experiments were performed to validate the numerical simulations and the results showed that, the simulation and experimental results are consistent. The results indicate that, the QEH covers a wider bandwidth than the BEH and based on a figure of merit the QEH shows the best performance among many harvesters presented in the literature.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-07-03", "authors": ["Abdelhameed A AZayed", "Samy F MAssal", "KimihikoNakano", "TsutomuKaizuka", "Ahmed M R FathEl-Bab"], "doi": "10.3390/s19132893\n10.1088/0960-1317/26/10/103001\n10.1016/S0924-4247(01)00569-6\n10.1177/1045389X08100042\n10.1016/j.enconman.2015.09.065\n10.1002/adfm.201801327\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.068\n10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2164975\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2331953\n10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2069574\n10.1016/j.mejo.2010.10.007\n10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094006\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/030\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.01.002\n10.1109/TUFFC.903\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2006.04.003\n10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.018\n10.1002/adfm.201601347\n10.3390/s19061444\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.12.008\n10.1177/1045389X12449920\n10.1177/1045389X12457254\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/102001\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.04.002\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.11.018\n10.1007/s11071-018-4417-5\n10.1051/epjap/2014140190\n10.1063/1.4942773\n10.3390/s18124472\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/12/125028\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.06.029\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.02.025\n10.1016/j.enconman.2017.07.005\n10.1177/1045389X14541494\n10.1109/JMEMS.2018.2875788\n10.3390/s18051492\n10.1155/1998/79537\n10.1177/1045389X12443016\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.077\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/4/045042\n10.1063/1.4861208\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.06.033\n10.1016/j.physd.2010.01.019\n10.1063/1.4982730\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.05.029\n10.1177/1045389X13498315"}
{"title": "Lightweight and Durable PVDF-SSPF Composites for Photovoltaics Backsheet Applications: Thermal, Optical and Technical Properties.", "abstract": "Photovoltaic module backsheets are characterized according to their thermal, optical, mechanical, and technical properties. This work introduces new fabricated backsheets for PV modules using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) reinforced with short sugar palm fiber (SSPF) composites. The preparation of composites undergoes multiple phases of fabrication. Thermal, optical, and technical investigations of their properties were conducted.

In this study, we successfully fabricated a PVDF-GO membrane via electrospinning technology and employed the functionalized nanofiber membrane to immobilize nZVI particles. The addition of GO into PVDF nanofibers can both increase the hydrophilicity to improve membrane flux and offer -COOH as a binder to immobilize nZVI particles.

The Instantaneous Frequency (IF) of the GSFM resembles the time/voltage characteristic of a Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) chirp waveform. Consequently, the GSFM possesses an Ambiguity Function (AF) that resembles a thumbtack shape. Practical sonar system design must consider two factors beyond the AF. The Spectral Efficiency (SE), defined as the ratio of energy in an operational frequency band to the total waveform energy, is another important metric for waveform design. The Peak-to-Average-Power Ratio (PAPR) quantifies how close the waveform is to constant amplitude. These measures predict a waveform's energy efficiency and ability to be accurately replicated on practical piezoelectric transducers, which have limits on both their bandwidth and maximum transmit power.

However, the pulsed characteristic makes it challenging to measure the thrust. This paper describes a thrust stand for directly measuring the pulsed thrust from small-thrust liquid-pulsed thrusters. The proposed stand is based on a unique piezoelectric dynamometer on which the thruster is mounted through a connecting frame. A thrust experiment is conducted by applying a trapezoidal pulsed force, similar to the thrust generated by small-thrust liquid-pulsed thrusters, to the thrust stand. The experimental results show that the thrust stand can quickly trace the input trapezoidal force signal, although its output waveform exhibits obvious oscillations. Based on the experimental frequency response data, a thrust stand transfer function model is constructed, and this model is used to analyze the dynamic response performance of the thrust stand. The step response and trapezoidal pulse response of the thrust stand are obtained, and the influence of the damping ratio on the dynamic performance of the thrust stand is analyzed. A damping compensation transfer function is established to improve the dynamic measurement performance of the thrust stand. Compensated results are obtained by using the raw output from the thrust stand as the input to the damping compensation transfer function. The damping compensation method does not change the natural frequencies of the thrust stand, does not need any additional filtering process, effectively eliminates the waveform oscillations of the thrust stand output, and ensures good consistency between the input and output signals.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-07-01", "authors": ["QinXing", "TengLi", "JunZhang", "Zong-JinRen"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5055893"}
{"title": "A single exposure to the tremorgenic mycotoxin lolitrem B inhibits voluntary motor activity and spatial orientation but not spatial learning or memory in mice.", "abstract": "The indole diterpenoid toxin lolitrem B is a tremorgenic agent found in the common grass species, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The toxin is produced by a symbiotic fungus Epichlo\u00eb festucae (var. lolii) and ingestion of infested grass with sufficient toxin levels causes a movement disorder in grazing herbivores known as 'ryegrass staggers'. Beside ataxia, lolitrem B intoxicated animals frequently show indicators of cognitive dysfunction or exhibition of erratic and unpredictable behaviours during handling. Evidence from field cases in livestock and controlled feeding studies in horses have indicated that intoxication with lolitrem B may affect higher cortical or subcortical functioning. In order to define the role of lolitrem B in voluntary motor control, spatial learning and memory under controlled conditions, mice were exposed to a known dose of purified lolitrem B toxin and tremor, coordination, voluntary motor activity and spatial learning and memory assessed. Motor activity, coordination and spatial memory were compared to tremor intensity using a novel quantitative piezo-electronic tremor analysis. Peak tremor was observed as frequencies between 15 and 25Hz compared to normal movement at approximately 1.4-10Hz. A single exposure to a known tremorgenic dose of lolitrem B (2\u202fmg/kg IP) induced measureable tremor for up to 72\u202fh in some animals. Initially, intoxication with lolitrem B significantly decreased voluntary movement. By 25\u202fh post exposure a return to normal voluntary movement was observed in this group, despite continuing evidence of tremor. This effect was not observed in animals exposed to the short-acting tremorgenic toxin paxilline. Lolitrem B intoxicated mice demonstrated a random search pattern and delayed latency to escape a 3\u202fh post intoxication, however by 27\u202fh post exposure latency to escape matched controls and mice had returned to normal searching behavior indicating normal spatial learning and memory. Together these data indicate that the tremor exhibited by lolitrem B intoxicated mice does not directly impair spatial learning and memory but that exposure does reduce voluntary motor activity in intoxicated animals.

Using high-shear mixing and doctor blade casting, we prepared free-standing composite films loaded with up to 5 wt % cellulose nanofibrils. For our processing conditions, all CNF/PVDF and TOCNF/PVDF films remain in the same crystalline phase as neat PVDF. In the as-prepared composites, the addition of CNFs on average increases crystallinity, whereas TOCNFs reduces it. Further, addition of CNFs and TOCNFs influences properties such as surface wettability, as well as thermal and mechanical behaviors of the composites. When compared to neat PVDF, the thermal stability of the composites is reduced. With regards to bulk mechanical properties, addition of CNFs or TOCNFs, generally reduces the tensile properties of the composites. However, a small increase (~18%) in the tensile modulus was observed for the 1 wt % TOCNF/PVDF composite. Surface mechanical properties, obtained from nanoindentation, show that the composites have enhanced performance. For the 5 wt % CNF/PVDF composite, the reduced modulus and hardness increased by ~52% and ~22%, whereas for the 3 wt % TOCNF/PVDF sample, the increase was ~23% and ~25% respectively.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-06-30", "authors": ["EftihiaBarnes", "Jennifer AJefcoat", "Erik MAlberts", "Mason AMcKechnie", "Hannah RPeel", "J PaigeBuchanan", "Charles AWeiss", "Kyle LKlaus", "L ChristopherMimun", "Christopher MWarner"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11071091\n10.1007/s10570-013-0007-3\n10.1007/s10570-013-9876-8\n10.1016/S0266-3538(02)00063-5\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2006.06.015\n10.1002/adma.200501851\n10.4067/S0718-221X2005000300002\n10.1038/nbt875\n10.1007/s11051-010-0008-1\n10.1039/c0cs00108b\n10.1021/bm200401p\n10.1021/am302624t\n10.1021/acsami.5b08317\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1063/1.122365\n10.1016/j.sna.2012.05.019\n10.1557/mrs2008.42\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0\n10.1016/S0376-7388(02)00325-3\n10.1038/nmat1269\n10.1002/adma.200602564\n10.1021/nl9040719\n10.1088/0957-0233/17/12/R01\n10.1088/0960-1317/17/7/007\n10.1002/adma.201200150\n10.1021/ma60077a029\n10.1021/ma50003a018\n10.1007/s10965-014-0434-3\n10.1007/s13391-013-3083-5\n10.1007/s10570-015-0634-y\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.10.068\n10.1016/j.cej.2013.10.032\n10.1002/app.29413\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.08.061\n10.3390/polym9020033\n10.1063/1.4870590\n10.1021/am500359f\n10.2478/s11534-011-0096-2\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.04.092\n10.1039/C8NJ01161C\n10.1177/004051755902901003\n10.1007/s10973-016-5364-3\n10.1021/am300852a\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.06.037\n10.1021/bm4001734\n10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.12.016\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.05.083\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.07.010\n10.1039/c3tc31774a\n10.1021/bm101255x\n10.1021/bm0703970\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.04.001\n10.1039/tf9444000546\n10.1021/jp204513w\n10.1021/ma011744f\n10.1021/acsami.5b04161\n10.1021/sc500792c\n10.1002/app.43594\n10.1021/jp3038768\n10.1021/ma801325p\n10.1021/bm900414t\n10.1021/jp4033723\n10.1039/C4RA06334A\n10.12691/jmpc-2-1-1\n10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2010.06.015\n10.1007/s10570-013-0073-6\n10.3390/polym11010117\n10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.05.076\n10.3390/polym11010153"}

The crystallization process, structure, composition, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of the nanofibers and nanofiber webs were investigated. Theoretical analysis and experimental results showed that the surface-induced heterogeneous nucleation resulted in the remarkable lower crystallization temperature for the KNN nanofibers with the {100} orientation of the perovskite phase in contrast to the bulk KNN gel and thus well-controlled chemical stoichiometry.

Considering the high efficiency of tissue engineering in repairing bone defects, in this study, we investigated the combined effect of nanofibrous scaffolds in combination with PRP on the osteogenic differentiation potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Electrospinning was used for fabricating nanofibrous scaffolds by polyvinylidene fluoride/collagen (PVDF/col) with and without PRP. After scaffold characterization, the osteoinductivity of the fabricated scaffolds was studied by culturing human iPSCs under osteogenic medium. The results showed that PRP has a considerable positive effect on the biocompatibility of the PVDF/col nanofibrous scaffold when examined by protein adsorption, cell attachment, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. In addition, the results obtained from alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content assays demonstrated that nanofibers have higher osteoinductivity while grown on PRP-incorporated PVDF/col nanofibers. These results were also confirmed while the osteogenic differentiation of the iPSCs was more investigated by evaluating the most important bone-related genes expression level. According to the results, it can be concluded that PVDF/col/PRP has much more osteoinductivity while compared with the PVDF/col, and it can be introduced as a promising bone bio-implant for use in bone tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2019-06-30", "authors": ["Mohammad FoadAbazari", "FatemehSoleimanifar", "MojdehAmini Faskhodi", "Reyhaneh NassiriMansour", "JavadAmini Mahabadi", "SolmazSadeghi", "HadiHassannia", "EhsanSaburi", "Seyed EhsanEnderami", "Mohammad MehdiKhani", "ShohrehZare Karizi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.29029"}

Here we report robust in-plane ferroelectricity in few-layer tin sulfide (SnS) 2D crystals that is coupled anisotropically to lattice strain. Specifically, the intrinsic polarization of SnS manifests as nanoripples along the armchair direction due to a converse piezoelectric effect. Most interestingly, such nanoripples show an odd-and-even effect in terms of its layer dependence, indicating that it is highly sensitive to changes in inversion symmetry. Ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in field-effect transistor devices fabricated on ultrathin SnS films, in which a stronger ferroelectric response is achieved at negative gate voltages.

{"title": "Footstep Energy Harvesting with the Magnetostrictive Fiber Integrated Shoes.", "abstract": "Wearable energy harvesting devices attract attention as the devices provide electrical power without inhibiting user mobility and independence. While the piezoelectric materials integrated shoes have been considered as wearable energy harvesting devices for a long time, they can lose their energy harvesting performance after being used several times due to their brittleness. In this study, we focused on Fe-Co magnetostrictive materials and fabricated Fe-Co magnetostrictive fiber integrated shoes. We revealed that Fe-Co magnetostrictive fiber integrated shoes are capable of generating 1.2 \u00b5J from 1000 steps of usual walking by the Villari (inverse magnetostrictive) effect. It seems that the output energy is dependent on user habit on ambulation, not on their weight. From both a mechanical and functional point of view, Fe-Co magnetostrictive fiber integrated shoes demonstrated stable energy harvesting performance after being used many times.

Furthermore, the Ni nanoparticles decorated on the surface of ZnO NRs enhanced the electrical conductivity of the ZnO NR anode, which enabled faster electronic and ionic transport at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode, resulting in improved electrochemical capacity.

Metal-elastomer nanocomposites are a promising approach, enabling high conductivity and stretchability derived from metallic conduction and percolation networks of metal nano/micro fillers. However, their practical application is still limited by their inferior cyclic stability and long-term durability. Here, we report on a highly durable nanofiber-reinforced metal-elastomer composite consisting of (i) metal fillers, (ii) an elastomeric binder matrix, and (iii) electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibers for enhancing both cyclic stability and conductivity. Embedded polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers enhance the toughness and suppress the crack growth by providing a fiber reinforcing effect. Furthermore, the conductivity of nanofiber-reinforced elastic conductor is four times greater than the pristine material because the silver-rich layer is self-assembled on the top surface by a filtering effect. As a result, a stretchable electrode made from nanofiber-reinforced elastic conductors and wrinkled structures has both excellent cyclic durability and high conductivity and is stretchable up to 800%.

Using well-characterized biomaterials of known stiffness and explanted animal tissue models, we first established experimental protocols for STFN measures on biological tissues, as well as optimized device design for high signal-to-noise ratio. Freshly excised patient thyroids with varying fibrotic and malignant potential revealed discrete variations in STFN based tissue stiffness/stiffness heterogeneity and correlated well with final histopathology.

In this work, (1 - x)(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 - x[NaSbO3 + Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5(Zr0.5Hf0.5)O3] lead-free ceramics with R-O-T ferroelectric phase coexistence were developed and the relationship between the phase structure and piezoelectricity was investigated in detail. As x increases, the transition temperature of the rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases (TR-O) increases, while the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition temperature (TO-T) decreases. When 0.04 \u2264 x \u2264 0.05, three ferroelectric phases (R-O-T) coexist near room temperature in the ceramics. Due to the highly consistent orientation of the ferroelectric dipole and the free energy flattening and a low energy barrier induced by the coexistence of three ferroelectric phases (R-O-T), excellent piezoelectric performances of d33 = 452 pC N-1, kp = 63% and \u03b5r = 4414 are achieved at x = 0.04.

{"title": "Aortic valve opening and closure: the clover dynamics.", "abstract": "Systolic aortic root expansion is reported to facilitate valve opening, but the precise dynamics remain unknown. A sonometric study with a high data sampling rate (200 to 800 Hz) was conducted in an acute ovine model to better understand the timing, mechanisms, and shape of aortic valve opening and closure.\nEighteen piezoelectric crystals were implanted in 8 sheep at each annular base, commissures, sinus of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, nodulus of Arantius, and ascending aorta (AA). Geometric changes were time related to pressures and flows.\nThe aortic root was hemodynamically divided into left ventricular (LV) and aortic compartments situated, respectively, below and above the leaflets. During isovolumetric contraction (IVC), aortic root expansion started in the LV compartment, most likely due to volume redistribution in the LV outflow tract below the leaflets. This expansion initiated leaflet separation prior to ejection (2.1%\u00b10.5% of total opening area). Aortic compartment expansion was delayed toward the end of IVC, likely related to volume redistribution above the leaflets due to accelerating aortic backflow toward the aortic valve and coronary flow reduction due to myocardial contraction. Maximum valve opening during the first third of ejection acquired a truncated cone shape [leaflet free edge area smaller than annular base area (-41.5%\u00b15.5%)]. The distal orifice became clover shaped because the leaflet free edge area is larger than the commissural area by 16.3%\u00b12.0%.\nAortic valve opening is initiated prior to ejection related to delicate balance between LV, aortic root, and coronary dynamics. It is clover shaped at maximum opening in systole.

Test solutions for MD experiments were permeate produced by staged AFMBR (SAF-MBR), permeate from single AFMBR and synthetic wastewater fed to both reactors. Increasing in feed temperature improved permeate flux through PVDF membrane, but it decreased total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency. Effect of chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations in feed solutions for DCMD on TN removal efficiency was almost negligible. However, the COD removal efficiency was lower at lower feed concentration in DCMD operation. At constant feed temperature, TN removal efficiency was improved by increasing a recirculation flow rate on PVDF membrane across DCMD system. Both organic and inorganic fouling were observed on PVDF membrane surface and pore matrix after conducting DCMD operation. The organic fouling on PVDF membrane consisted mainly of protein and fatty acids, supporting that the permeate produced by AFMBR should have potentials to foul the membrane applied in DCMD system as post-treatment.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2019-06-27", "authors": ["FidaTibi", "JingGuo", "RizwanAhmad", "MichaelLim", "MinseokKim", "JeonghwanKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.06.043"}
{"title": "Structure-guided examination of the mechanogating mechanism of PIEZO2.", "abstract": "Piezo channels are mechanically activated ion channels that confer mechanosensitivity to a variety of different cell types. Piezos oligomerize as propeller-shaped homotrimers that are thought to locally curve the membrane into spherical domes that project into the cell. While several studies have identified domains and amino acids that control important properties such as ion permeability and selectivity as well as inactivation kinetics and voltage sensitivity, only little is known about intraprotein interactions that govern mechanosensitivity-the most unique feature of PIEZOs. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis and patch-clamp recordings to investigate the mechanogating mechanism of PIEZO2. We demonstrate that charged amino acids at the interface between the beam domain-i.e., a long \u03b1-helix that protrudes from the intracellular side of the \"propeller\" blade toward the inner vestibule of the channel-and the C-terminal domain (CTD) as well as hydrophobic interactions between the highly conserved Y2807 of the CTD and pore-lining helices are required to ensure normal mechanosensitivity of PIEZO2. Moreover, single-channel recordings indicate that a previously unrecognized intrinsically disordered domain located adjacent to the beam acts as a cytosolic plug that limits ion permeation possibly by clogging the inner vestibule of both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2. Thus, we have identified several intraprotein domain interfaces that control the mechanical activation of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 and which might thus serve as promising targets for drugs that modulate the mechanosensitivity of Piezo channels.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2019-06-27", "authors": ["Francisco JTaberner", "VincenzoPrato", "IrinaSchaefer", "KatrinSchrenk-Siemens", "Paul AHeppenstall", "Stefan GLechner"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1905985116\n10.1111/febs.14711"}

{"title": "Temperature Effects on Electromechanical Response of Deposited Piezoelectric Sensors Used in Structural Health Monitoring of Aerospace Structures.", "abstract": "Turbomachine components used in aerospace and power plant applications preferably require continuous structural health monitoring at various temperatures. The structural health of pristine and damaged superalloy compressor blades of a gas turbine engine was monitored using real electro-mechanical impedance of deposited thick film piezoelectric transducers at 20 and 200 \u00b0C. IVIUM impedance analyzer was implemented in laboratory conditions for damage detection in superalloy blades, while a custom-architected frequency-domain transceiver circuit was used for semi-field circumstances. Recorded electromechanical impedance signals at 20 and 200 \u00b0C acquired from two piezoelectric wafer active sensors bonded to an aluminum plate, near and far from the damage, were initially utilized for accuracy and reliability verification of the transceiver at temperatures >20 \u00b0C. Damage formation in both the aluminum plate and blades showed a peak shift in the swept frequency along with an increase in the amplitude and number of impedance peaks. The thermal energy at 200 \u00b0C, on the other hand, enforces a further subsequent peak shift in the impedance signal to pristine and damaged parts such that the anti-resonance frequency keeps reducing as the temperature increases. The results obtained from the impedance signals of both piezoelectric wafers and piezo-films, revealed that increasing the temperature somewhat decreased the real impedance amplitude and the number of anti-resonance peaks, which is due to an increase in permittivity and capacitance of piezo-sensors. A trend is also presented for artificial intelligence training purposes to distinguish the effect of the temperature versus damage formation in sample turbine compressor blades.

{"title": "Inkjet Printing of Functional Electronic Memory Cells: A Step Forward to Green Electronics.", "abstract": "Nowadays, the environmental issues surrounding the production of electronics, from the perspectives of both the materials used and the manufacturing process, are of major concern. The usage, storage, disposal protocol and volume of waste material continue to increase the environmental footprint of our increasingly \"throw away society\". Almost ironically, society is increasingly involved in pollution prevention, resource consumption issues and post-consumer waste management. Clearly, a dichotomy between environmentally aware usage and consumerism exists. The current technology used to manufacture functional materials and electronic devices requires high temperatures for material deposition processes, which results in the generation of harmful chemicals and radiation. With such issues in mind, it is imperative to explore new electronic functional materials and new manufacturing pathways. Here, we explore the potential of additive layer manufacturing, inkjet printing technology which provides an innovative manufacturing pathway for functional materials (metal nanoparticles and polymers), and explore a fully printed two terminal electronic memory cell. In this work, inkjetable materials (silver (Ag) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)) were first printed by a piezoelectric Epson Stylus P50 inkjet printer as stand-alone layers, and secondly as part of a metal (Ag)/active layer (PEDOT:PSS)/metal (Ag) crossbar architecture. The quality of the individual multi-layers of the printed Ag and PEDOT:PSS was first evaluated via optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, an electrical characterisation of the printed memory elements was performed using an HP4140B picoammeter.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2019-06-27", "authors": ["IuliaSalaoru", "SalahMaswoud", "ShashiPaul"], "doi": "10.3390/mi10060417\n10.3390/coatings8080278\n10.1002/smll.201303000\n10.1002/admt.201800546\n10.1039/C4CC08749F\n10.1021/am303268k\n10.1039/C5RA08205F\n10.1016/j.egypro.2013.11.094\n10.1021/am201609w\n10.1021/ac3003243\n10.1002/adma.200902557\n10.1016/j.matpr.2015.08.018\n10.1109/84.982863\n10.2147/NSA.S68080\n10.1088/0957-4484/16/10/074\n10.1063/1.109552\n10.1039/C4FD00067F\n10.1088/1361-6463/aaaf5a\n10.1021/nn2044609\n10.1063/1.121783\n10.1002/1521-4095(20021203)14:23<1717::AID-ADMA1717>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1126/science.290.5499.2123\n10.1063/1.4978664\n10.1039/C5RA11058K\n10.1002/app.43572\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104502\n10.1039/C3NR05479A\n10.1108/03056120810918105\n10.1080/00084433.2017.1329190"}
{"title": "Modeling, Simulation, Experimentation, and Compensation of Temperature Effect in Impedance-Based SHM Systems Applied to Steel Pipes.", "abstract": "Pipelines have been widely used for the transportation of chemical products, mainly those related to the petroleum industry. Damage in such pipelines can produce leakage with unpredictable consequences to the environment. There are different structural health monitoring (SHM) systems such as Lamb wave, comparative vacuum, acoustic emission, etc. for monitoring such structures. However, those based on piezoelectric sensors and electromechanical impedance technique (EMI) measurements are simple and efficient, and have been applied in a wide range of structures, including pipes. A disadvantage of such technique is that temperature changes can lead to false diagnoses. To overcome this disadvantage, temperature variation compensation techniques are normally incorporated. Therefore, this work has developed a complete study applied to damage detection in pipelines, including an innovative technique for compensating the temperature effect in EMI-based SHM and the modeling of piezoceramics bonded to pipeline structures using finite elements. Experimental results were used to validate the model. Moreover, the compensation method was tested in two steel pipes-healthy and damaged-compensating the temperature effect ranging from -40 \u00b0C to +80 \u00b0C, with analysis on the frequency range from 5 kHz to 120 kHz. The simulated and experimental results showed that the studies effectively contribute to the SHM area, mainly to EMI-based techniques.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-06-27", "authors": ["Rothschild AAntunes", "Nicol\u00e1s ECortez", "B\u00e1rbara MGianesini", "JozueVieira Filho"], "doi": "10.3390/s19122802\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.05.064\n10.1177/1475921712461163\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1177/1475921710365269\n10.1177/1045389X14538532\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1002/eqe.72\n10.1177/1045389X04039914\n10.2507/IJSIMM15(3)1.338\n10.1088/1757-899X/392/6/062074\n10.3390/s18072106\n10.3390/s140101208\n10.1177/1045389X08088664\n10.1177/1045389X16657423\n10.1299/jsmea.42.249\n10.1177/1045389X11421814\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.2.283\n10.12989/sss.2018.22.1.057\n10.1002/stc.2173\n10.1106/H0EV-7PWM-QYHW-E7VF\n10.1177/1475921705049752\n10.3390/s19051107\n10.1177/1475921710388338\n10.1108/MMMS-03-2015-0015\n10.1121/1.410238\n10.1063/1.2560441\n10.1109/TIM.2009.2018693"}
{"title": "Experimental Study on Damage Detection in ECC-Concrete Composite Beams Using Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "The use of engineered cementitious composite (ECC) has attracted extensive attention in recent years because of the highly enhanced ductility owing to its unique strain-hardening behavior. In this paper, an electromechanical impedance-based technique is used to monitor the structural damage of RC beams strengthened with an ECC layer at the tensile zone. To achieve this purpose, three specimens are tested under bending loads to evaluate the proposed damage detection methodology. Five externally bonded PZT transducers are uniformly distributed at the surface of the ECC layer of the beams to measure the output conductance signatures in a healthy state and in different damage scenarios induced by different load levels. Test results showed that discrepancies exist between the signals measured in the intact state and each damage state, which can be used to evaluate the structural integrity changes. To assess the damage of ECC-concrete composite beams quantitatively, the statistical scalar index-root mean square deviation (RMSD) is used as the index, which can be calculated from the variations of conductance measurements of PZT sensors. The damage index values of the uniformly distributed PZT sensors provided cogent evidence of damage and revealed the evolution of structural damage. The crack patterns of beams at different damage levels are compared with the damage index values, and it shows the damage location can be derived from the measured conductance signatures of an array of PZT transducers.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-06-27", "authors": ["FengjiangQin", "ZhigangZhang", "BoXie", "RuiSun"], "doi": "10.3390/s19122799\n10.1007/BF02473191\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.159\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2008.08.002\n10.1016/j.engfracmech.2011.06.003\n10.1007/s11431-014-5478-4\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2012.01.011\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.08.132\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.08.036\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.11.001\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.08.166\n10.1080/10298436.2017.1356173\n10.3390/ma6072831\n10.3141/2640-09\n10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2019.05.014\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000667\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.03.026\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.06.054\n10.1617/s11527-009-9544-5\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1177/1045389X13481254\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2012.01.012\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.09.006\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.074\n10.12989/sss.2009.5.1.081\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.10.060\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.042\n10.1016/j.cma.2004.08.007\n10.1016/j.jsv.2010.08.013\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.02.011\n10.3390/s101211644\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.01.039\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.165\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.089\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.11.072\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.3390/s17071641\n10.3390/s18061782"}

The PVDF energy harvester integrated with a PPy electrode had the piezoelectric output voltage of 4.24-4.56 V, while the PVDF energy harvester with an additional aluminum-foil electrode exhibited 2.57 V. Alkaline treatment and chemical vapor deposition with n-dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS) were employed to improve the adhesion between the PVDF and PPy and the resistance to over-oxidation in aqueous solutions. The PVDF film modified by an alkaline treatment could have the improved adhesion via the introduction of polar functional groups to its surface, which was confirmed by the ultrasonication. The surface hydrophobicity of the PPy electrode was enhanced by the DTMS coating, resulting in the improvement of the resistance to over-oxidation with a water contact angle of 111\u00b0. Even with the hydrophobic coating, the electrodes remained electroconductive and continued to transfer an electric charge, maintaining the piezoelectricity of the PVDF film.

In this regard, GNR and its parent CNT were melt mixed with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix using a miniature melt mixer at various nanofiller loadings, i.e., 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt%, and then compression molded. Molecular simulations showed that CNT would have a better interaction with the PVDF matrix in any configuration. Rheological results validated that CNTs feature a far stronger network (mechanical interlocking) than GNRs. Despite lower powder conductivity and a comparable dispersion state, it was interestingly observed that CNT nanocomposites indicated a highly superior electrical conductivity and EMI shielding at higher nanofiller loadings.

Artificial skins can help robots to have the same sense of touch, especially for their social interactions. This paper presents a pressure mapping sensing using piezo-resistive fabric to represent aspects of the sense of touch. In past few years' electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is considered to be able offer a good alternative for artificial skin in particular for its ease of adaptation for large area skin compared to individual matrix based sensors. The EIT has also very good temporal performance in data collection allowing for monitoring of fast responses to touch stimulation, enabling a truly real time touch sensing. Electromechanical responses of a conductive fabric can be exploited using EIT to create a low cost and large area touch sensing. Such electromechanical properties are often very complex, so to improve the imaging resolution and touch visibility an artificial intelligent (AI) was used in addition to the state of the art spatio-temporal imaging algorithm. This work demonstrates a step towards an integrated seamless skin with large area sensing in dynamical settings, closer to natural human skin's behaviour. For the first time a dynamical touch sensing are studies by means of a spatio-temporal based electrical impedance tomography (EIT) imaging on a conductive fabric.

{"title": "Frequency dependence of surface acoustic wave swimming.", "abstract": "Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are elastic waves that can be excited directly on the surface of piezoelectric crystals using a transducer, leading to their exploitation for numerous technological applications, including for example microfluidics. Recently, the concept of SAW streaming, which underpins SAW microfluidics, was extended to make the first experimental demonstration of 'SAW swimming', where instead of moving water droplets on the surface of a device, SAWs are used as a propulsion mechanism. Using theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that the SAW swimming force can be controlled directly by changing the SAW frequency, due to attenuation and changing force distributions within each SAW streaming jet. Additionally, an optimum frequency exists which generates a maximum SAW swimming force. The SAW frequency can therefore be used to control the efficiency and forward force of these SAW swimming devices. The SAW swimming propulsion mechanism also mimics that used by many microorganisms, where propulsion is produced by a cyclic distortion of the body shape. This improved understanding of SAW swimming provides a test-bed for exploring the science of microorganism swimming, and could bring new insight to the evolutionary significance for the length and beating frequency of swimming microbial flagella.", "journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "date": "2019-06-20", "authors": ["CPouya", "KHoggard", "S HGossage", "H RPeter", "TPoole", "G RNash"], "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2019.0113\n10.1112/plms/s1-17.1.4\n10.1063/1.1754276\n10.1103/RevModPhys.83.647\n10.1039/c3lc50361e\n10.7567/JJAPS.28S1.126\n10.1109/ULTSYM.1989.67063\n10.1039/b915522h\n10.1063/1.2889951\n10.1016/0924-4247(96)80086-0\n10.1143/JJAP.43.2987\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.034502\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141418\n10.1371/journal.pone.0042686\n10.1016/0022-460X(78)90388-7\n10.1103/PhysRevE.89.013203\n10.1088/1742-6596/269/1/012011\n10.1063/1.4999308\n10.1063/1.103964\n10.1021/ac400548d\n10.1039/c004506c\n10.1002/adma.201004455\n10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601\n10.1088/0034-4885/78/5/056601\n10.1098/rspa.1951.0218\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.4102\n10.1016/j.mcm.2010.03.054\n10.3390/mi5010097\n10.1063/1.3079655"}

{"title": "Possible Improvement of the Sagittal Spinopelvic Alignment and Balance through \"Locomotion Training\" Exercises in Patients with \"Locomotive Syndrome\": A Literature Review.", "abstract": "On the basis of rapid population aging, in 2007, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) proposed a new disease concept \"locomotive syndrome\" as a degenerative condition of reduced mobility due to the impairment of the musculoskeletal system. Worsened locomotive components, which consist of bones, joints, and intervertebral discs, and muscles and nerves, can lead to symptoms such as pain, limited range of motion, malalignment, impaired balance, and difficulty in walking, ultimately resulting in the requirement of nursing care. \"Locomotive syndrome\" has gained increased interest in Japan but still not worldwide. Hence, in this brief review, we summarize an updated definition, assessment, and management of \"locomotive syndrome\". The JOA recommends \"locomotion training\" exercise intervention to be effective in maintaining motor function that comprises two simple exercises-squatting and single-leg standing. However, the extent to which exercises affect \"locomotive syndrome\" is unknown. Here, we further report hypothesis-generating patient cases who presented the improved sagittal spinopelvic alignment in standing radiographs and postural stability in piezoelectric force-plate measurements through our 6-month \"locomotion training\" outpatient rehabilitation program. It is noteworthy that \"locomotion training\" facilitated these improvements despite the presence of specific disorders including thoracic kyphosis and symptomatic lumbar spinal canal stenosis. This raises the need for further investigations to clarify effects of \"locomotion training\" exercises on the spinal alignment, global balance, and quality of life in patients with \"locomotive syndrome\".", "journal": "Advances in orthopedics", "date": "2019-06-19", "authors": ["TakashiYurube", "MasaakiIto", "ToruTakeoka", "NobuyoshiWatanabe", "HideyoInaoka", "KenichiroKakutani", "RyosukeKuroda", "KotaroNishida"], "doi": "10.1155/2019/6496901\n10.1007/s00776-007-1202-6\n10.1007/s00776-011-0108-5\n10.1097/00007632-200212010-00002\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181a01b3f\n10.1007/s00774-009-0080-8\n10.2196/ijmr.5590\n10.1007/s00776-011-0160-1\n10.1519/jpt.0000000000000033\n10.1007/s00776-015-0741-5\n10.2147/CIA.S148683\n10.1007/s00776-015-0737-1\n10.1007/s00776-011-0193-5\n10.1007/s00776-014-0606-3\n10.1016/j.jos.2015.12.012\n10.1080/14397595.2016.1226471\n10.1001/jama.291.16.1999\n10.1093/gerona/50A.Special_Issue.147\n10.1016/S0749-0690(02)00004-6\n10.1046/j.1532-5415.2002.50601.x\n10.1007/BF03324539\n10.1016/j.apmr.2006.04.005\n10.1007/s00198-006-0256-1\n10.1016/j.apmr.2011.08.042\n10.7861/clinmedicine.15-6-s88\n10.1186/1472-6963-8-278\n10.1590/S1413-35552012005000148\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a008900\n10.14814/phy2.12493\n10.1177/0898264315611665\n10.1007/s00776-006-1057-2\n10.1007/s00198-008-0794-9\n10.1007/s00198-007-0400-6\n10.1007/s40279-014-0227-1\n10.3109/14397595.2013.854063\n10.1097/01.brs.0000160842.43482.cd\n10.1097/01.brs.0000231725.38943.ab\n10.1097/00002060-199609000-00013\n10.1080/03630242.2013.817505\n10.1097/BRS.0b013e31823e15e2\n10.1097/00007632-199520120-00005"}

{"title": "One-step tailoring surface roughness and surface chemistry to prepare superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes for enhanced membrane distillation performances.", "abstract": "Superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane is a promising material for membrane distillation. Existing approaches for preparing superhydrophobic PVDF membrane often involve separate manipulation of surface roughness and surface chemistry. Here we report a one-step approach to simultaneously manipulate both the surface roughness and surface chemistry of PVDF nanofibrous membranes for enhanced direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) performances. The manipulation was realized in a unique solvent-thermal treatment process, during which a treatment solution containing alcohols was involved. We demonstrate that by using different chain-length alcohols in the treatment solvent, surface roughness can be promoted by creating nanofin structures on the PVDF nanofibers using an alcohol which has moderate affinity with PVDF. Meanwhile, surface chemistry can be tuned by adjusting the fraction distribution of crystal phases (nonpolar \u03b1 phase and polar \u03b2 phase) in the membrane using different alcohols. PVDF membranes with different surface wettabilities were used to evaluate the effects of surface roughness and surface energy on the DCMD performances. Combining both low surface energy and multi-scale surface roughness, pentanol-treated PVDF membrane achieved best anti-water property (water contact angle of 164.1\u00b0 and sliding angle of 8.1\u00b0), and exhibited superior water flux and enhanced anti-wetting ability to low-surface-tension feed in the DCMD application.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2019-06-15", "authors": ["WeihuaQing", "JianqiangWang", "XiaohuaMa", "ZhikanYao", "YongFeng", "XiaonanShi", "FuLiu", "PengWang", "Chuyang YTang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2019.06.011"}

Thus, we developed a novel IONM system with an accelerometer sensor that uses the piezoelectric effect instead of EMG to detect laryngeal twitching. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this novel IONM system during thyroid surgery in a porcine model.\nWe developed an accelerometer sensor that uses the piezoelectric effect to measure laryngeal twitching in three dimensions. This novel accelerometer sensor was placed in the anterior neck skin (transcutaneous) or postcricoid area. Stimulus thresholds, amplitude, and latency of laryngeal twitching measured using the accelerometer sensor were compared to those measured through EMG of the vocalis muscle.\nThe amplitudes of the accelerometer sensor at the anterior neck and postcricoid area were significantly lower than those of EMG because of differences in the measurement method used to evaluate laryngeal movement. However, no significant differences in stimulus thresholds between the EMG endotracheal tube and transcutaneous or postcricoid accelerometer sensors were observed.\nAccelerometer sensors located at the anterior neck or postcricoid area were able to identify laryngeal twitching. The stimulus intensity measured with these sensors was equivalent to that from conventional vocalis EMG. Our novel IONM system with an accelerometer sensor that checks changes in surface acceleration can be an alternative to EMG of the vocalis muscle for IONM in the future.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology", "date": "2019-06-15", "authors": ["Eui-SukSung", "Jin-ChoonLee", "Sung-ChanShin", "Hyun-KeunKwon", "Han-SeulNa", "Da-HeePark", "Seong-WookChoi", "Jung-HoonRo", "Byung-JooLee"], "doi": "10.21053/ceo.2019.00423"}

Recent advances in manufacturing, however, have enabled in such robots the ability for operation at multiple stride frequencies using multi-degree-of-freedom leg trajectories. Proprioceptive sensing and control is key to extending the capabilities of these robots to a broad range of operating conditions. In this work, we use concomitant sensing for piezoelectric actuation with a computationally efficient framework for estimation and control of leg trajectories on a quadrupedal microrobot. We demonstrate accurate position estimation (<16[Formula: see text] root-mean-square error) and control (<16[Formula: see text] root-mean-square tracking error) during locomotion across a wide range of stride frequencies (10 Hz-50 Hz). This capability enables the exploration of two bioinspired parametric leg trajectories designed to reduce leg slip and increase locomotion performance (e.g. speed, cost-of-transport (COT), etc). Using this approach, we demonstrate high performance locomotion at stride frequencies (10 Hz-30 Hz) where the robot's natural dynamics result in poor open-loop locomotion.

The sensor can be conformally wrapped around the external surface of the prosthesis. Its design, mechanical properties and dimensions are properly characterized and optimized in order to maximize performances and to avoid any interference with the graft structure during its activity. The sensorized graft is tested in vitro using a pulsatile recirculating flow system that mimics the physiological and pathological blood flow conditions. In this way, the ability of the device to measure real-time variations of the hemodynamics parameters has been tested.

ScAlN is known to exhibit higher piezoelectric properties compared to pure AlN leading to significant performance improvements in various piezoelectric micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) applications including PMUTs. Here, the concentration of Sc in the actual sputtered 1- [Formula: see text]-thick ScAlN film was 36%, which is slightly below the maximum at the phase boundary. The ScAlN PMUTs were fabricated from an SOI wafer, where the dry etching of ScAlN film was optimized. The frequency response and displacement sensitivity of the PMUTs were characterized in the air using laser Doppler vibrometry confirming 2\u00d7 higher transverse piezoelectric coefficient than AlN. The acoustic transmission and reception of the PMUTs were evaluated from a high-sensitivity microphone and pulse-echo measurements. The PMUTs were designed to operate below 100 kHz in order to mitigate the absorption loss, which resulted in a high transmit pressure of 105-dB sound pressure level (SPL) at 10 cm and only 30-dB attenuation at the 2-m range. Through implementing 36% ScAlN film, the presented PMUTs exhibited a large displacement and consequently, a high SPL compared to the state-of-the-art PMUTs and the bulk transducer considering the size and the excitation voltage.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-06-11", "authors": ["YuriKusano", "ItaruIshii", "TatsuyaKamiya", "AkihikoTeshigahara", "Guo-LunLuo", "David AHorsley"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2921983"}
{"title": "Analysis of the Directivity of Glass-Etalon Fabry-P\u00e9rot Ultrasound Sensors.", "abstract": "Planar glass-etalon Fabry-P\u00e9rot (FP) optical ultrasound sensors offer an alternative to piezoelectric sensors for the measurements of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) fields and other metrological applications. In this work, a model of the frequency-dependent directional response of the FP sensor was developed using the global matrix method, treating the sensor as a multilayered elastic structure. The model was validated against the experimentally measured directional response of an air-backed cover-slip FP sensor with well-known material properties. In addition, the model was compared with the measurements of an all-hard-dielectric sensor suitable for HIFU measurements. The model was then used to calculate modal dispersion curves for both glass-etalon sensors, allowing the features of the directional response to be linked to specific wave phenomena. The features in the directivity of the air-backed cover-slip sensor are due to guided Lamb waves. Symmetric Lamb modes give rise to regions of high sensitivity, whereas anti-symmetric modes cause regions of low sensitivity. For the all-hard-dielectric sensor, two features correspond to the water-substrate and water-spacer compressional and shear critical angles. A region of high sensitivity close to the shear critical angle is associated with a leaky-Rayleigh wave, which has a frequency-dependent phase speed. At higher frequencies, this feature is counteracted by a region of low sensitivity, which occurs when there is no difference in the vertical displacement of the mirrors forming the FP cavity. The model may be used to improve and optimize the design of FP sensors or could be used to assist with the accurate deconvolution of the directional response from array measurements in metrological and imaging applications.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-06-11", "authors": ["Danny RRamasawmy", "EleanorMartin", "James AGuggenheim", "Edward ZZhang", "Paul CBeard", "Bradley ETreeby", "Ben TCox"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2921735"}

{"title": "Scour Damage Detection and Structural Health Monitoring of a Laboratory-Scaled Bridge Using a Vibration Energy Harvesting Device.", "abstract": "A vibration-based bridge scour detection procedure using a cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvesting device (EHD) is proposed here. This has an advantage over an accelerometer-based method in that potentially, the requirement for a power source can be negated with the only power requirement being the storage and/or transmission of the data. Ideally, this source of power could be fulfilled by the EHD itself, although much research is currently being done to explore this. The open-circuit EHD voltage is used here to detect bridge frequency shifts arising due to scour. Using one EHD attached to the central bridge pier, both scour at the pier of installation and scour at another bridge pier can be detected from the EHD voltage generated during the bridge free-vibration stage, while the harvester is attached to a healthy pier. The method would work best with an initial modal analysis of the bridge structure in order to identify frequencies that may be sensitive to scour. Frequency components corresponding to harmonic loading and electrical interference arising from experiments are removed using the filter bank property of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). These frequencies can then be monitored by using harvested voltage from the energy harvesting device and successfully utilised towards structural health monitoring of a model bridge affected by scour.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-06-09", "authors": ["Paul CFitzgerald", "AbdollahMalekjafarian", "BasurajBhowmik", "Luke JPrendergast", "PaulCahill", "Chul-WooKim", "BudhadityaHazra", "VikramPakrashi", "Eugene JOBrien"], "doi": "10.3390/s19112572\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.06.039\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.079\n10.1007/s12205-017-1409-9\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000931\n10.1155/2016/7871089\n10.1007/s13349-017-0238-3\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2013.09.015\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.07.021\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000146\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000826\n10.1177/0583102406061499\n10.1109/TIE.2009.2015754\n10.1177/1045389X11417650\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1016/j.ijengsci.2013.07.004\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/8/085014\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0001262\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000608\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.007\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.10.015\n10.2514/1.25047\n10.1111/mice.12228\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.04.046\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2015.11.006\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/303\n10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.021\n10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00559-8\n10.1177/1475921718760483\n10.1016/S0141-0296(96)00149-6\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2009.02.013\n10.1002/stc.2146\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.08.037\n10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.090\n10.1016/j.soildyn.2013.07.012\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/12/125029\n10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000109"}

Piezoelectric instrumentation (PEI) has previously been shown to be a\u00a0precise and safe surgical instrument in rhinoplasty. It offers good preservation of surrounding soft tissue and high cutting precision and thus a\u00a0good surgical applicability in rhinoplasty.\nThis article presents experiences using PEI for cartilage preparation and modelling for various indications in facial plastic surgery. The use of PEI in rhinoplasty, its safety and preciseness were evaluated and postoperative results are discussed with respect to facial swelling and bruising.\nThis retrospective study included 35\u00a0patients undergoing rhinoplasty and follow-up. Surgery was conducted by two expert surgeons in rhinoplasty in the department of otorhinolaryngology at the University Clinic of LMU Munich. Surgical performance of PEI in comparison with conventional instruments was evaluated by a\u00a0customized questionnaire. The postoperative assessment of pain, facial swelling and bruising was documented.\nThis article presents the different options for the use of PEI in rhinoplasty. In bone modelling procedures, such as hump removal, osteotomy and bony fixations, PEI was evaluated as being superior to conventional instruments. Intraoperative bleeding was reduced, which led to reduced facial swelling and/or bruising. Postoperative pain assessment showed no or only mild pain in two thirds of the patients.\nThe results show that PEI enables a\u00a0safe and very precise operation.

{"title": "Tunable filter and modulator with controlled bandwidth and wide dynamic range based on planar thin films structure.", "abstract": "Tunable narrowband spectral filters with high throughput and wide dynamic range are in high demand for many applications, however, a cost is usually associated with the filter narrowing either in the dynamic range, in the throughput or the manufacturability. Here it is shown for the first time that using the coupling between waveguide and lossy modes (LMs) in lossy ultrathin films through thin film coupling layer it is possible to obtain a reflection peak with controllable width (sub-Angstroms till tens of nm) and tunability over wide spectral range (>500nm in the visible and near infrared). The excitation of broadband LM is enabled using an ultrathin absorptive layer with high imaginary to real part ratio of the dielectric constant (i.e 6nm of Cr). The wider dynamic range and higher contrast are observed more with TE polarization than TM. The tuning is achieved by incidence angle scan of few degrees or by modulating the waveguide layer from the visible till the near infrared and in principle it can be designed to operate in any spectral range. Such a thin waveguide layer can allow tuning at ultrahigh speed using conventional electrooptic, magnetooptic, piezoelectric or thermooptic materials using relatively low external fields. The tuning sensitivity and range depend strongly on the waveguide layer thickness and the refractive index mismatch between the waveguide and the coupling layer. Under small index mismatch new peaks are seen via Rabi type splitting with gaps as high as 700nm or more, thus exhibiting ultrahigh tuning with negative sensitivity.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2019-06-06", "authors": ["IbrahimAbdulhalim"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.27.016156"}

A unique focusing element was needed to condense these X-rays from an initial large cross section (11.0 mm H \u00d7 4.2 mm V) into a required spot size of FWHM \u2248680 \u03bcm (H) \u00d7 20 \u03bcm (V) at a variable position between the sample and the detector. The large numerical aperture is achieved by coating a silicon substrate over 1 m long with three multilayer stripes of Bragg angle 4.2 mrad. One stripe selects X-rays of each energy 40.0, 65.4, and 76.6 keV. Sixteen piezoelectric bimorph actuators attached to the sides of the mirror substrate adjusted the reflecting surface's shape. Focal spots of vertical width < 15 \u00b5m were obtained at three positions over a 0.92 m range, with fast, easy switching from one focal position to another. Minimized root mean square slope errors were close to 0.5 \u00b5rad after subtraction of a uniform curvature. Reflectivity curves taken along each stripe showed consistent high peaks with generally small angular variation of peak positions.

The synthesized membranes possess a delicate organic core of PVDF-HFP and an inorganic shell of a CuO nanosheet structure, which endows super-flexible properties owing to the merits of PVDF-HFP backbones, and superhydrophilic functions contributed by the extremely rough surface of a CuO nanosheet anchored on flexible PVDF-HFP. Such an organic core and inorganic shell architecture not only functionalizes membrane performance in terms of antifouling, high flux, and low energy consumption, but also extends the lifespan by enhancing its mechanical strength and alkaline resistance to broaden its applicability. The resultant membrane exhibits good oil/water separation efficiency higher than 99.7%, as well as excellent anti-fouling properties for various oil/water mixtures. Considering the intrinsic structural innovation and its integrated advantages, this core-shell nanofibrous membrane is believed to be promising for oil/water separation, and this facile approach is also easy for scaled up manufacturing of functional organic/inorganic nanofibrous membranes with insightful benefits for industrial wastewater treatment, sensors, energy production, and many other related areas.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2019-06-06", "authors": ["ZhiLiu", "DetaoQin", "JianghuiZhao", "QuanFeng", "ZhengtaoLi", "HongweiBai", "Darren DelaiSun"], "doi": "10.3390/polym11060974\n10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.027\n10.1038/nature11477\n10.1038/nature06599\n10.1039/b809074m\n10.1038/nature10381\n10.1126/science.1203771\n10.1039/C8PY00378E\n10.1177/0263617418816200\n10.1039/c0cc01143f\n10.1016/j.watres.2012.09.059\n10.1016/j.memsci.2018.10.035\n10.1126/science.1099074\n10.1038/519S2a\n10.1021/nn506633b\n10.1002/anie.200353381\n10.1039/C6NR01298A\n10.1002/smll.201503685\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.02.135\n10.1002/adma.201304487\n10.1016/j.desal.2014.11.023\n10.1002/anie.201700684\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.04.115\n10.1002/adma.201305112\n10.1038/nature10447\n10.1002/anie.201405785\n10.1016/j.cej.2016.05.026\n10.1002/adma.201102616\n10.1002/adma.201200797\n10.1021/acsami.5b03625\n10.1038/srep02326\n10.1002/adma.201301480\n10.1038/srep24365\n10.1007/s13204-019-01014-4\n10.1002/mame.201800669\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.01.075\n10.1007/s10853-016-0472-9\n10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.03.033\n10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.076\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.02.057\n10.1016/j.vacuum.2008.10.003\n10.1039/C6TA04155H\n10.1016/j.matlet.2004.06.031\n10.1039/C4RA12163E\n10.1039/C6EN00505E\n10.1016/S0269-8579(05)80034-6\n10.1039/C4CS00220B\n10.1002/adma.200400401"}

{"title": "Automated piezoelectric spraying of biological and enzymatic assays for effect-directed analysis of planar chromatograms.", "abstract": "Bioanalytical questions are more and more solved by bioassays directly in situ the planar separation. If compared to chemical derivatization in situ, several reagent applications on the same chromatogram make the workflow for enzymatic and biological assays more complex. Hence, if compared to piezoelectric spraying of chemical derivatization reagents, an assay transfer to the piezoelectric spraying technique was much more challenging. Important aspects were investigated, i.e., plate pre-wetting, spraying nozzle type and applied volumes for microorganism suspension as well as enzyme and substrate-chromogenic solutions. Finally, with the newly developed piezoelectric spraying procedures for the application of biological (Aliivibrio fischeri) and enzymatic (acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase) assays, several obstacles of the state-of-the-art automated immersion were avoided such as the (1) required high volumes of solutions, (2) tailing of highly water-soluble zones upon slow plate withdrawal, (3) zone distortion or shift observed after previous buffer salt applications or long/slow immersion times/speeds, (4) gradual inactivation of the enzyme solution along with its ongoing re-use, and (5) lack of covering the whole plate surface. The benchmarking of both techniques also showed that simplicity remains the key argument for immersion. As proof of concept, piezoelectrically sprayed autograms were compared with those of immersion, by taking the example of Peganum harmala (P. h.) seed extract. The plate background and thus homogeneity of the applied solutions were found to be almost comparable. Three bands among the pronounced fluorescent bands were responsible for the most antibacterial activity of P. h. seed extract in the A. fischeri bioassay and were also inhibiting the AChE. These AChE and three further BChE inhibitors were detected, whereby the AChE inhibition was twice as strong as the BChE inhibition. By their in situ HRMS spectra, the active zones in the P. h. seed extract were assigned to be the AChE-inhibiting \u03b2-carboline alkaloids, harmine, harmaline and ruine, as well as the BChE-inhibiting quinazoline alkaloids, vasicine and deoxyvasicine, and the \u03b2-carboline alkaloid harmol.

Remarkable progress toward this goal has been made through the development of advanced stopped-flow mixing techniques resulting in reduced dead times, and thereby extending reaction monitoring capabilities to numerous biochemical systems. Concurrently, piezoelectric actuators for through-space liquid droplet sample delivery have also been applied in several experimental systems, providing discrete picoliter sample volume delivery and precision sample deposition onto a surface, free of confinement within microfluidic devices, tubing, or other physical constraints. Here, we characterize the inertial mixing kinetics of two aqueous droplets (130 pl) produced by piezoelectric-actuated pipettes, following droplet collision in free space and deposition on a surface in a proof of principle experiment. A time-resolved fluorescence system was developed to monitor the mixing and fluorescence quenching of 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (5-Tamra) and N-Bromosuccinimide, which we show to occur in less than 10 ms. In this respect, this methodology is unique in that it offers millisecond mixing capabilities for very small quantities of discrete sample volumes. Furthermore, the use of discrete droplets for sample delivery and mixing in free space provides potential advantages, including the elimination of the requirement for a physical construction as with microfluidic systems, and thereby makes possible and extends the experimental capabilities of many systems.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-06-04", "authors": ["Jamie L YWu", "FriedjofTellkamp", "MazdakKhajehpour", "Wesley DRobertson", "R J DwayneMiller"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5050270"}
{"title": "Absolute quasi-static calibration method of piezoelectric high-pressure sensor based on force sensor.", "abstract": "In this paper, a strain-gauge-type force sensor which can be directly mounted on the existing drop-weight device and used to calibrate the piezoelectric high-pressure sensor is designed. The absolute quasistatic pressure calibration principle and the measurement principle of the strain-gauge-type force sensor are described. Based on the mathematical relation model between force and pressure, the influence factors of pressure calibration accuracy are discussed, and the empirical formula for correcting the peak pressure is obtained. To analyze the mechanical strength of the force sensor, the modal parameters of the force sensor in the impact direction, and the pressure loss in the transmission process, a finite element simulation based on ANSYS software is performed. In addition, the static characteristic of the force sensor and the dynamic characteristic of the new drop-weight system composed of the force sensor, the mounting frame, and weight stacks are analyzed. To verify the accuracy of the empirical formula, the absolute quasistatic pressure calibration experiment is performed based on the calibration device. The final experimental results show that the accuracy of pressure calibration can be effectively improved by means of empirical formula correction. Taking the peak pressure measured by the reference pressure sensors as the standard value, the maximum calculation difference can be reduced from 3.42% (obtained by the direct calculation method) to 0.70% by the empirical formula correction method.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-06-04", "authors": ["TingweiGu", "FeiShang", "DerenKong", "ChundongXu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5083895"}
{"title": "A fast and accurate piezoelectric actuator modeling method based on truncated least squares support vector regression.", "abstract": "In order to improve the applicability of piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) in precision positioning, least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) is applied to model hysteresis in PEAs due to its high modeling accuracy and fast convergence speed. However, low robustness of LS-SVR makes modeling accuracy susceptible to noises, which makes LS-SVR hysteresis models difficult to be applied in engineering environment. In this article, a robust truncated least squares support vector regression (T-LSSVR) is proposed. With the truncation strategy, redundancy in the training set is reduced and robustness is improved. Parameters required for T-LSSVR are optimized by particle swarm optimization and cross optimization algorithms. To test the proposed approach, it is applied to predict the hysteresis of PEAs. Results show that the proposed method is more accurate and robust than other versions of LS-SVR when the training set is polluted by noises, and meanwhile reduces the sample size and increases computational efficiency.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-06-04", "authors": ["XiangdongLiu", "ZhibiaoMa", "XuefeiMao", "JinjunShan", "YijunWang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5086491"}
{"title": "Fractional repetitive control of nanopositioning stages for tracking high-frequency periodic inputs with nonsynchronized sampling.", "abstract": "The repetitive control (RC) has been employed for high-speed tracking control of nanopositioning stages due to its abilities of precisely tracking periodic trajectories and rejecting periodic disturbances. However, in digital implementation, the sampling frequency should be integer multiple of the tracking frequency of the desired periodic trajectory. Otherwise, the rounding error would result in a significant degradation of the tracking performance, especially for the case of high input frequencies. To mitigate this rounding effect, the fractional repetitive control (FRC) technique is introduced to control the nanopositioning stage so as to precisely track high-frequency periodic inputs without imposing constraints on the sampling frequency of the digital control system. The complete procedure of controller design and implementation is presented. The techniques to deal with the problems of non-minimum phase system and fractional delay points number are described in detail. The proposed FRC is plugged into the proportional-integral control, and implemented on a custom-built piezo-actuated nanopositioning stage. Validation experiments are conducted, and the results show that the tracking errors caused by the rounding effect in the traditional RC approach are almost completely eliminated, when tracking sinusoidal waveforms with frequencies from 1000 Hz to 1587.3 Hz under the sampling frequency of 50 kHz, where the fractional parts being rounded vary from 0 to 0.5.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-06-04", "authors": ["LinlinLi", "GuoyingGu", "LiMinZhu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5088673"}

Thus, detection of these harmful OP pesticides at an ease with high sensitivity and selectivity is the need of hour. Bio-sensing technology meet these requirements and has been employed at a large scale for detection. The present review is aimed mainly to provide the overview of the past and recent advances occurred in the field of biosensor technology employed for the detection of these OP compounds. The review describes the principle and strategy of various OP biosensors including electrochemical (amperometric, potentiometric), thermal, piezoelectric, optical (fluorescence, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)), microbial and DNA biosensors in detail. The electrochemical biosensors are generally, based on inhibition of enzyme, acetyl cholinesterase (AChE), butyryl cholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase and alkaline phosphatase or enzyme (organophosphorus hydrolase, OPH)) catalyzed reaction. The detection limits and linearity range of various OP biosensors have also been compared.

From the results, we propose an empirical equation for the spatial and temporal profile of the pressure pulse.

Finding ways to realize sample quantitative control by tuning the CMYK value, however, remains challenging. Herein, we studied the influence of the CMYK value on the ink volume jetted by ink cartridges. The regularity research on a single-color and two-colors was performed in two print mode-grayscale printing and color printing. The results demonstrated that the number of ink dots increased with the increase of the gray value and opacity value, which means that the amount of the bio-ink increases with the increase of the CMYK value. The 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine-horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide, glucose oxidase-horseradish peroxidase and bull serum albumin-citrate buffer-tetrabromophenol blue systems were chosen as examples to prove the print regularity.

{"title": "Dynamic navigation: a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement.", "abstract": "The objective of this prospective pilot clinical study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new dynamic navigation system and postoperative clinical outcomes.\nTen patients were recruited and 18 implants were placed. The surgery was performed with the navigation system and according to the virtual planning. Ten implants were placed using a flapless technique and eight implant sites were prepared with a combined piezo-drill method. The deviation between the real implant position obtained from the postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan and the planned implant position was measured.\nThe average deviation was 1.19 \u00b1 0.54 mm. The mean deviation measured at the insertion point was 1.04 \u00b1 0.47 mm and at the apical point it was 1.35 \u00b1 0.56 mm. The depth error was 0.43 \u00b1 0.34 mm. The axis deviation was 6.46 \u00b1 3.95 degrees. No significant differences were found between the flapless and the open-flap approaches and between the conventional and piezoelectric techniques. No complications occurred.\nThe accuracy values reported in this study are comparable, although not superior, to the literature data regarding dynamic and static computer-guided surgery. Dynamic navigation could increase the quality and safety of interventions and may reduce morbidity when compared with freehand insertion techniques.

{"title": "Fan-Out Wafer and Panel Level Packaging as Packaging Platform for Heterogeneous Integration.", "abstract": "Fan-out wafer level packaging (FOWLP) is one of the latest packaging trends in microelectronics. Besides technology developments towards heterogeneous integration, including multiple die packaging, passive component integration in packages and redistribution layers or package-on-package approaches, larger substrate formats are also targeted. Manufacturing is currently done on a wafer level of up to 12\"/300 mm and 330 mm respectively. For a higher productivity and, consequently, lower costs, larger form factors are introduced. Instead of following the wafer level roadmaps to 450 mm, panel level packaging (PLP) might be the next big step. Both technology approaches offer a lot of opportunities as high miniaturization and are well suited for heterogeneous integration. Hence, FOWLP and PLP are well suited for the packaging of a highly miniaturized energy harvester system consisting of a piezo-based harvester, a power management unit and a supercapacitor for energy storage. In this study, the FOWLP and PLP approaches have been chosen for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) package development with integrated SMD (surface mount device) capacitors. The process developments and the successful overall proof of concept for the packaging approach have been done on a 200 mm wafer size.

However, limited degrees of freedom (DOF) is an inherent drawback of existing FTS technologies. In this paper, a piezo-actuated serial structure FTS system is developed to obtain translational motions along with z and x-axis directions for ultra-precision machining. In addition, the principle of the developed 2-DOF FTS is introduced and explained. A high-rigidity four-bar (HRFB) mechanism is proposed to produce motion along the z-axis direction. Additionally, through a micro-rotation motion around flexible bearing hinges (FBHs), bi-directional motions along the x-axis direction can be produced. The kinematics of the mechanism are described using a matrix-based compliance modeling (MCM) method, and then the static analysis and dynamic analysis are performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Testing experiments were conducted to investigate the actual performance of the developed system. The results show that low coupling, proper travel, and high natural frequency are obtained.

{"title": "Novel Quasi-Solid-State Electrolytes based on Electrospun Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Fiber Membranes for Highly Efficient and Stable Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells.", "abstract": "To obtain new highly efficient and stable quasi-solid dye-sensitized solar cells (QS-DSSCs) that can meet the requirements for the large-scale commercial application of solar cells, we have developed a novel quasi-solid-state electrolyte, based on an electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The structure and properties of electrospun PVDF membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric (TG), and mechanical testing. The results indicate that the electrospun PVDF membrane has a three-dimensional network structure with extremely high porosity, which not only acts as a barrier to prevent electrolyte leakage but also provides a channel for the transmission of ions in the electrolyte, thereby effectively guaranteeing the high photoelectric conversion efficiency of the cells. The membrane was observed to withstand the conditions of hot-press (110 \u00b0C), and exhibited good thermal stability and mechanical strength, which are critical for the long-term stability and safety of the cells. The photovoltaic characteristics and stabilities of QS-DSSCs were compared with DSSCs based on an ionic liquid electrolyte (L-DSSC). QS-DSSCs with an 80 \u03bcm thick nanofiber electrolyte membrane showed a conversion efficiency of 8.63%, whereas an identical cell based on the corresponding ionic liquid electrolyte showed an efficiency of 9.30%. The stability test showed that, under indoor and outdoor conditions, after 390 h, the L-DSSCs failed. Meanwhile, the QS-DSSCs also maintained 84% and 77% of the original efficiency. The results show that, compared to the liquid electrolyte, the design of the quasi-solid electrolytes based on electrospun PVDF nanofiber membrane not only demonstrates the high conversion efficiency of DSSCs but also enhances the stability of the DSSCs, which provides the possibility for the fabrication of solar cells with higher efficiency and stability.", "journal": "Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-05-28", "authors": ["FanCheng", "YingOu", "GuoliangLiu", "LiZhao", "BinghaiDong", "ShiminWang", "ShengWen"], "doi": "10.3390/nano9050783\n10.1016/j.solener.2015.02.043\n10.1038/353737a0\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.077\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.12.112\n10.1007/s00396-011-2397-9\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.025\n10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.137\n10.1016/j.tca.2015.07.006\n10.1088/0268-1242/10/12/020\n10.1021/cm00055a012\n10.1016/S0927-0248(01)00027-7\n10.1021/cm9705855\n10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.185\n10.1038/35000172\n10.1063/1.1345834\n10.1016/j.renene.2011.07.015\n10.1002/pat.1675\n10.1007/s11082-013-9723-z\n10.1016/j.orgel.2012.07.038\n10.1016/j.electacta.2014.07.109\n10.1016/j.solmat.2010.04.029\n10.1016/j.electacta.2014.02.122\n10.1016/j.solmat.2008.09.045\n10.1007/s13233-011-0212-6\n10.1002/1521-3773(20020402)41:7<1221::AID-ANIE1221>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1021/cm960166s\n10.1209/epl/i1998-00233-9\n10.1016/S0032-3861(00)00250-0\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.037\n10.3390/ma9080671"}

{"title": "Intrinsic magnetism and biaxial strain tuning in two-dimensional metal halides V", "abstract": "A novel family of two-dimensional (2D) crystalline metal superhalogens V3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) with intrinsic magnetism was predicted using first-principles calculations in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The calculation results show that the V3Cl8 monolayer is an intrinsic anti-ferromagnetic semiconductor (AFS) with an indirect bandgap of 0.086 eV at the PBE functional level, while the V3X8 (X = F, Br, I) monolayer exhibits a fascinating ferromagnetic half-metal (FH) property with 100% spin-polarization at the Fermi level. Such 2D materials possess robust dynamical stability as well as thermal stability at room temperature except for V3Br8. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations based on the Ising model with the classical Heisenberg model estimate a Curie temperature of approximately 77 K and 103 K for the V3F8 and V3I8 systems, respectively. Furthermore, we predict an extraordinary phenomenon induced by biaxial compressive strain from the ferromagnetic half-metal (FH) to the ferromagnetic semiconductor (FS) at 2% strain and then to the antiferromagnetic metal (AM) with the biaxial strain increasing up to about 6.3% in the 2D V3I8 monolayer. In the case of 2D V3F8, as the strain varies from -10% to 8%, a series of electronic and magnetic phase transitions of AFS-AM-FH-AFS will occur. These tunable magnetic and electronic properties of 2D halides originate from the competition between AFM direct nearest-neighbor d-d exchange and FM superexchange via halogen p states, which leads to a variety of magnetic states. The explored controllable magnetic properties, electronic properties and the high Curie temperature render the 2D V3I8 monolayer a promising candidate for applications in magnetic logic devices and strain sensor devices.", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2019-05-23", "authors": ["HaiboXiao", "XiaonanWang", "RuilongWang", "LingfangXu", "ShihengLiang", "ChangpingYang"], "doi": "10.1039/c9cp00850k"}
{"title": "Ballistocardiogram signal processing: a review.", "abstract": "Across the world, healthcare costs are projected to continue to increase, and the pressure on the healthcare system is only going to grow in intensity as the rate of growth of elderly population increases in the coming decades. As an example, when people age one possible condition that they may experience is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). SDB, better known as the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, and associated cardiovascular complications are among the most common clinical disorders. The gold-standard approach to accurately diagnose OSA, is polysomnography (PSG), a test that should be performed in a specialist sleep clinic and requires a complete overnight stay at the clinic. The PSG system can provide accurate and real-time data; however, it introduces several challenges such as complexity, invasiveness, excessive cost, and absence of privacy. Technological advancements in hardware and software enable noninvasive and unobtrusive sensing of vital signs. An alternative approach which may help diagnose OSA and other cardiovascular diseases is the ballistocardiography. The ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal captures the ballistic forces of the heart caused by the sudden ejection of blood into the great vessels with each heartbeat, breathing, and body movement. In recent years, BCG sensors such as polyvinylidene fluoride film-based sensors, electromechanical films, strain Gauges, hydraulic sensors, microbend fiber-optic sensors as well as fiber Bragg grating sensors have been integrated within ambient locations such as mattresses, pillows, chairs, beds, or even weighing scales, to capture BCG signals, and thereby measure vital signs. Analysis of the BCG signal is a challenging process, despite being a more convenient and comfortable method of vital signs monitoring. In practice, BCG sensors are placed under bed mattresses for sleep tracking, and hence several factors, e.g., mattress thickness, body movements, motion artifacts, bed-partners, etc. can deteriorate the signal. In this paper, we introduce the sensors that are being used for obtaining BCG signals. We also present an in-depth review of the signal processing methods as applied to the various sensors, to analyze the BCG signal and extract physiological parameters such heart rate and breathing rate, as well as determining sleep stages. Besides, we recommend which methods are more suitable for processing BCG signals due to their nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics.", "journal": "Health information science and systems", "date": "2019-05-23", "authors": ["IbrahimSadek", "JitBiswas", "BessamAbdulrazak"], "doi": "10.1007/s13755-019-0071-7\n10.2174/1874120701004010201\n10.1172/JCI101145\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1939.127.1.1\n10.1152/advan.00025.2002\n10.1111/j.1475-097X.2012.01150.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.14.3.435\n10.1038/s41598-017-15829-0\n10.3390/s17112632\n10.1038/s41598-017-07248-y\n10.1007/s11760-018-1372-z\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912650\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2787628\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2600945\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1230440\n10.1109/TBME.2014.2314452\n10.1177/1045389X03014003006\n10.3233/JAE-2007-751\n10.1007/BF02430948\n10.1109/JBHI.2014.2314144\n10.2478/v10178-012-0065-0\n10.1109/JBHI.2014.2311582\n10.1016/j.bspc.2016.02.002\n10.1016/j.compind.2017.05.005\n10.1080/03091900903067424\n10.1088/0967-3334/34/2/123\n10.1038/s41598-017-13138-0\n10.1088/0967-3334/21/3/301\n10.1109/TBME.2004.828037\n10.1109/TBME.2005.857637\n10.1109/TBCAS.2012.2189007\n10.1088/0967-3334/26/4/007\n10.1109/TITB.2009.2034011\n10.1088/0967-3334/30/2/005\n10.1109/TBME.2009.2018831\n10.1109/TITB.2010.2044185\n10.1007/s11517-010-0722-y\n10.1109/TITB.2011.2128337\n10.1109/JSEN.2010.2091681\n10.3109/03091902.2013.807523\n10.3390/s16030409\n10.3233/AIS-170423\n10.1109/50.400697\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.10.013\n10.1364/AO.26.002171\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00043-6\n10.3390/s101009407\n10.3390/s150717115\n10.3390/s17102414\n10.1007/s10916-018-0917-6\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2262150\n10.1117/1.JBO.19.5.057001\n10.1109/JSEN.2013.2279160\n10.1016/j.bbe.2014.02.001\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.5.057006\n10.1117/1.JBO.20.1.010901\n10.1109/JBHI.2015.2392796\n10.3390/s17010111\n10.1002/jbio.201500268\n10.1007/s11818-017-0112-x\n10.5664/jcsm.6514"}

The secondary outcome was the occurrence of complications as a result of ESWL.\nThe average pain perception was reported at 5 on a scale from 0 to 10. The overall success rate of ESWL was found to be 43.9% and the success rate after the first ESWL was 35.1%. Univari-ate analysis showed no significant correlation between pain score and success of ESWL (p = 0.135). The level of intensity was correlated with pain scores (Pearson correlation -0.423, p < 0.001). Univariate analysis identified five predictive factors: sex, stone location, stone size, hydronephrosis and the use of tamsulosin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex, stone location and size independently in-fluenced the success of ESWL (p = 0.045, p = 0.001 and p < 0.001).\nNo correlation was found between the pain scores and efficacy of ESWL. Despite this absence, pain scores during ESWL sessions remain high and additional analgesia would improve patient satisfaction.", "journal": "Current urology", "date": "2019-05-23", "authors": ["ElkeBovelander", "SaskiaWeltings", "MandanaRad", "Paulienvan Kampen", "Rob C MPelger", "HossainRoshani"], "doi": "10.1159/000489424"}

In this paper, a supersensitive multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) sensor of bacterium based on 16S rRNA and \"DNA-RNA switch\" was constructed. The fragment in specific region of 16S rRNA was used as the biomarker of bacterium to ensure high specificity and to achieve the accurate judgment of microbial vitality. \"DNA-RNA switch\" was designed to conduct two electrodes by switching insulated \"gene-link\" into conductive \"silver-link\", which achieved the super-sensitivity of MSPQC to bacteria. To demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy, a proof-of-concept method for Escherichia coli (E. coli) assay was designed. The detection limit was down to 2\u202fcfu/mL.

The key to reduce the spread and mortality rate of tuberculosis is to develop faster and more sensitive approaches for detection of M. tuberculosis. However, current detection methods can not meet the requirements of rapid clinical M. tuberculosis detection in terms of detection time. Herein, a new 16S rDNA multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) sensor based on Exonuclease III (Exo III)-aided target recycling has been developed for rapid detection of M. tuberculosis. The specific 16S rDNA fragment of M. tuberculosis was used as biomarker, DNA capture probes complementary to the biomarker were designed and modified on the surface of AuNPs. The Exo III which could recognise hybrid duplexes and selectively digest DNA capture probe was used to assist digestion cycle by digesting DNA capture probe and releasing the intact target fragment. After all DNA probes loading on the surface of AuNPs were removed, the surface of AuNPs was exposed and conductive connection was formed between the nanogap network electrode by self-catalytic growth of exposed AuNPs in the glucose and HAuCl", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2019-05-22", "authors": ["JialinZhang", "JiHuang", "FengjiaoHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2019.111322"}

Membrane morphology is manipulated by controlling liquid-liquid (L-L) and solid-liquid (S-L) demixing time, which is a function of the viscosity and water affinity of dope solutions. Consequently, the addition of NSs altered membrane morphology by affecting the diffusion rate during NS induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The performance results showed that the dope solution composed of 11/71.2/17.8\u202fwt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/triethyl phosphate (TEP)/toluene produced the most promising HF membrane for MD. The optimal membrane demonstrated a unique bicontinuous structure with increased porosity and mean pore size.

Piezoelectric materials, as zinc oxide (ZnO), can be a very interesting solution for scaffold development, as they can deliver electrical signals to cells upon mechanical solicitation, allowing the development of suitable microenvironments for tissue repair. This way, it is reported the deposition of ZnO thin films on a polymer by direct current magnetron sputtering, under different conditions, in order to obtain a piezoelectric ZnO thin film with potential for tissue repair applications. The obtained ZnO thin films were characterized in terms of morphology, crystallography, electrical conductivity, transmittance, piezoelectricity, and adhesion quality. The deposition process resulted in uniform films, with a very good adhesion to the substrate. The different deposition conditions influenced the evolution of the crystalline domains and preferential growths and consequently, the electrical properties of the films. One of the conditions resulted in a thin film with a high piezoelectric coefficient and a conductor behavior, being considered the most promising to act as a bioactive coating.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The research mainly focused on minimizing the fouling of polyvinylidene-fluoride membranes and maximizing the restoration of membrane permeability. The algal treatment alone was only moderately effective for the mitigation of fouling in microfiltration, while a markedly improved performance was achieved when the algal treatment followed ozonation. The combination of ozonation and algal treatment reduced membrane permeability decline and significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) increased the reversibility of fouling after hydraulic washing. A longitudinal evaluation was also performed with a goal of achieving a robust removal of contaminants. Ozonation followed by algal treatment was very effective in attenuating both caffeine and carbamazepine, as well as removing organic matter and inorganic nutrients from ROC in a single bioreactor. In this study, an alkaline condition (\u223cpH 12), produced by microalgae in the light without supplemental aeration was applied for in-situ cleaning of fouled membranes. The result showed that the algal-induced cleaning successfully restored the permeability of organic-fouled membranes during the filtration of both raw and algal-treated ROC.

The primary aim of the research was to analyze the possible use of guided waves in partial circumferential debonding detection. Guided waves were excited and registered in reinforced concrete specimens with varying extents of debonding damage by piezoelectric sensors attached at both ends of the beams. Experimental results in the form of time-domain signals registered for variable extent of debonding were compared, and the relationships relating to the damage size and time of flight and average wave velocity were proposed. The experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions based on dispersion curves traced for the free rod of circular cross-section and rectangular reinforced concrete cross-section. The high agreement of theoretical and experimental data proved that the proposed method, taking advantage of average wave velocity, can be efficiently used for assessing debonding size in reinforced concrete structures. It was shown that the development of damage size in circumferential direction has a completely different impact on wave velocity than development of debonding length.

Here, we present a body-integrated self-powered system (BISS) that is a succinct, highly efficient, and cost-effective method to scavenge energy from human motions. The biomechanical energy of the moving human body can be harvested through a piece of electrode attached to skin. The basic principle of the BISS is inspired by the comprehensive effect of triboelectrification between soles and floor and electrification of the human body.

A single piezoelectric transducer glued in between two sheets of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) facilitates nearfield depth profiling of layered media. The detector electrodes are made of indium tin oxide (ITO) which is both electrically conducting as well as optically transparent, enabling an on-axis illumination through the detector. By mapping the active detector area, we show that it matches the design form precisely.

In this study embedded basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-polycaprolactone-polyvinylidene fluoride (PCL-PVDF) hybrid was designed and fabricated by electrospinning as a bio-functional nanofibrous scaffold for bone tissue engineering. After morphological characterization of the PCL-PVDF (bFGF) scaffold, nanofibers biocompatibility was investigated by culturing of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Then, the bone differentiation capacity of the iPSCs was evaluated when grown on the PCL-PVDF and PCL-PVDF (bFGF) scaffolds in comparison with culture plate as a control using evaluating of the common osteogenic markers. The viability assay displayed a significant increase in iPSCs survival rate when grown on the bFGF content scaffold. The highest alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization were detected in the iPSCs while grown on the PCL-PVDF (bFGF) scaffolds. Obtained results from gene and protein expression were also demonstrated the higher osteoinductive property of the bFGF content scaffold compared with the scaffold without it. According to the results, the release of bFGF from PCL-PVDF nanofibers increased survival and proliferation rate of the iPSCs, which followed by an increase in its osteogenic differentiation potential. Taking together, PCL-PVDF (bFGF) nanofibrous scaffold demonstrated that can be noted as a promising candidate for treating the bone lesions by tissue engineering products.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2019-05-14", "authors": ["Mohammad FoadAbazari", "FatemehSoleimanifar", "Seyed EhsanEnderami", "MahsaNematzadeh", "NavidNasiri", "FatemehNejati", "EhsanSaburi", "ShabanaliKhodashenas", "BehzadDarbasizadeh", "Mohammad MehdiKhani", "PegahGhoraeian"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.28933"}

However, there are still several issues accompanied by the use of prosthetic materials, such as low wear performance and catastrophic failure. Surface enhancement of biomaterials is a promising method that can improve the success rate of prosthetic operations without negatively affecting their bulk properties while improving the biocompatibility of implants and reducing infections. Nonthermal plasma treatment has become a ubiquitous surface modification method in sterilization and healthcare applications. However, the clinical applications of such an approach have been limited due to the lack of detailed studies delineating the wear behavior and biocompatibility of implants after plasma treatment. In this study, we have employed a handheld piezoelectric direct discharge (PDD) plasma generator to modify the surface of two common metallic (Ti6Al4V) and nonmetallic (GUR1020 polymer) biomaterials used typically in joint and disc replacements. We have observed an approximately 60-fold reduction in tribological wear rate along with a 2- to 3-fold increase in the biocompatibility properties of plasma coated samples compared to noncoated (untreated) surfaces, respectively.

In this review, we focus particularly on the detection of a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, protein survivin (Sur), a ubiquitous re-organizer of the cell life cycle with the ability to inhibit the apoptosis and induce an enhanced proliferation leading to the unimpeded cancer growth and metastasis. Herein, we critically evaluate the progress in the development of novel biosensing systems and biosensors for the detection of two survivin (Sur) biomarkers: the Sur protein and its messenger RNA (Sur mRNA), including immunosensors, electrochemical piezo- and impedance-sensors, electrochemi-luminescence biosensors, genosensors based on oligonucleotide molecular beacons (MBs) with fluorescent or electrochemical transduction, as well as the microfluidic and related analytical platforms based on solution chemistry. The in-situ applications of survivin biomarkers' detection technologies to equip nanocarriers of the controlled drug delivery systems with MB-based fluorescence imaging capability, apoptosis control, and mitigation of the acquired drug resistance are also presented and critically evaluated. Finally, we turn the attention to the application of biosensors for the analysis of Sur biomarkers in exosomes and circulating tumor cells for a non-invasive liquid biopsy.

The internal nanofiber morphology is unique and unlike a normal blend, with individual phase-separated and randomly distributed fibrils of Nafion and PVDF (\u223c2-7 nm in diameter) that are bundled together and aligned in the fiber axis direction (where the fiber diameter is \u223c500 nm). This morphology is retained when fiber mats are hot-pressed into dense films. The physicochemical properties of the electrospun blended fibers are also highly unusual and unanticipated. As shown in this study, each polymer component influences the thermal and structural behavior of the other, especially in the dry state. Thus, dry composite polymer mats and membranes exhibit properties and attributes that are not observed for either pure PVDF or pure Nafion. Experimental results indicate that: (i) PVDF imparts conformational constraints on the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone chains of Nafion, resulting in an increased 21 helical conformation that effects Nafion's water uptake and thermal properties; and (ii) dipole-dipole interactions between PVDF polymer chains and Nafion make the \u03b2-phase polymorph of PVDF much more stable at elevated temperatures.

In recent years, an important goal has been to push the focusing spot size to the diffraction limit of \u223c10\u2005nm. The multilayer-based Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirror system is one of the most important methods used to achieve this goal. This method was chosen by the nanoprobe beamline of the Phase-II project at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. To overcome the limitations of current polishing technologies, the use of an additional phase compensator was necessary to decrease the wavefront distortions. In this experiment, a prototype phase compensator has been created to show how to obtain precise wavefront compensation. With the use of finite-element analysis and Fizeau interferometer measurements, some important factors such as the piezoresponse, different actuator distributions, stability and hysteresis were investigated. A global optimization method based on the measured piezoresponse has also been developed. This method overcame the limitations of the previous local algorithm related to the adjustment of every single actuator for compact piezoelectric layouts. The mirror figure can approach a target figure after several iterations. The figure difference can be reduced to several nanometres, which is far better than the mirror figure errors. The prototype was also used to successfully compensate for the real wavefront errors from upstream and for its own figure errors, measured using the speckle scanning technique.

The expression of temperature-sensitive ion channels has been extensively investigated because thermal stimulation often evokes tooth pain. However, temperature-sensitive ion channels cannot explain the sudden intense tooth pain evoked by innocuous temperatures or light air puffs, leading to the hydrodynamic theory emphasizing the microfluidic movement within the dentinal tubules for detection by mechanosensitive ion channels. Several mechanosensitive ion channels expressed in dental sensory systems have been suggested as key players in the hydrodynamic theory, and TRPM7, which is abundant in the odontoblasts, and recently discovered PIEZO receptors are promising candidates. Several ligand-gated ion channels and voltage-gated ion channels expressed in dental primary afferent neurons have been discussed in relation to their potential contribution to tooth pain.

The equivalent elasticity method is used to analyze the coupled vibration.

A mechanical coupling coefficient is introduced to connect these two equivalent vibrations. According to the electromechanical equivalent circuit, the resonance frequency equations as functions of the frequency and the mechanical coupling coefficient are acquired. The sound pressure level and far field sound pressure distribution for the transducer in water are simulated. It is demonstrated that the radiation range of the cylindrical transducer is larger than that of the ring-type transducer. Several prototypes of the transducer are fabricated; the radial and longitudinal resonance frequencies are measured. The experimental resonance frequencies are in good agreement with the analytical results.

The sensor was affixed to the skin directly above the muscle centre. The length of the adjustable sensor tip (3, 4.5 and 6 mm) determined the depth of the tip in the tissue and thus the initial pressure on the skin, fatty and muscle tissue. The depth of the tip increased the signal amplitude and slightly sped up the time course of the signal by shortening the delay time.

{"title": "Evaluation of Formalin Fixation for Tissue Biopsies Using Shear Wave Laser Speckle Imaging System.", "abstract": "Chemical fixation is the slowest and often the most uncontrolled step in the multi-step process of preparing tissue for histopathology. In order to reduce the time from taking a core needle biopsy to making a diagnosis, a new approach is proposed that optically monitors the common formalin fixation process. A low-cost and highly-sensitive laser speckle imaging technique is developed to measure shear wave velocity in a biospecimen as small as 0.5 mm in thickness submerged in millifluidic channels. Shear wave velocity, which is the indicator of tissue mechanical property and induced by piezoelectric-actuation, was monitored using gelatin phantom and chicken breast during fixation, as well as post-fixed liver and colon tissues from human. Fixation levels in terms of shear wave velocity increased by approximately 271.0% and 130.8% in gelatin phantom and chicken breast, respectively, before reaching the plateaus at 10.91 m/s and 7.88 m/s. Within these small specimens, the plateaus levels and times varied with location of measurement, and between gelatin and chicken breast. This optical-based approach demonstrates the feasibility of fine-tuning preanalytical variables, such as fixation time, for a rapid and accurate histopathological evaluation; provides a quality metric during the tissue preparation protocol performed in most pathology labs; and introduces the millifluidic chamber that can be engineered to be a future disposable device that automates biopsy processing and imaging.", "journal": "IEEE journal of translational engineering in health and medicine", "date": "2019-05-09", "authors": ["Saniel DLim", "QixuanHuang", "Eric JSeibel"], "doi": "10.1109/JTEHM.2019.2909914"}
{"title": "Moisture Effect on Particulate Matter Filtration Performance using Electro-Spun Nanofibers including Density Functional Theory Analysis.", "abstract": "In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the effect of moisture on the performance of three types of nanofiber (NF)-based air-filter media prepared by electrospinning polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylidene fluoride, and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Based on the DFT calculations of the intermolecular interactions between the NF-based filter media and water molecules, the PAN-NF filter is expected to exhibit the best performance in the wet state. Experiment studies also successfully demonstrate that the PAN-NF filter medium has better performance in the filtration of particulate matter (PM) than a commercial semi-high efficiency particulate air filter under wet conditions, and these results are in good agreement with the DFT calculation. The PAN-NF filter shows better performance because of its hydrophilic nature and the relatively low thickness the filter medium that allowed fast recovery of its PM-filtration performance.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2019-05-09", "authors": ["Han-JungKim", "Seon JooPark", "Dong-IkKim", "SanghyuckLee", "Oh SeokKwon", "Il KuKim"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-43127-4\n10.1038/nature15371\n10.1039/c2cs35095e\n10.1038/nature13774\n10.1021/es5022262\n10.1021/acsami.5b12313\n10.1002/anie.200501122\n10.1038/srep35472\n10.1080/10473289.2001.10464372\n10.1016/j.jiec.2017.02.006\n10.4209/aaqr.2015.02.0126\n10.1080/09593330.2016.1184319\n10.1021/acsami.7b03047\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b04596\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00771\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b04771\n10.1002/mame.201600353\n10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00178-7\n10.1039/C6RA17097H\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.01.121\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04673\n10.1002/app.24361\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b01404\n10.1002/smll.201603306\n10.1021/ja0356683\n10.1021/jp1021664\n10.1002/pssb.201100615\n10.1038/ncomms7205\n10.1016/j.msec.2007.10.088\n10.1038/nmat3577\n10.1295/polymj.30.463\n10.1039/C6RA12320A\n10.1021/jacs.6b02553\n10.1002/app.23246"}

Herein, we introduced a monolayer nano-polystyrene (PS) sphere confined growth method for obtaining CsPbBr3 nanonet films (NFs) with ordered nanostructures grown in the preferred (110) orientation, which is beneficial for the charge carrier transport and the light-harvesting efficiency. The (110) peak intensity of CsPbBr3 NFs increased with the increase of the diameter of the monolayer sphere, while the (001) peak intensity was suppressed greatly, indicating the more preferred (110) oriented growth. The PDs based on (110)-orientation-preferred CsPbBr3 NFs prepared by using 850 nm PS spheres showed the best performance.

The accurate dispersion curve from 3-D piezoelectric theory indicates that the operating TSh mode could couple to the flexural mode, which influences the performance of a sensing resonator and needs to be eliminated through the so-called frequency spectrum analysis. Frequency spectra of coupling vibration in this FBAR can be obtained by substituting the displacement solutions consisting of the mode branches in the dispersion curve into several weak boundary conditions, which gives the integral boundary conditions across the plate thickness at the side edge of FBARs. The results show that the content of mode couplings to spurious modes depends on the plate length/thickness ratios.

After the nasal dorsum was opened in all groups, 1 mm tissue under the skin in radix region was taken as punch biopsy. In the first group (classical group, n\u200a=\u200a 15), the cartilage hump was resected with number 15 scalpel and the bone hump with the help of a chisel. Lateral and median osteotomies were conducted using 4 mm sharp osteotomes. Rasping was performed to dorsum to correct bone deformities. Then, 1 mm punch biopsy was taken from under the skin tissue of the nose back near the radix. In the second group (piezo group, n\u200a=\u200a15) hump excision, osteotomies and rasping were performed by piezoelectric surgery. Then, 1 mm punch biopsy was taken from the subcutaneous tissue of the nose back near the radix. Biopsies were examined histopathologically in the light microscope for edema, necrosis, and inflammation.\nOf the 30 patients presented in this series, 21 were female and 9 were male.

{"title": "Five miRNAs-mediated PIEZO2 downregulation, accompanied with activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway, predicts poor prognosis of breast cancer.", "abstract": "Roles of Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2) in cancer remain largely unknown. Herein, we explored PIEZO2 expression, prognosis and underlying mechanisms in cancer. Breast was selected as the candidate as its relatively higher expression level of PIEZO2 than other human tissues. Next, we identified a decreased expression of PIEZO2 in breast cancer compared with normal controls, and found that PIEZO2 expression positively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status but negatively correlated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) score, Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, basal-like and triple-negative status. Subsequent analysis revealed that high expression of PIEZO2 had a favorable prognosis in breast cancer. 182 miRNAs were predicted to target PIEZO2. Among these miRNAs, five miRNAs (miR-130b-3p, miR-196a-5p, miR-301a-3p, miR-421 and miR-454-3p) possess the greatest potential in targeting PIEZO2. 109 co-expressed genes of PIEZO2 were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that these genes were enriched in Hedgehog signaling pathway, including Cell adhesion molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes (CDON). CDON expression was decreased in breast cancer and downregulation of CDON indicated a poor prognosis.

The metabolic response of these cells to this polymer, extensively used in bone regeneration strategies, may potentially translate into useful markers indicative of in vivo biomaterial performance. We present preliminary results of multivariate and univariate analysis of NMR spectra, which have shown the complementarity of lysed cells and extracts in terms of information on cell metabolome, and unveil that, irrespective of poling state, PLLA-grown cells seem to experience enhanced oxidative stress and activated energy metabolism, at the cost of storage lipids and glucose. Possible changes in protein and nucleic acid metabolisms were also suggested, as well as enhanced membrane biosynthesis. Therefore, the presence of PLLA seems to trigger cell catabolism and anti-oxidative protective mechanisms in HOb cells, while directing them towards cellular growth. This was not sufficient, however, to lead to a visible cell proliferation enhancement in the presence of PLLA, although a qualitative tendency for negatively poled PLLA to be more effective in sustaining cell growth than non-poled PLLA was suggested. These preliminary results indicate the potential of NMR metabolomics in enlightening cell metabolism in response to biomaterials and their properties, justifying further studies of the fine effects of poled PLLA on these and other cells of significance in tissue regeneration strategies.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in chemistry : MRC", "date": "2019-05-07", "authors": ["RitaAra\u00fajo", "Tatiana JCarneiro", "PaulaMarinho", "Marisa Maltezda Costa", "AnaRoque", "Odete A Bda Cruz E Silva", "Maria HelenaFernandes", "Paula MVilarinho", "Ana MGil"], "doi": "10.1002/mrc.4883"}
{"title": "Imaging Performance for Two Row-Column Arrays.", "abstract": "This study evaluates the volumetric imaging performance of two prototyped 62 + 62 row-column-addressed (RCA) 2-D array transducer probes using three synthetic aperture imaging (SAI) emission sequences and two different beamformers. The probes are fabricated using capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) and piezoelectric transducer (PZT) technology. Both have integrated apodization to reduce ghost echoes and are designed with similar acoustical features, i.e., 3-MHz center frequency, \u03bb /2 pitch, and [Formula: see text] active footprint. Raw RF data are obtained using an experimental research ultrasound scanner, SARUS. The SAI sequences are designed for imaging down to 14 cm at a volume rate of 88 Hz. Two beamforming methods, spatial matched filtering and row-column adapted delay-and-sum, are used for beamforming the RF data. The imaging quality is investigated through simulations and phantom measurements. Both probes on average have similar lateral full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values, but the PZT probe has 20% smaller cystic resolution values and 70% larger contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) compared to the capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) probe.

{"title": "Histological evaluation of combined platelet-rich fibrin membrane and piezo-incision application in orthodontic tooth movement.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane on tooth movement in comparison with shunt control and piezoelectric surgery. Sixteen White Vienna rabbits were included in the study and divided into two groups. Reciprocal forces (20\u2009g) were applied on the maxillary incisors by an orthodontic appliance. In group 1, PRF membrane was placed sub-periosteally on the distal alveolar bone surface of the right central incisors and the left side was kept as control. In group 2, piezo-incisions 3\u2009mm in depth were performed and combined with PRF membrane on the distal alveolar bone surface of the right central incisors, while the left side was kept as control. All rabbits were euthanized on day 21 and bilateral alveolar bone segments from the distal regions were removed for histological evaluation.

In the OT-PC group, the inflammatory process was evaluated by quantifying cytokines in the gingival crevicular fluid. A calibrated examiner measured the probing depth (PD), the distance between the gingival margin and the cementoenamel junction (GM-CEJ), and the clinical attachment level (CAL), before and after OT-PC. The presence of gingival scars was evaluated. Bone and root injuries were assessed with the use of cone-beam computed tomography.\nThe treatment time was significantly reduced in the OT-PC group for PBA in both maxilla (45%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and mandible (31%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.023), as well as for overall treatment (52%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

{"title": "Miniaturised acoustofluidic tactile haptic actuator.", "abstract": "Tactile haptic feedback is an important consideration in the design of advanced human-machine interfaces, particularly in an age of increasing reliance on automation and artificial intelligence. In this work, we show that the typical nanometer-order surface displacement amplitudes of piezoelectric transducers-which are too small to be detectable by the human touch, and constitute a significant constraint in their use for tactile haptic surface actuation-can be circumvented by coupling the vibration into a liquid to drive the deflection of a thermoplastic membrane. In particular, transmission of the sound energy from the standing wave vibration generated along a piezoelectric transducer into a microfluidic chamber atop which the membrane is attached is observed to amplify the mechanical vibration signalling through both the acoustic radiation pressure and the viscous normal stress acting on the membrane-the latter arising due to the acoustic streaming generated as the sound wave propagates through the liquid-to produce 100 \u03bcm-order static deflections of the membrane, upon which approximately 0.5 \u03bcm dynamic vibrations at frequencies around 1 kHz are superimposed; both these static and dynamic responses are within the perception range for human finger sensation.

{"title": "Improved ultrasonic interferometer technique for propagation velocity and attenuation measurement in liquids.", "abstract": "Propagation velocity and attenuation are the two basic parameters used for the ultrasonic investigations of liquids. An ultrasonic interferometer is a widely used tool as a cost effective solution for propagation velocity measurement. The ultrasonic attenuation measurements are not possible using the existing interferometers commercially available in the market. Ultrasonic attenuation can be measured using the pulse echo method, which is relatively complex and expensive. Generally, in interferometers, a radio frequency voltage of more than 100 V is used to excite the piezoelectric transducer. In this article, an improved design of the ultrasonic interferometer with low (5 V) rf voltage excitation is discussed. The proposed design has several advantages over existing systems. The low voltage excitation reduces heating of the sample under study. Detection of the received signal is done directly at the transducer. The critical effects of a coaxial cable in rf detection are minimized by dc detection at the transducer node. The impedance response of the transducer is used for the detection of nodes and antinodes for attenuation and velocity measurements. The use of an instrumentation amplifier enables one to amplify the extremely small voltage changes across the transducer due to interference. The developed method has the capability to measure attenuation due to high receiver sensitivity. The technique has been validated for the propagation velocity and attenuation measurement in standard samples of water and other liquids. The results thus obtained have been compared with the literature and the conventional pulse echo technique which shows close agreement.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-05-03", "authors": ["SahilSharma", "Ujjwal KMishra", "SanjayYadav", "P KDubey"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5088762"}
{"title": "Model reference adaptive damping control for a nanopositioning stage with load uncertainties.", "abstract": "In this paper, a scheme of model reference adaptive integral resonant control (MRAIRC) is presented for adaptive precision motion control of a piezo-actuated nanopositioning platform. The major advantage of the proposed scheme lies in the adaptivity for dynamic changes resulting from load uncertainties. Existing standard integral resonant control (IRC) with constant controller gains is normally designed based on the identified system model under no external load. For the proposed MRAIRC, a standard IRC is first designed using an analytical approach, assuming that a second-order system model is obtained in advance. Afterwards, the designed closed-loop is utilized as a reference model for systems with model uncertainties. The adaptive laws of the controller gains are determined according to the well-known MIT rules. An offline trail-and-error operation is conducted for adaption gains' tuning. The stability of this adaptive control system is proved through Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed MRAIRC is superior to the standard IRC in terms of the tracking errors for commonly used raster scanning signals at 5, 10, and 20 Hz with load variations of the platform ranging from 0 to 1000 g.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-05-03", "authors": ["JieLing", "ZhaoFeng", "MinMing", "XiaohuiXiao"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5064722"}

{"title": "Toward Antibiofouling PVDF Membranes.", "abstract": "Membranes for biologically and biomedically related applications must be bioinert, that is, resist biofouling by proteins, human cells, bacteria, algae, etc. Hydrophobic materials such as polysulfone, polypropylene, or poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) are often chosen as matrix materials but their hydrophobicity make them prone to biofouling, which in turn limits their application in biological/biomedical fields. Here, we designed PVDF-based membranes by precipitation from the vapor phase and zwitterionized them in situ to reduce their propensity to biofouling. To achieve this goal, we used a copolymer containing phosphorylcholine groups. An in-depth physicochemical characterization revealed not only the controlled presence of the copolymer in the membrane but also that bicontinuous membranes could be formed. Membrane hydrophilicity was greatly improved, resulting in the mitigation of a variety of biofoulants: the attachment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus mutans, and platelets was reduced by 99.9, 99.9, and 98.9%, respectively. Besides, despite incubation in a plasma platelet-poor medium, rich in plasma proteins, a flux recovery ratio of 75% could be measured while it was only 40% with a hydrophilic commercial membrane of similar structure and physical properties. Similarly, the zwitterionic membrane severely mitigated biofouling by microalgae during their harvesting.

For a network of transducers, the damage can be detected in one detection cell based on the signals scattered by the damage, and then it can be quantitatively estimated by three detection stages using the outer tangent circle and least-squares methods. First, a single-stage damage detection method is carried out by exciting a transducer at the center of the detection cell to locate the damaged subcell. Then, the corner transducers are excited in the second and third stages of detection to improve the damage detection, especially the size estimation. The method does not require any baseline signal, and it only utilizes the same arrangement of transducers and the same data processing technique in all stages. The results from previous detection stages contribute to the improvement of damage detection in the subsequent stages.

{"title": "Formation mechanisms of ZnO nanowires on polycrystalline Au seed layers for piezoelectric applications.", "abstract": "ZnO nanowires are considered as attractive building blocks for piezoelectric devices, including nano-generators and stress/strain sensors. However, their integration requires the use of metallic seed layers, on top of which the formation mechanisms of ZnO nanowires by chemical bath deposition are still largely open. In order to tackle that issue, the nucleation and growth mechanisms of ZnO nanowires on top of Au seed layers with a thickness in the range of 5-100 nm are thoroughly investigated. We show that the ZnO nanowires present two different populations of nano-objects with a given morphology. The majority primary population is made of vertically aligned ZnO nanowires, which are heteroepitaxially formed on top of the Au (111) grains. The resulting epitaxial strain is found to be completely relieved at the Au/ZnO interface. In contrast, the minority secondary population is composed of ZnO nanowires with a significant mean tilt angle around 20\u00b0 with respect to the normal to the substrate surface, which are presumably formed on the (211) facets of the Au (111) grains. The elongation of ZnO nanowires is further found to be limited by the surface reaction at the c-plane top facet in the investigated conditions. By implementing the selective area growth using electron beam lithography, the position of ZnO nanowires is controlled, but the two populations still co-exist in the ensemble. These findings provide an in-depth understanding of the formation mechanisms of ZnO nanowires on metallic seed layers, which should be taken into account for their more efficient integration into piezoelectric devices.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2019-04-30", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mentLausecker", "BassemSalem", "XavierBaillin", "Herv\u00e9Roussel", "EiriniSarigiannidou", "FranckBassani", "EstelleAppert", "S\u00e9bastienLabau", "VincentConsonni"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ab1d6e"}

However, the mechanisms of fouling are complex because of the deformability and potential for coalescence and break-up of the oil droplets. Here, we report for the first time direct, three-dimensional (3D) visualization of oil droplets on electrospun fiber microfiltration membranes after a period of membrane-based separation of oil-in-water emulsions. High-resolution 3D images were acquired by a dual-channel confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) technique in which both the fibers and the oil (dodecane) were fluorescently labeled. The morphology of dodecane as the foulant was observed for two different types of fibers, an oleophobic nylon (PA6(3)T), and oleophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Through direct visualization, the rejected oil was found to form droplets of clam-shell shape on the PA6(3)T fibers, whereas the oil tended to wet the PVDF fibers and spread across the membrane. The morphology was also analyzed as a function of separation time (i.e., \"4D\" imaging), as the oil accumulated within and upon the membranes. The observations are qualitatively consistent with a transition from blocking of individual pores in the membrane to coalescence of oil droplets into coherent liquid films with increasing filtration time. Analysis of permeate flux using blocking filtration models corroborate the transition of fouling modes indicated by the 3D images.

{"title": "Agonist-induced Piezo1 activation suppresses migration of transformed fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Increased migratory, invasive and metastatic potential is one of the main pathophysiological determinants of malignant cells. Mechanosensitive calcium-permeable ion channels are among the key membrane proteins that participate in processes of cellular motility. Local calcium influx via mechanosensitive channels was proposed to regulate calcium-dependent molecules involved in cell migration. Piezo transmembrane proteins were shown to act as calcium-permeable mechanosensitive ion channels in various cells and tissues, including a number of tumor cells. Furthermore, an elevated expression of Piezo1 is correlated with poor prognosis for some types of cancers. At the same time, functional impact of Piezo1 channels on pathophysiological reactions of tumor cells remains largely unknown. Here, we used 3T3B-SV40 mouse fibroblasts as a model to study the effect of Yoda1, selective Piezo1 activator, on migrative properties of transformed cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining showed the presence of native Piezo1 in 3T3B-SV40 fibroblasts. Functional expression of Piezo1 in plasma membrane of 3T3B-SV40\u202fcells was confirmed by calcium measurements and single channel patch-clamp analysis. Particularly, application of Yoda1 resulted in rapid calcium influx and induced typical channel activity in membrane patches with characteristics identical to stretch-activated channels in 3T3B-SV40\u202fcells. Importantly, dose-dependent inhibition of cellular migration by Yoda1 was found in wound healing assay using live cell imaging. Consistently, microscopic analysis showed that Yoda1 significantly altered cellular morphology, induced F-actin assembly and stress fiber formation indicating partial reversion of transformed phenotype. The results demonstrate for the first time that Piezo1 activation by selective agonist Yoda1 could be favorable for inhibiting migrative potential of transformed cells with native Piezo1 expression.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2019-04-29", "authors": ["Vladislav IChubinskiy-Nadezhdin", "Valeria YVasileva", "Irina OVassilieva", "Anastasia VSudarikova", "Elena AMorachevskaya", "Yuri ANegulyaev"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.04.139"}

The proposed assay features an array of four polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes impregnated with cationic poly (3-alkoxy-4-methylthiophene) (PT) as an optical reporter. The sensing strategy is based on monitoring the changes in optical properties of PT, upon complexation with target nucleic acids in the presence and in the absence of their corresponding complementary peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). As a proof of concept, the proposed methodology is validated using two biomarkers; lung cancer associated microRNA (mir21) and hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA). The flow-through colorimetric assay enabled detection of mir21 and HBV-DNA in plasma without requiring tedious sample pre-treatment and clean up protocols. Colorimetric responses for mir21 and HBV-DNA were obtained at nanomolar concentrations over five orders of magnitudes (from 1\u202fnM to 10\u202f\u03bcM), with a limit of detection of \u223c0.6\u202fnM and \u223c2\u202fnM in DI water and plasma, respectively.

However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite.

The importance of the damage detection system constituents (sensors number, localization, or damage index) in different levels of analysis was verified and discussed to emphasize that in many practical applications introducing complicated procedures and sophisticated data processing techniques does not lead to improving the damage detection efficiency.

This study introduces a built-in electric field in a one-component nanosheet to promote photo-generated carrier separation. For this reason, CdS nanosheets with both photocatalytic and piezoelectric properties were selected as research objects. The combination of these two properties renders CdS an excellent candidate for efficiently utilizing both light and vibrational energy for photocatalytic water splitting, without the need for coupling it to other materials or using an external bias.

However, under different light illumination conditions, the piezo-phototronic effect would have different effects on the optoelectronic performance due to the different photo-generated carrier excitation regions. Here, the piezo-phototronic effect is utilized to modulate the carrier transport behavior of a p-Si/n-CdS heterojunction PD during the optoelectronic process in a broadband range from visible to near-infrared light. The strain-induced piezo-charges significantly improve the photoresponse performance of the heterojunction PD. The photoresponsivity increases by 1867% under -0.35\u2030 strain under 808 nm light illumination, with a remarkable reduction in the rise and fall times to \u223c2.1 ms (reduced by 83.3% and 50.0%, respectively).

{"title": "Plasma functional polymerization of dopamine using atmospheric pressure plasma and a dopamine solution mist.", "abstract": "By using DBD-type atmospheric pressure plasmas and a dopamine solution mist formed by a piezoelectric module, the possibility of depositing functional polymer films showing the physical and chemical characteristics of polydopamine without breaking the functional group of the dopamine has been investigated for different plasma voltages. The higher DBD voltages up to 3.0 kV decreased the functional groups such as catechol and amine (N/C ratio) relative to dopamine in the deposited polymer by increasing the dissociation of dopamine into atoms and small molecules due to higher electron energies. In contrast, the lower DBD voltages up to 1.5 kV increased the functional group and N/C ratio of dopamine in the deposited polymer by keeping the molecular structures of the dopamine due to lower electron energies. Therefore, the polymer deposited at the lower DBD voltages showed lower contact angles and higher metal absorption properties which are some of the surface modification characteristics of polydopamine. When the metal absorption properties of the polydopamine-like film deposited using the atmospheric pressure plasma of a low DBD voltage with a dopamine solution mist were compared with other metal absorbers for Cu, As, and Cr, the polydopamine-like film exhibited superior metal absorption properties. It is believed that this atmospheric pressure plasma process can be also applied to the plasma polymerization of other monomers without breaking the functional groups of the monomers.", "journal": "RSC advances", "date": "2019-04-25", "authors": ["Mu KyeomMun", "Yun JongJang", "Ju EunKim", "Geun YoungYeom", "Dong WooKim"], "doi": "10.1039/c8ra10391g\n10.1126/science.1147241\n10.1080/08927014.2011.600830\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.12.020\n10.1021/am300058j\n10.1021/bi3002538\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.12.059\n10.1039/C3TA10623C\n10.1016/j.bios.2016.12.043\n10.1002/ange.201510724\n10.1002/adma.201403709\n10.1039/C7PY00805H\n10.1039/C2JM15665B\n10.1021/jo01020a058\n10.1002/ppap.201100038\n10.1016/j.tsf.2012.01.026\n10.1021/la204831b\n10.1002/adfm.201200177\n10.1021/bm400352d\n10.1140/epjd/e2010-00245-x\n10.1163/156856101753207733\n10.1039/C0CC03700A\n10.1039/C4TB00155A\n10.1166/jnn.2015.11285\n10.1002/ppap.201500222\n10.1088/1009-0630/18/1/08\n10.3390/coatings7120208\n10.1016/S0378-5173(98)00370-6\n10.1021/ie50498a023\n10.1063/1.1371268\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2006.12.083\n10.1016/0379-6779(88)90261-5\n10.1002/pola.1989.080270409\n10.1038/srep18162\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2010.03.132\n10.6028/jres.119.018"}
{"title": "Permanently hydrophilic, piezoelectric PVDF nanofibrous scaffolds promoting unaided electromechanical stimulation on osteoblasts.", "abstract": "Biomimetic functional scaffolds for tissue engineering should fulfil specific requirements concerning structural, bio-chemical and electro-mechanical characteristics, depending on the tissue that they are designed to resemble. In bone tissue engineering, piezoelectric materials based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) are on the forefront, due to their inherent ability to generate surface charges under minor mechanical deformations. Nevertheless, PVDF's high hydrophobicity hinders sufficient cell attachment and expansion, which are essential in building biomimetic scaffolds. In this study, PVDF nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning to achieve high piezoelectricity, which was compared with drop-cast membranes, as it was confirmed by XRD and FTIR measurements. Oxygen plasma treatment of the PVDF surface rendered it hydrophilic, and surface characterization revealed a long-term stability. XPS analysis and contact angle measurements confirmed an unparalleled two-year stability of hydrophilicity. Osteoblast cell culture on the permanently hydrophilic PVDF scaffolds demonstrated better cell spreading over the non-treated ones, as well as integration into the scaffold as indicated by SEM cross-sections. Intracellular calcium imaging confirmed a higher cell activation on the piezoelectric electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds. Combining these findings, and taking advantage of the self-stimulation of the cells due to their attachment on the piezoelectric PVDF nanofibers, a 3D tissue-like functional self-sustainable scaffold for bone tissue engineering was fabricated.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-04-25", "authors": ["MariaKitsara", "AndreuBlanquer", "GonzaloMurillo", "VincentHumblot", "SaraDe Bragan\u00e7a Vieira", "CarmeNogu\u00e9s", "ElenaIb\u00e1\u00f1ez", "JaumeEsteve", "LeonardoBarrios"], "doi": "10.1039/c8nr10384d"}

A popular feature extraction method, partial least squares regression, is utilised to predict the gaps.

A piezoelectric actuator generates a sine burst signal, which propagates along the metal and is received by a piezoelectric sensor. The partial least squares regression is performed on the raw sensor signal to extract features and to determine the relationship between the signal and the gap size, which is then used to predict the gaps. The applicability of the developed system is tested on two concrete-metal composite specimens. The first specimen consisted of an aluminium plate and the second specimen consisted of a steel plate.

A pair of parallel drive electrodes are symmetrically placed on the surface of the vertical bar for driving the oscillating mass. A serpentine sense electrode is placed on the lateral bar. When the gyroscope is oscillating in drive mode, charges with equal quantity and opposite sign will be polarized and distributed symmetrically along the lateral bar. These charges neutralize each other at the sense electrode. Therefore, no coupling signals can be detected from the sense electrode. This design can realize the decoupling between the drive mode and sense mode. In this work, the T-shape decoupled structure was designed as the key component of an AlN piezoelectric gyroscope and the whole structure was simulated by COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a.

{"title": "Looseness Monitoring of Bolted Spherical Joint Connection Using Electro-Mechanical Impedance Technique and BP Neural Networks.", "abstract": "The bolted spherical joint (BSJ) has wide applications in various space grid structures. The bar and the bolted sphere are connected by the high-strength bolt inside the joint. High-strength bolt is invisible outside the joint, which causes the difficulty in monitoring the bolt looseness. Moreover, the bolt looseness leads to the reduction of the local stiffness and bearing capacity for the structure. In this regard, this study used the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique and back propagation neural networks (BPNNs) to monitor the bolt looseness inside the BSJ. Therefore, a space grid specimen having bolted spherical joints and tubular bars was considered for experimental evaluation. Different torques levels were applied on the sleeve to represent different looseness degrees of joint connection. As the torque levels increased, the looseness degrees of joint connection increased correspondingly. The lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch was used and integrated with the tubular bar due to its strong piezoelectric effect. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the conductance signatures for the PZT patch were used as the looseness-monitoring indexes. Taking RMSD values of sub-frequency bands and the looseness degrees as inputs and outputs respectively, the BPNNs were trained and tested in twenty repeated experiments. The experimental results show that the formation of the bolt looseness can be detected according to the changes of looseness-monitoring indexes, and the degree of bolt looseness by the trained BPNNs. Overall, this research demonstrates that the proposed structural health monitoring (SHM) technique is feasible for monitoring the looseness of bolted spherical connection in space grid structures.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-04-25", "authors": ["JingXu", "JinhuiDong", "HongnanLi", "ChunweiZhang", "Siu ChunHo"], "doi": "10.3390/s19081906\n10.1177/1369433216682506\n10.1243/0954410011533356\n10.1177/1077546311421514\n10.3390/app7040362\n10.3390/s18061727\n10.1002/stc.1848\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6e93\n10.21595/jve.2016.17040\n10.1002/stc.1718\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115020\n10.3390/s150407172\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.07.032\n10.3390/app7020169\n10.3390/s17030657\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/11/115031\n10.3390/s18051591\n10.3390/app6110341\n10.3390/s17122880\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.3390/s17071641\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9dd0\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000632\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2660301\n10.3390/s18020671\n10.1080/10589759.2015.1058376\n10.1177/1045389X04039914\n10.3390/s18061782\n10.1177/1475921705049752\n10.1115/1.2930387\n10.1177/1475921717703053\n10.1088/1361-665X/aabaaf\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095003\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/4/045003\n10.1088/0964-1726/26/1/015003\n10.3390/s8010271\n10.1177/104538902761696733\n10.1177/1475921717725028\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/01/015005\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2855693\n10.3390/app7010015\n10.1177/1045389X08088664\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa785f\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa931b\n10.3390/s18093072\n10.1007/s00521-015-1950-8\n10.1016/j.neucom.2013.09.050\n10.3390/app6100298\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.3390/s16101765\n10.3390/s18103524\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/3/033001\n10.3390/s19030558\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2790902\n10.12989/sem.2016.58.2.347\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000904\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaeb73\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.2.375\n10.3390/s17020250\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6a8e\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000900\n10.1155/2013/871213\n10.3390/app6110320\n10.3390/s16091429\n10.1177/1077546309103284\n10.3390/s17122897\n10.1177/1045389X9500600117\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/2/025010\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9a65\n10.1088/1361-665X/26/2/025033\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/8/087001"}
{"title": "Webvision: The Organization of the Retina and Visual System", "abstract": "Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the world, can be challenging to diagnose because symptoms often appear at late stage of the disease, and challenging to treat because of the irreversible loss of retinal neurons. The term encompasses a heterogenous group of diseases that are characterized by altered biomechanics of anterior and posterior eye. These diseases tend to manifest as stiffening of the trabecular meshwork and increased production/reduced drainage of aqueous humor, together with retinal inflammation associated with activated microglia, M\u00fcller cells and astrocytes, and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. In general, the phenotype is caused by a conjunction of risk factors such as age, family history, ethnic origin, high myopia, vascular disease and intraocular pressure (IOP). Current treatments are limited to lowering and stabilizing IOP, indicating that glaucoma is principally a disease of ocular mechanotransduction. Although the events that lead from IOP elevations to ganglion cell damage are not well defined, a body of recent work has pointed at mechanotransducing TRPV4, piezo and TREK-1 channels and immune mechanisms as key pressure targets in trabecular meshwork, ciliary body, retinal ganglion, endothelial cells and glia. Data indicate that dysfunctions of mechanotransduction mechanisms within the ganglion cell soma-dendrite, M\u00fcller cells and microglia may precede axonal degeneration, cupping of the optic nerve head and visual field damage which over the years have represented the golden standard of glaucoma diagnosis. Collectively, these recent studies predict the development of new therapies and diagnostic strategies to be contingent upon systematic delineation of molecular mechanisms that sense and transduce pressure in the eye. Thus, neuroprotection, a currently elusive goal, may be achieved via parallel suppression of pressure sensing in the anterior eye, retinal neurons, blood vessels and glia in order to achieve normalization of neuron-glia-blood vessel interactions, and the attendant reduction in immune activation.", "journal": NaN, "date": "1995", "authors": ["HelgaKolb", "EduardoFernandez", "RalphNelson", "DavidKri\u017eaj"], "doi": null}

Here, we demonstrate an original strategy to operate the lasing mode shift through reversible length changes of a CdS nanobelt, which is determined by the direction of piezoelectric polarization. The relationships between the direction of applied strain, the lasing mode shift, and the tunable effective refractive index are elaborated in detail. The correlation between the piezoelectric polarization-induced lasing mode red shift and the blue shift in the wavelength of the lasing mode output caused by the Poisson effect is discussed in depth, as well. Our study comprehensively considers the influence of both the cavity size variations and refractive index changes on the control of the lasing mode and provides a deeper understanding of the strain-induced lasing mode shift.", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2019-04-24", "authors": ["WendaMa", "JunfengLu", "ZhengYang", "DengfengPeng", "FangtaoLi", "YiyaoPeng", "QiushuoChen", "JunluSun", "JianguoXi", "CaofengPan"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.9b01735"}

The resulting aerogel-foam composites possess both excellent compression-resilience performance and stable piezo-resistive properties due, respectively, to the excellent mechanical properties of polyurethane foams and to the presence of a chitosan-based aerogel loaded with rGO. The latter, indeed, provides outstanding electrical properties due to its conductive and parallel flat lamellar structure. It has been proven that both mechanical and piezo-resistive properties are stable even after 1000 loading/unloading cycles and a reduction of the electrical resistance of about 86% is observed upon the application of a 60% strain. The high sensitivity, long cycling life, and reliable performance over a wide strain range make this unique anisotropic aerogel-foam composite a highly promising candidate for the production of wearable sensors and healthcare monitoring devices.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-04-24", "authors": ["TianliangZhai", "LetiziaVerdolotti", "SauliusKacilius", "PierfrancescoCerruti", "GennaroGentile", "HeshengXia", "MariameliaStanzione", "Giovanna GiulianaBuonocore", "MarinoLavorgna"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr00157c"}

{"title": "Optimization of a Piezoelectric Energy Harvester and Design of a Charge Pump Converter for CMOS-MEMS Monolithic Integration.", "abstract": "The increasing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the rapid development of low-power sensors and wireless networks. However, there are still several barriers that make a global deployment of the IoT difficult. One of these issues is the energy dependence, normally limited by the capacitance of the batteries. A promising solution to provide energy autonomy to the IoT nodes is to harvest residual energy from ambient sources, such as motion, vibrations, light, or heat. Mechanical energy can be converted into electrical energy by using piezoelectric transducers. The piezoelectric generators provide an alternating electrical signal that must be rectified and, therefore, needs a power management circuit to adapt the output to the operating voltage of the IoT devices. The bonding and packaging of the different components constitute a large part of the cost of the manufacturing process of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and integrated circuits. This could be reduced by using a monolithic integration of the generator together with the circuitry in a single chip. In this work, we report the optimization, fabrication, and characterization of a vibration-driven piezoelectric MEMS energy harvester, and the design and simulation of a charge-pump converter based on a standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Finally, we propose combining MEMS and CMOS technologies to obtain a fully integrated system that includes the piezoelectric generator device and the charge-pump converter circuit without the need of external components.

Eighty implant sites were prepared in custom-made solid rigid polyurethane blocks with two different low cancellous bone densities (5 or 15 pounds per cubic foot, PCF), equally distributed between piezoelectric (Surgysonic Moto, Esacrom, Italy) and conventional drilling techniques. Two short implant systems (Prama and Syra, Sweden & Martina) were tested by inserting 40 fixtures of each system (both 6.0 mm length and 5.0 mm diameter), divided in the four subgroups (drills/5 PCF density; drills/15 PCF density; piezo/5 PCF density; piezo/15 PCF density). Insertion torque (Ncm), implant stability quotient values, removal torque (Ncm) and surgical time were recorded. Data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA and Scheff\u00e9's test (\u03b1=0.05). With slight variations among the considered dependent variables, overall high primary implant stability was observed across all subgroups. Piezoelectric instrumentation allowed for comparable or slightly superior primary stability in comparison with the drilling procedures in both implant systems.

{"title": "Investigations of ferroelectric polycrystalline bulks and thick films using piezoresponse force microscopy.", "abstract": "In recent years, ferroelectric/piezoelectric polycrystalline bulks and thick films have been extensively studied for different applications, such as sensors, actuators, transducers and caloric devices. In the majority of these applications, the electric field is applied to the working element in order to induce an electromechanical response, which is a complex phenomenon with several origins. Among them is the field-induced movement of domain walls, which is nowadays extensively studied using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), a technique derived from atomic force microscopy. PFM is based on the detection of the local converse piezoelectric effect in the sample; it is one of the most frequently applied methods for the characterization of the ferroelectric domain structure due to the simplicity of the sample preparation, its non-destructive nature and its relatively high imaging resolution.

Insulin retained its stability throughout device fabrication and during in vitro release in simulated intestinal conditions. Insulin release kinetics, from burst release to no release, can be tailored by controlling the blend of the Eudragit capping material.\nThis approach represents a uniquely scalable and flexible strategy for microdevice fabrication that overcomes limitations in loading sensitive biologics and in the tuneability of device geometries that are inherent to traditional microfabrication strategies.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical research", "date": "2019-04-21", "authors": ["Cameron LNemeth", "William RLykins", "HuyenTran", "Mohamed E HElSayed", "Tejal ADesai"], "doi": "10.1007/s11095-019-2618-3"}

{"title": "Acoustic Bubble Suppression by Constructing a Hydrophilic Coating on HDPE Surface.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic bubbles on the solid surface of various sonochemical devices largely affect signal resolution due to the serious reflection/scattering of sound waves. The Laplace pressure of the cavitation bubble can be tuned by constructing an ultrathin hydrophilic layer, which leads to the solvation or pinching off of the bubbles from the surface. In this article, we successfully coated a polydopamine polymer layer on the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) surface. The formed hydrophilic layer with a contact angle of less than 45\u00b0 almost completely eliminates the bubbles in both water and 32.5 vol % diesel exhaust fluid solutions upon sonication, which results in the operation of the piezoelectric sensor over 500 h, while the sensor with pure HDPE only ran for less than 2 h. Further, the coated sensors showed high stability under the temperatures of 60-80 \u00b0C. An improved mechanical property was confirmed via abrasion test, enabling long-term stability in harsh environments, including acidic urine and ultrasonic agitation. The acoustic bubble suppression via the hydrophilic polymer coating on HDPE surface displays broad applications, particularly with acoustic sensors, sonobuoys, and nondestructive surface detection in sonochemistry.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-04-20", "authors": ["YuemeiYe", "StanislavKlimchuk", "MingweiShang", "KennethMcDonald", "JunjieNiu"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b04038"}

The potential capability of harvesting mechanical energy and delivering to system load is demonstrated by integrating the device into a fully integrated power management system. The theory for determining the harvested energy that is ultimately delivered to external electronic loads (or stored in a battery) is discussed.

Here, an ink formulation is developed with only 10 wt% of polymers, which can bind a 90 wt% nanothermite using a simple direct-writing approach. The key additive in the ink is a hybrid polymer of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) in which the former serves as an energetic initiator and a binder, and the latter is a thickening agent and the other binder, which can form a gel. The rheological shear-thinning properties of the ink are critical to making the formulation at such high loadings printable. The Young's modulus of the printed stick is found to compare favorably with that of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), with a particle packing density at the theoretical maximum. The linear burn rate, mass burn rate, flame temperature, and heat flux are found to be easily adjusted by varying the fuel/oxidizer ratio.

However, their application is limited because of high processing temperature, brittleness, lack of conformal deposition and, more importantly, intrinsic incompatibility with biological environments. Recent studies on bioorganic piezoelectrics have demonstrated their potential in these applications, essentially due to using the same building blocks as those used by nature. In this work, we used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to study the domain structures and polarization reversal in the smallest amino acid glycine, which recently attracted a lot of attention due to its strong shear piezoelectric activity. In this uniaxial ferroelectric, a diverse domain structure that includes both 180\u00b0 and charged domain walls was observed, as well as domain wall kinks related to peculiar growth and crystallographic structure of this material. Local polarization switching was studied by applying a bias voltage to the PFM tip, and the possibility to control the resulting domain structure was demonstrated.

{"title": "Enhanced Shock Scattering Histotripsy With Pseudomonopolar Ultrasound Pulses.", "abstract": "Shock scattering histotripsy involves a complex interaction between positive and negative phases of an acoustic burst to initiate a robust cavitation bubble cloud. To more precisely study these effects and optimize shock scattering histotripsy therapy, we constructed a frequency compounding transducer to generate pseudomonopolar ultrasound pulses. The transducer consisted of 113 individual piezoelectric elements with various resonant frequencies (250 kHz, 500 kHz, 750 kHz, 1 MHz, 1.5 MHz, 2 MHz, and 3 MHz). For each resonant frequency, an extremely short pulse could be generated. Pseudomonopolar peak positive pulses were generated by aligning the principal peak positive pressures of individual frequency components temporally, so that they added constructively, and destructive interference occurred outside the peak-positive-overlapped temporal window. After inverting the polarity of the excitation signals, pseudomonopolar peak negative pulses were generated similarly by aligning principal peak negative pressures. Decoupling the positive and negative acoustic phases could have significant advantages for therapeutic applications enhancing precision and avoiding cavitation at tissue interfaces by using mostly positive pressure pulses. For example, we show that 16 shock scattering bubble clouds can be generated using only peak positive pulses following a single peak negative pulse that initiates a pressure release \"seed cloud\" from which the first shock front is \"scattered.\" Subsequent positive only pulses result in a precise elongated lesion within red blood cell phantoms.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-04-17", "authors": ["YigeLi", "Timothy LHall", "ZhenXu", "Charles ACain"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2911289"}

{"title": "Mutations in PIEZO2 contribute to Gordon syndrome, Marden-Walker syndrome and distal arthrogryposis: A bioinformatics analysis of mechanisms.", "abstract": "Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2) is a mechanically activated ion channel. Mutations in PIEZO2 may cause distal arthrogryposis 3 (DA3)/Gordon syndrome (GS), DA5, Marden-Walker syndrome (MWS) and associated diseases. To date, no systematic study has analyzed and compared the influence of different gene mutations of PIEZO2 on its transcription, as well as translation and protein function. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to systematically assess the effect of different pathological mutations of PIEZO2 on transcription, translation, as well as protein structure and function that contribute to GS/DA3, DA5, MWS and associated diseases based on a bioinformatics analysis using the Pubmed, ClinVar, RaptorX and Phyre2 online databases. The results indicated the presence of 27 pathological mutations in PIEZO2, including dominant and recessive mutations. Dominant mutations were mainly located in the C-terminal region, whereas recessive mutations were mainly localized in the N-terminal region, and most reported mutation sites exhibited high evolutionary conservation among different species. Loss-of-function mutations result in nonsense-mediated transcript decay or premature termination codons, consequently leading to a lack of PIEZO2 protein, whereas gain-of-function mutations may lead to increased PIEZO2-associated channel activity. The bioinformatics analysis results also indicated that the p.Ala1486Pro, p.Thr2221Ile and p.Glu2727del mutations modify the secondary structure of the PIEZO2 protein, while p.Thr2221Ile, p.Arg2718Leu and p.Arg2718Pro mutations reduce the solvent accessibility of PIEZO2 protein. Furthermore, the p.Ala1486Pro, p.Thr2221Ile, p.Ser2223Leu, p.Thr2356Met, p.Arg2686His, p.Arg2718Leu, p.Arg2718Pro and p.Glu2727del mutations affect the transmembrane region. These changes of PIEZO2 may contribute to a gain-of-function of PIEZO2. Variable clinical phenotypes were present between and among the gain- and loss-of-function mutations linked with PIEZO2-associated disease, which implied that different mutations in PIEZO2 have different pathophysiological effects. Of course, further functional studies to explore the precise structure and function of PIEZO2 are necessary and may offer useful clues for the prevention and treatment of associated diseases.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2019-04-17", "authors": ["YanboMa", "YantaoZhao", "ZhenCai", "XiuyanHao"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2019.7381\n10.1038/jhg.2016.153\n10.1002/ajmg.a.37997\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.09.019\n10.1002/ajmg.a.36881\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.015\n10.1073/pnas.1221400110\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1111/cge.12850\n10.1242/dev.151266\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1073/pnas.1414298111\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2016.11.002\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1002/humu.22792\n10.1002/ajmg.a.36822\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.04.006\n10.1093/nar/gkw306\n10.1038/nprot.2012.085\n10.1038/nprot.2015.053\n10.1016/j.cub.2014.05.011\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1113/JP274124"}

{"title": "Toward the Targeted Design of Molecular Ferroelectrics: Modifying Molecular Symmetries and Homochirality.", "abstract": "Although the first ferroelectric discovered in 1920 is Rochelle salt, a typical molecular ferroelectric, the front-runners that have been extensively studied and widely used in diverse applications, such as memory elements, capacitors, sensors, and actuators, are inorganic ferroelectrics with excellent electrical, mechanical, and optical properties. With the increased concerns about the environment, energy, and cost, molecular ferroelectrics are becoming promising supplements for inorganic ferroelectrics. The unique advantages of high structural tunability and homochirality, which are unavailable in their inorganic counterparts, make molecular systems a good platform for manipulating ferroelectricity. Remarkably, based on the Neumann's principle and the Curie symmetry principle defining the group-to-subgroup relationship, we have found some outstanding high-temperature molecular ferroelectrics, like diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB) with a large spontaneous polarization up to 23 \u03bcC/cm", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2019-04-16", "authors": ["Han-YueZhang", "Yuan-YuanTang", "Ping-PingShi", "Ren-GenXiong"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00677"}

New tools, such as the Rhinosculpture or piezoelectric motor are particularly useful in this context.

{"title": "Nitric oxide releasing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) films using a fluorinated nitric oxide donor to greatly decrease chemical leaching.", "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) releasing polymers have been widely applied as biomaterials for a variety of biomedical implants and devices. However, the chemical leaching of NO donors and their byproduct species is almost always observed during the application of polymers doped with NO donors, unless the donor is covalently linked to the polymer. Herein, we report the first NO releasing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) fluorinated copolymer prepared by incorporating a fluorinated S-nitrosothiol as the NO donor. Under physiological conditions, the resulting polymeric films can release NO for 16\u202fdays. Importantly, due to both fluorine-fluorine and electrostatic charge interactions between the fluorinated NO donor and the PVDF-HFP copolymer, the total chemical leaching of the fluorinated NO donor and its disulfide product after 9\u202fday was only 0.6% (mol%) of the initial amount of NO donor loaded into the film. These new NO release PVDF-HFP films exhibit antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities against both Gram positive S. aureus and Gram negative P. aeruginosa strains. The NO-releasing PVDF-HFP polymer can also be coated on Teflon tubing to release NO under physiological conditions for extended time periods. This NO-releasing PVDF-HFP copolymer with greatly reduced chemical leaching could help enhance the biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of various biomedical devices. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Fluoropolymers have been widely used in creating various biomedical implants and devices. However, nitric oxide (NO) release fluoropolymers have not been well studied to date. Additionally, in the application of biomaterials doped with NO donors, a significant amount of NO donors and their byproducts almost always leach into aqueous environment. We now report an NO releasing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) fluoropolymer by incorporating a new fluorinated S-nitrosothiol. The NO release can last for 16\u202fdays under physiological conditions. The total chemical leaching was determined to be only 0.6\u202fmol% of the initial S-nitrosothiol loaded.

However, the highest radiation efficiency antennas require size at the scale of the wavelength (here, >1\u2009km), making portable transmitters extremely challenging. Facilitating transmitters at the 10\u2009cm scale, we demonstrate an ultra-low loss lithium niobate piezoelectric electric dipole driven at acoustic resonance that radiates with greater than 300x higher efficiency compared to the previous state of the art at a comparable electrical size. A piezoelectric radiating element eliminates the need for large impedance matching networks as it self-resonates at the acoustic wavelength. Temporal modulation of this resonance demonstrates a device bandwidth greater than 83x beyond the conventional Bode-Fano limit, thus increasing the transmitter bitrate while still minimizing losses.

Membrane distillation offers a unique opportunity to utilize the substantial, but largely untapped geothermal brackish groundwater for desalination to lessen the stress. Two types of hydrophobic, microporous hollow fiber membranes (HFMs), including polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), were evaluated for their effectiveness in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). Water flux and salt rejection were measured as a function of module packing density and length in lab-scale systems. The PVDF HFMs generally exhibited higher water flux than the PTFE HFMs possibly due to thinner membrane wall and higher porosity. As the packing density or module length increased, water flux declined. The water production rate per module, however, increased due to the larger membrane surface area. A pilot-scale DCMD system was deployed to the 2nd largest geothermally-heated greenhouse in the United States for field testing over a duration of about 22 days.

{"title": "Vibration-Based In-Situ Detection and Quantification of Delamination in Composite Plates.", "abstract": "This paper presents a new methodology for detecting and quantifying delamination in composite plates based on the high-frequency local vibration under the excitation of piezoelectric wafer active sensors. Finite-element-method-based numerical simulations and experimental measurements were performed to quantify the size, shape, and depth of the delaminations. Two composite plates with purpose-built delaminations of different sizes and depths were analyzed. In the experiments, ultrasonic C-scan was applied to visualize the simulated delaminations. In this methodology, piezoelectric wafer active sensors were used for the high-frequency excitation with a linear sine wave chirp from 1 to 500 kHz and a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer was used to measure the local vibration response of the composite plates. The local defect resonance frequencies of delaminations were determined from scanning laser Doppler vibrometer measurements and the corresponding operational vibration shapes were measured and utilized to quantify the delaminations. Harmonic analysis of local finite element model at the local defect resonance frequencies demonstrated that the strong vibrations only occurred in the delamination region. It is shown that the effect of delamination depth on the detectability of the delamination was more significant than the size of the delamination.

{"title": "Conventional and Microwave Hydrothermal Synthesis and Application of Functional Materials: A Review.", "abstract": "With the continuous development and progress of materials science, increasingly more attention has been paid to the new technology of powder synthesis and material preparation. The hydrothermal method is a promising liquid phase preparation technology that has developed rapidly during recent years. It is widely used in many fields, such as the piezoelectric, ferroelectric, ceramic powder, and oxide film fields. The hydrothermal method has resulted in many new methods during the long-term research process, such as adding other force fields to the hydrothermal condition reaction system. These force fields mainly include direct current, electric, magnetic (autoclaves composed of non-ferroelectric materials), and microwave fields. Among them, the microwave hydrothermal method, as an extension of the hydrothermal reaction, cleverly uses the microwave temperature to compensate for the lack of temperature in the hydrothermal method, allowing better practical application. This paper reviews the development of the hydrothermal and microwave hydrothermal methods, introduces their reaction mechanisms, and focuses on the practical application of the two methods.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-04-14", "authors": ["GuijunYang", "Soo-JinPark"], "doi": "10.3390/ma12071177\n10.1039/B802654H\n10.1039/C5RA19621C\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-4095(199908)11:11<941::AID-ADMA941>3.0.CO;2-T\n10.1016/j.ssi.2007.10.012\n10.1039/C7TA08738A\n10.1039/C6TA07962H\n10.13005/ojc/310281\n10.1007/s10854-015-3395-3\n10.1016/j.electacta.2018.08.013\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.01.108\n10.3390/catal9020138\n10.3390/s18030701\n10.1021/jp9828179\n10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00903-X\n10.1186/s11671-014-0722-1\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.917.78\n10.1016/j.apt.2016.01.003\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2017.03.054\n10.3109/1040841X.2014.912200\n10.1063/1.365446\n10.1021/nl801827v\n10.1002/adma.201104798\n10.1021/nl803279t\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2014.12.040\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.08.008\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.01.130\n10.1016/j.jcis.2015.09.067\n10.1016/j.molliq.2015.11.015\n10.3390/app5030294\n10.1021/ja02198a600\n10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00037-X\n10.1016/j.physb.2008.06.020\n10.1016/S0022-0248(00)00065-8\n10.1107/S0365110X55001679\n10.1021/j100318a065\n10.1088/0953-8984/5/28/003\n10.1029/JZ069i004p00759\n10.1016/S0167-2738(99)00109-5\n10.1021/cm00052a010\n10.1016/j.jssc.2019.01.014\n10.1039/C7CE01827D\n10.1111/jace.16340\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1983.tb09958.x\n10.1063/1.4818139\n10.3390/ma9040231\n10.1023/A:1017900214477\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.044\n10.1016/S1359-835X(99)00020-2\n10.1504/IJNT.2016.074530\n10.1039/C4RA12917B\n10.1016/j.ssc.2007.11.033\n10.1016/j.powtec.2014.09.045\n10.1016/j.matdes.2016.08.035\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.08.321\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.01.140\n10.1080/21663831.2018.1477848\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.04.092\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.07.094\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.11.004\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.01.089\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.117\n10.1021/acsami.6b02893\n10.1016/j.jcis.2016.07.004\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.08.122\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.08.190\n10.1016/j.matlet.2016.01.004\n10.1016/j.matlet.2018.05.067\n10.1021/am504084p\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00456\n10.1016/0025-5408(92)90004-J\n10.1039/b200053a\n10.1016/j.matdes.2015.10.121\n10.1016/S0167-577X(02)01248-X\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2001.tb01084.x\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.01.157\n10.1016/j.matlet.2014.06.095\n10.1021/la0361767\n10.1002/adma.200306592\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.06.045\n10.1016/j.jcis.2011.12.013\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.003\n10.1021/ie0713644\n10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00474.x\n10.1039/c3ce27040h\n10.1007/s10971-016-4261-3\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.06.121\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.104\n10.1016/S0167-577X(98)00187-6\n10.1016/j.electacta.2018.12.140\n10.1007/s10853-012-6274-9\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2010.08.032\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.04.022\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.170\n10.1088/1742-6596/1027/1/012014\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.01.145\n10.1088/0953-2048/11/11/021\n10.1143/JJAP.29.2467\n10.1002/adma.200500726\n10.1016/j.jssc.2011.11.021\n10.1021/cm030542q\n10.1016/j.watres.2003.10.011\n10.1016/j.matlet.2015.09.048\n10.1016/j.jphotochem.2005.08.034\n10.1021/acsami.6b05700\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.12.125\n10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.098\n10.1016/j.apcata.2016.06.025\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.12.071\n10.1016/j.matlet.2009.01.075\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1962.tb11078.x\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.1997.tb03025.x\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2012.05.029\n10.1016/j.mssp.2015.02.056"}

In this work, by using micromagnetic simulation, we showed that localized strain-induced magnetic anisotropy caused by the electric field-induced piezostrain combined with strong multifold shape anisotropy effect can be used for achieving a multistate switching of magnetization in a triangular soft magnetic nano-island on a piezoelectric substrate. A piezostrain-induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy pulse applied in specific directions switches the magnetization within the triangular nanomagnet by an angle of 60\u00b0 from the initial state. The relation between critical magnitude of the strain pulse for the switching of the magnetization states and geometric parameters (thickness and lateral size) within the triangular nanomagnets has been worked out. Complete cycles of clockwise as well as counter-clockwise switching of the magnetization states of the triangular nanomagnet have been achieved by a series of sequential switching with different directions of applied strain-induced magnetic anisotropy. This local gating scheme-based multistate switching can be used for electric field-induced ultra-fast, deterministic and reversible magnetization switching which are the key challenges in designing of the magnetoelastic and/or magnetoelectric memory and logic devices.", "journal": "Journal of physics.

{"title": "Time-Periodic Stiffness Modulation in Elastic Metamaterials for Selective Wave Filtering: Theory and Experiment.", "abstract": "Elastic waveguides with time-modulated stiffness feature a frequency-periodic dispersion spectrum, where branches merge at multiple integers of half the modulation frequency and over a finite wave number range. In this range, frequency becomes complex, with its real part remaining constant. The vanishing group velocity associated with these flat bands leads to frequency-selective reflection at an interface between a nonmodulated medium and a time-modulated one, which converts a broadband input into a narrow-band output centered at the half modulation frequency. This behavior is illustrated in an elastic waveguide in transverse motion, where modulation is implemented experimentally by an array of piezoelectric patches shunted through a negative electrical capacitance controlled by a switching circuit. The switching schedule defines the modulation frequency and allows the selection of the output frequency. This implementation is suitable for the investigation of numerous properties of time-space modulated elastic metamaterials, such as nonreciprocity and one-way propagation, and can lead to the implementation of novel functionalities for acoustic wave devices operating on piezoelectric substrates.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2019-04-13", "authors": ["GiuseppeTrainiti", "YiweiXia", "JacopoMarconi", "GabrieleCazzulani", "AlperErturk", "MassimoRuzzene"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.124301"}

However, MD technology still faces limitations mainly due to low permeate flux and membrane wetting for feeds containing low surface tension compounds. Perfluorinated superhydrophobic membranes could be an alternative, but it has negative environmental impacts. Therefore, other low surface energy materials such as silica aerogel and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have great relevancy in ENMs fabrication.

The common advantages of I-FOGs with closed-loop compensation are linearized output characteristics and insensitivity to the light source power, including its time and thermal-induced fluctuations. Whereas closed-loop operation is normally achieved via ramp modulation requiring an electro-optic modulator, all-fiber architectures with a piezoelectric modulator are mostly limited to open loop. Nevertheless, such setups can more conveniently utilize a less expensive single-mode fiber with depolarized light and do not require any custom-made components. The proposed method allows us to combine the advantages of both approaches. Closed-loop compensation is ensured by adding further sinusoidal modulation to the common biasing modulation, such that the Sagnac phase shift is compensated solely at the sampling instants. We describe and experimentally demonstrate the proposed approach, utilizing a test setup to compare our closed-loop solution with open-loop operation. The results denote that the method provides a cost-efficient manner of performance improvement compared to the open-loop I-FOGs based on a piezoelectric modulator.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-04-13", "authors": ["MichalSkalsk\u00fd", "Zden\u011bkHavr\u00e1nek", "Ji\u0159\u00edFialka"], "doi": "10.3390/s19071710\n10.3390/s17102284\n10.1364/AOP.2.000370\n10.1016/j.yofte.2013.08.007\n10.3390/s17030567\n10.1364/AO.21.001752\n10.1109/50.144925\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.2011066\n10.1364/AO.34.005849\n10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2299212\n10.1364/OL.6.000401\n10.3390/s17040823\n10.1364/OL.9.000263\n10.1364/OL.9.000375\n10.1364/OL.13.000410\n10.1109/68.79782\n10.1070/PU2002v045n08ABEH001073\n10.1134/S0030400X08070187\n10.1007/BF01038062\n10.1007/BF02124699\n10.3390/s16050604\n10.1063/1.2560441\n10.1109/50.285318\n10.1109/50.754787\n10.1049/el:19840224\n10.3390/s150304899"}

Electrolytes are composed of polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) with PYR13TFSI on its own or with varying concentration of LiTFSI. While the extrusion of PVDF-HFP with PYR13TFSI is possible up to relatively high liquid fractions, the compatibility of PVDF-HFP with LiTFSI/PYR13TFSI solutions is much lower. An organo-modified sepiolite with D-\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS-S) can be used to enhance the compatibility of these blends and allows to prepare homogeneous PYR13TFSI/LiTFSI/PVDF-HFP electrolytes with controlled microphase separations by melt-compounding. The structure and morphology of the electrolytes has been studied by FTIR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), SEM, and AFM. Their mechanical properties have been studied by classical strain-stress experiments. Finally, ionic conductivity has been studied in the -50 to 90 \u00b0C temperature range and in diffusivity at 25 \u00b0C by PFG-NMR. These electrolytes prove to have a microphase-separated morphology and ionic conductivity which depends mainly on their composition, and a mechanical behavior typical of common thermoplastic polymers, which makes them very easy to handle. Then, in this solvent-free and scalable fashion, it is possible to prepare electrolytes like those prepared by solvent casting, but in few minutes instead of several hours or days, without solvent evaporation steps, and with ionic conductivities, which are very similar for the same compositions, above 0.1 mS\u00b7cm", "journal": "Membranes", "date": "2019-04-13", "authors": ["V\u00edctorGregorio", "NuriaGarc\u00eda", "PilarTiemblo"], "doi": "10.3390/membranes9040050\n10.1002/smll.201703001\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.035\n10.1149/1.1850854\n10.1039/C7CP03304D\n10.1149/2.1471809jes\n10.1039/C5TA06366C\n10.1149/2.0221712jes\n10.1016/j.ssi.2014.03.032\n10.1016/j.electacta.2014.06.032\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b01574\n10.3390/polym10020124\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.099\n10.3390/membranes8030055\n10.1021/ja3091438\n10.1016/j.memsci.2007.01.025\n10.3390/membranes8030045\n10.1149/1.1837555\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.151\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.015\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.080\n10.1039/C6TA02472F\n10.1016/j.matdes.2018.06.013\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.029\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.07.045\n10.1016/j.clay.2014.04.023\n10.1039/C7RA01267E\n10.1007/BF00275968\n10.1021/jp061930t\n10.1039/C8TA03134G\n10.1016/j.memsci.2017.08.073\n10.1039/B615127B"}

As it is well known that the shaping process also plays an important role in the achieved electrical properties, this study compares results for compression molded plates with random filler orientations in the plane as well as extruded films, which have, moreover, conductivity differences between extrusion direction and perpendicular to the plane. Additionally, the polymer matrix type (poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyamide 6 (PA6)) and filler concentration were varied.

Introducing a cellular structure into these materials decreases the permittivity and thus increases their sensitivity. However, foaming of piezocomposites is challenging because of the high piezoceramic loading required.

The microstructure, thermal behavior, and dielectric properties of the foams were investigated. Composite foams exhibited a fine dispersion of PZT particles in the solid phase and a uniform cellular structure with cell sizes of 50\u207b100 \u03bcm; cell size decreased with an increase in the PZT content. The total crystallinity of the composites was also decreased as the foaming degree increased.

{"title": "Preparation of PVDF/Hyperbranched-Nano-Palygorskite Composite Membrane for Efficient Removal of Heavy Metal Ions.", "abstract": "In this work, three kinds of hyperbranched polyamidoamine-palygorskite (PAMAM-Pal) were designed and synthesized by grafting the first generation polyamidoamine (G1.0 PAMAM), G2.0 PAMAM and G3.0 PAMAM onto Pal surfaces, respectively. Then, these PAMAM-Pals were used as additives to prepare polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/hyperbranched polyamidoamine-palygorskite bicomponent composite membranes. The structures of the composite membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermo gravimetric analysis (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption properties of composite membranes to heavy metal ions was studied, and the results found that the maximum adsorption capacities for Cu(II), Ni(II) and Cd(II) could reach 155.19 mg/g, 124.28 mg/g and 125.55 mg/g, respectively, for the PVDF/G3.0 PAMAM-Pal membrane, while only 23.70 mg/g, 17.74 mg/g and 14.87 mg/g could be obtained for unmodified membranes in the same conditions. The high adsorption capacity can be ascribed to the large number of amine-terminated groups, amide groups and carbonyl groups of the composite membrane.

{"title": "Measurement of Radial Elasticity and Original Height of DNA Duplex Using Tapping-Mode Atomic Force Microscopy.", "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can characterize nanomaterial elasticity. However, some one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as DNA, are too small to locate with an AFM tip because of thermal drift and the nonlinearity of piezoelectric actuators. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address the shortcomings of AFM and obtain the radial Young's modulus of a DNA duplex. The elastic properties are evaluated by combining physical calculations and measured experimental results. The initial elasticity of the DNA is first assumed; based on tapping-mode scanning images and tip\u207bsample interaction force simulations, the calculated elastic modulus is extracted. By minimizing the error between the assumed and experimental values, the extracted elasticity is assigned as the actual modulus for the material. Furthermore, tapping-mode image scanning avoids the necessity of locating the probe exactly on the target sample. In addition to elasticity measurements, the deformation caused by the tapping force from the AFM tip is compensated and the original height of the DNA is calculated. The results show that the radial compressive Young's modulus of DNA is 125\u207b150 MPa under a tapping force of 0.5\u207b1.3 nN; its original height is 1.9 nm.

The operating principle behind the SCP-LVC-MS technology is single cell isolation via small droplet piezoelectric ejection followed by capture of the droplet into an LVC-MS sampling probe. Once exposed to an appropriate solvent, the cell is lysed, extracted, and analyzed by MS. The SCP-LVC-MS approach was validated by measuring the lipid composition of microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (ChRe) and Euglena gracilis (EuGr), and HeLa cells in their native growth media. Numerous diacylglyceryltrimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS), phosphatidylcholine (PC), monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) lipids were observed in single cells. Continuous solvent flow ensures that cells are analyzed rapidly, and no signal carryover between cells is observed. ChRe and EuGr microalgae mixed together in the same solution were differentiated cell-by-cell in real-time based on differences between levels of diacylglyceryltrimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids measured in each cell. Several DGTS lipids present in ChRe were quantified with single-cell resolution by normalizing to a DGTS(32:0) internal standard added to the LVC probe solvent during analysis. Quantitative peak areas were validated by comparing to bulk lipid extracts. Lastly, peak area distributions comprised of hundreds of cells were compared for ChRe after 5 days of nitrogen-limited and normal growth conditions, which show clear differences and the ability to resolve cellular population differences with single-cell resolution.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2019-04-09", "authors": ["John FCahill", "JulianRiba", "VilmosKertesz"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00680"}

In comparison to bilayer polymer actuators, the challenge remains to manipulate single-layered soft actuators for rapid, reversible, and shape-programmed deformations in response to external stimuli owing to their homogeneous composite structures. Herein, this work reports a soft polymer film actuator that has a single-layered structure, yet demonstrates the shape-programmed motility. The actuator is composed of polyvinylidene fluoride film as a matrix and patterned by photocrosslinking of acrylamide and N', N'-methylenebisacrylamide, which generates soft-hard alternating segments in the structure. As it is exposed to acetone vapors, the soft-hard structures lead to an unequal response that results in the shape-programmed deformation. The actuator is elastic (strain: 160%) and tough (stress: 40 MPa) and can maintain its rapid, reversible, and shape-programmed motions for a few hours, even longer. The soft-hard structure enables the film actuator (3.5 mg) to give a contracting stress of 4 MPa that is used in an automatic device able to lift a cargo of 5.09 g, \u223c1453 times heavier than the film itself.

Here, we present reactive solid phase epitaxy of a layered Aurivillius-type oxyfluoride Bi2TiO4F2 from room-temperature fabricated Bi2TiOx using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a fluorine source. Bi2TiO4F2 epitaxial films are obtained by reacting a room-temperature fabricated precursor with PVDF at 330 \u00b0C under an Ar flow. However, crystallization does not proceed through PVDF treatment in air, indicating that a reduced atmosphere is crucial to removing oxide ions from the precursor and incorporating fluoride ions. The Bi2TiO4F2 film shows a peak at 240 K in the dielectric constant-versus-temperature curve, which originates from the tilting of Ti(O,F)6 octahedra. This peak temperature is lower than that of the bulk (284 K), suggesting that the local structural distortion is suppressed because of the epitaxial strain from the substrate.

Here, the former mimicked, as a minimal motif, oligodeoxyribonucleotide interactions with amino acids of proteins involved in repairing of damaged dsDNA. By electropolymerization, we molecularly imprinted non-labeled 5'-TATAAA-3' via Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing, thus synthesizing, in a one-step procedure, the hexakis[bis(2,2'-bithien-5-yl)] TTTATA and simultaneously hybridizing it with the 5'-TATAAA-3' template. That is, a stable dsDNA analog having a controlled sequence of nucleobases was formed in the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). The 5'-TATAAA-3' was by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling found to be homogeneously distributed both in the bulk of the MIP film and on its surface. The 5'-TATAAA-3' concentration in the 2.8(\u00b10.2)-nm relative surface area, ~140-nm thick MIP film was 2.1\u202fmM. The MIP served as a matrix of an artificial TATA box with the TATAAA-promoter sequence. We comprehensively characterized this artificial DNA hybrid by the polarization-modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further, we examined interactions of DNA repairing TATA binding protein (TBP) amino acids with the artificial TATA box prepared. That is, molecules of l-phenylalanine aromatic amino acid were presumably engaged in stacking interactions with nucleobase steps of this artificial TATA box.

Conventional magnetostrictive transducers for steel strand inspection are based on the magnetostrictive effect of the material itself. Two factors affect the transducing performance of the transducers on ACSR cables. On one hand, there is a non-magnetostrictive effect in aluminum wires. On the other hand, the magnetostriction of the innermost steel wires is too weak to generate guided waves. The bias magnetic field is attenuated by the outer layers of aluminum wires. In this paper, an alternative sprayed magnetostrictive powder coating (SMPC) transducer was developed for guided wave generation and detection in ACSR cables.

{"title": "A Perspective of Non-Fiber-Optical Metamaterial and Piezoelectric Material Sensing in Automated Structural Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "Metamaterials are familiar in life sciences, but are only recently adopted in structural health monitoring (SHM). Even though they have existed for some time, they are only recently classified as smart materials suitable for civil, mechanical, and aerospace (CMA) engineering. There are still not many commercialized metamaterial designs suitable for CMA sensing applications. On the other hand, piezoelectric materials are one of the popular smart materials in use for about 25 years. Both these materials are non-fiber-optical in nature and are robust to withstand the rugged CMA engineering environment, if proper designs are adopted. However, no single smart material or SHM technique can ever address the complexities of CMA structures and a combination of such sensors along with popular fiber optical sensors should be encouraged. Furthermore, the global demand for miniaturization of SHM equipment, automation and portability is also on the rise as indicated by several global marketing strategists. Recently, Technavio analysts, a well-known market research company estimated the global SHM market to grow from the current US $ 1.48 billion to US $ 3.38 billion by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.93%. The market for metamaterial is expected to grow rapidly at a CAGR of more than 22% and the market for piezoelectric materials is expected to accelerate at a CAGR of over 13%. At the same time, the global automation and robotics market in the automotive industry is expected to post a CAGR of close to 8%. The fusion of such smart materials along with automation can increase the overall market enormously. Thus, this invited review paper presents a positive perspective of these non-fiber-optic sensors, especially those made of metamaterial designs. Additionally, our recent work related to near field setup, a portable meta setup, and their functionalities along with a novel piezoelectric catchment sensor are discussed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-04-03", "authors": ["Venu Gopal MadhavAnnamdas", "Chee KiongSoh"], "doi": "10.3390/s19071490\n10.1177/1475921717750047\n10.1155/2016/4982616\n10.3390/s16010099\n10.1109/TED.2008.2006533\n10.1155/2013/834572\n10.3390/s140407394\n10.3390/s17040667\n10.1177/1475921717732331\n10.1177/1475921710365389\n10.1177/1475921716653278\n10.1088/0964-1726/26/1/015003\n10.1002/advs.201700581\n10.1117/12.2053118\n10.1364/OL.38.002104\n10.1002/adma.201706589\n10.1038/s41563-018-0252-9\n10.1117/3.626141\n10.1109/8.81453\n10.1016/j.surfrep.2004.12.002\n10.1364/OE.14.008247\n10.1088/1367-2630/8/11/264\n10.3390/s141019609\n10.1038/460579a\n10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699\n10.1088/0953-8984/10/22/007\n10.1109/22.798002\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.4184\n10.1126/science.1058847\n10.1080/00107510410001667434\n10.1126/science.1096796\n10.2528/PIER04070701\n10.1364/OE.18.025912\n10.1103/PhysRevB.99.085408\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.3966\n10.1126/science.1108759\n10.1103/PhysRevB.79.085111\n10.1103/PhysRevB.80.153103\n10.1038/nmat2009\n10.1002/1521-4095(20020116)14:2<158::AID-ADMA158>3.0.CO;2-W\n10.1038/nmat1697\n10.1126/science.1133628\n10.1038/ncomms3652\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.054301\n10.1038/nmat2141\n10.1364/OE.18.027748\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.207402\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b00692\n10.1364/OE.23.006896\n10.1002/adma.201004341\n10.1038/nmat2072\n10.1038/nature07247\n10.1038/srep35048\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2441555\n10.3390/s120302742\n10.1063/1.3250175\n10.1088/1367-2630/11/4/043015\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2038451\n10.1109/ISSNIP.2011.6146571\n10.1007/s10921-018-0490-4\n10.1063/1.3162336\n10.1088/0960-1317/18/11/115017\n10.1364/OE.18.005000\n10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2033391\n10.1117/12.924070\n10.3390/s140101691\n10.23919/URSI-AT-RASC.2018.8471313\n10.11605/j.pnrs.201701005\n10.1155/2013/637270\n10.1007/s13320-011-0051-2\n10.1002/lpor.201300144\n10.1002/lpor.201400131\n10.1103/PhysRevB.74.205436\n10.1103/PhysRevE.71.036617\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2016.07.014\n10.15302/J-ENG-2015036\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/064\n10.1002/lpor.200900050\n10.1039/c3cs60479a\n10.1016/j.dcan.2017.08.004\n10.1007/s11468-018-0841-0\n10.3390/s18061912\n10.1088/1757-899X/161/1/012060\n10.4236/eng.2011.37090\n10.1002/lpor.201500117\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.037\n10.1103/PhysRevX.4.021003\n10.12989/sss.2013.11.4.349\n10.1007/s12205-013-0390-1\n10.1038/srep14018\n10.1002/stc.418\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.21595/jve.2016.17040\n10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2000)6:4(153)\n10.1007/s11340-006-8734-0\n10.1177/1045389X13481254\n10.1063/1.4834175\n10.1177/1045389X09352816\n10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00039.x\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa5f40\n10.1007/s11837-012-0370-9\n10.1155/2010/724962\n10.1117/12.817496\n10.3390/s18124312\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2414874\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.214301\n10.1063/1.5032159\n10.1063/1.4999627\n10.1088/1361-665X/aad1b6\n10.3390/s16101577\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa851b\n10.3390/s140304755\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/3/R01\n10.1155/2013/928627"}
{"title": "A Dual-Chamber Serial\u207bParallel Piezoelectric Pump with an Integrated Sensor for Flow Rate Measurement.", "abstract": "A new concept of a dual-chamber serial-parallel piezoelectric pump with an integrated sensor (DSPPIS) is presented in this paper. By means of dividing a piezoelectric bimorph into an actuator and a sensor, sensing function is integrated onto the DSPPIS for flow rate measurement. A prototype of the DSPPIS was manufactured and assembled from a finished piezoelectric bimorph. Then, frequency and voltage characteristics were tested to evaluate the performance of the DSPPIS with serial and parallel connection. Experimental results show that the optimal frequency range of DSPPIS can be achieved and determined by itself through monitoring the sensing voltage when driven by a fixed voltage of 150 Vpp and a frequency range of 40\u207b400 Hz. For a fixed frequency of 100 Hz and a voltage range of 50\u207b250 Vpp, both the sensing voltage and output flow rate increase with the increase of driving voltage. It is observed that there is a positive correlation between sensing voltage and output flow rate, which was further fitted by using linear function. The correlation coefficients for the DSPPIS with serial and parallel connection are calculated as 0.9716 and 0.9054, respectively. As a result, the DSPPIS demonstrated in this paper has realized the measurement of flow rate without the additional flow-sensing equipment both in serial and parallel connection.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-04-03", "authors": ["SongChen", "MaiYu", "JunwuKan", "JianpingLi", "ZhonghuaZhang", "XinyiXie", "XiaominWang"], "doi": "10.3390/s19061447\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.10.010\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.08.012\n10.3390/s16122108\n10.3390/s18092881\n10.1016/j.sna.2008.01.016\n10.1007/s12541-010-0071-7\n10.3901/CJME.2015.0411.043\n10.1007/s12541-012-0101-8\n10.1177/0954406215596357\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00279-4\n10.1016/j.mee.2012.04.036\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.02.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2013.08.027\n10.1109/T-SU.1978.31006"}

{"title": "Diverse tuning underlies sparse activity in layer 2/3 vibrissal cortex of awake mice.", "abstract": "Sparse population activity is a common feature observed across cortical areas, yet the implications for sensory coding are not clear. We recorded single neuron activity in the vibrissal somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed mice using the cell-attached technique. Unlike the anaesthetised condition, in awake mice a high-velocity, piezo-controlled whisker deflection excited only a small fraction of neurons. Manual probing of whiskers revealed that the majority of these silent neurons could be activated by specific forms of whisker-object contact. Our results suggest that sparse coding in vibrissal cortex may be due to high dimensionality of the stimulus space and narrow tuning of individual neurons.\nIt is widely reported that superficial layers of the somatosensory cortex exhibit sparse firing. This sparseness could reflect weak feedforward sensory inputs that are not sufficient to generate action potentials in these layers. Alternatively, sparseness might reflect tuning to unknown or higher-level complex features that are not fully explored in the stimulus space. Here, we examined these hypotheses by applying a range of vibrotactile and manual vibrissal stimuli in awake, head-fixed mice while performing loose-seal cell-attached recordings from the vibrissal primary somatosensory (vS1) cortex. A high-velocity stimulus delivered by a piezo-electric actuator evoked activity in a small fraction of regular spiking supragranular neurons (23%) in the awake condition. However, a majority of the supragranular regular spiking neurons (84%) were driven by manual stimulation of whiskers. Our results suggest that most neurons in the superficial layers of vS1 cortex contribute to coding in the awake condition when neurons may encounter their preferred feature(s) during whisker-object interactions.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2019-04-02", "authors": ["YadollahRanjbar-Slamloo", "EhsanArabzadeh"], "doi": "10.1113/JP277506"}

To study the effect of hybridization on piezoelectric performance, pristine ZnO NRs and pristine PVDF NF nanogenerators were also fabricated. The piezoelectric performance of these three nanogenerators was evaluated under periodic deformation at low frequency. The output power of the hybrid structure was found to be enhanced compared to pristine ZnO NRs and PVDF NFs nanogenerators. Such simple hybrid devices that do not need to complicated post poling treatment are more efficient than previous hybrid PVDF/ZnO nanogenerators for practical application.

Meanwhile, the folded geometry extends the whole length of beam, and then induce a larger strain in the clamped end, leading to a more favorable output voltage. The experimental results show that the proposed structure obtains 5 resonant peaks in 0-30 Hz and an operating bandwidth of 11 Hz.

Reducing the size of the nanopositioning stage improves the response speed of the positioner but also introduces challenges in integration of conventional motion sensors. This paper presents the design and development of a novel high speed flexure-guided, piezo-electrically actuated nanopositioner with integrated optical beam deflection-based motion sensing. The sensing strategy eliminates spatial constraints even for small stages. A simple lumped-parameter model is proposed for the nanopositioner. Subsequently, the model is used to design and fabricate the nanopositioner. The measurement system is integrated with the nanopositioning stage and is employed to characterize the quasi-static and dynamic response of the stage. Finally, the in-plane motion measurements are employed to control the stage when it is commanded to track both slow- and fast-varying position signals. In both cases, the use of control is shown to significantly improve the tracking accuracy.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-04-01", "authors": ["PriyankaGupta", "PPiyush", "RSriramshankar", "G RJayanth"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5055715"}
{"title": "Effect of tip shape on nanomechanical properties measurements using AFM.", "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based indentation has been widely used to understand mechanical properties in conjunction with surface topography and structure at the nano-scale. In this work, nanomechanical properties of three different specimens were determined using four different AFM probes with spherical and flat-ended tips and conical tips with rounded apexes, to provide useful information for probe selection and for better interpretation of force-indentation data. These probes were modeled as a sphere, flat punch, and hyperboloid, respectively, after careful characterization to determine the elastic modulus based on contact models. Polyacrylic acid, polyvinylidene fluoride, and styrene-butadiene rubber were used as specimens. The results showed that the probe with a flat-ended tip was prone to misalignment between the flat end of the tip and specimen surface, which caused that the force-indentation data could not be interpreted using the contact model due to imperfect contact. Also, hysteresis was consistently observed in force-indentation data for the probes with a spherical tip and conical tips with rounded apexes, likely due to friction. This further resulted in significant differences in the elastic moduli of the specimens as large as 22-100% as determined from extension and retraction curves. The elastic moduli approximated by the mean of those from the extension and retraction curves generally agree with those from the instrumented indentation. Considering the uncertainties associated with the modeling of tip shape and force and indentation measurements, the probe with relatively large tip radius (e.g., \u223c30\u202fnm) was recommended for more accurate measurement for the specimen with a few GPa elastic modulus. Furthermore, the difference between elastic moduli determined from extension and retraction curves was found to increase as the ratio of contact stiffness to flexural stiffness of the AFM probe decreased. The outcome of this work is expected to provide useful information for obtaining accurate mechanical property measurements using an AFM based on a better understanding of the interaction between AFM probe and specimen.", "journal": "Ultramicroscopy", "date": "2019-03-31", "authors": ["Quang DangNguyen", "Koo-HyunChung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultramic.2019.03.012"}
{"title": "Biocompatible Cantilevers for Mechanical Characterization of Zebrafish Embryos using Image Analysis.", "abstract": "We have developed a force sensing system to continuously evaluate the mechanical elasticity of micrometer-scale (a few hundred micrometers to a millimeter) live tissues. The sensing is achieved by measuring the deflection of force sensitive cantilevers through microscopic image analysis, which does not require electrical strain gauges. Cantilevers made of biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were actuated by a piezoelectric actuator and functioned as a pair of chopsticks to measure the stiffness of the specimen. The dimensions of the cantilevers were easily adjusted to match the size, range, and stiffness of the zebrafish samples.

{"title": "Deposited Nanoparticles Can Promote Air Clogging of Piezoelectric Inkjet Printhead Nozzles.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric inkjet printing is susceptible to printhead clogging when printing with inks that contain dispersed particles. This paper investigates the mechanisms by which 28-530 nm nanoparticle dispersions induce printhead clogging without forming large aggregates or thick deposited layers on printhead surfaces. Printing experiments were combined with nanoparticle deposition studies and with experiments where inks were pumped through printheads at a constant flow rate with a syringe pump. Submonolayer coverages of hydrophobic cationic polystyrene nanoparticles adhering to printhead surfaces promote rapid clogging by trapped air that enters from the nozzle opening. We propose that the deposited particles distort the shape of the ink/air meniscus, possibly causing air entrainment, and promote air bubble adhesion to the interior printhead surfaces. The printer's purge-blot cleaning procedure removes air clogs, but the clogs quickly reform when printing is resumed because the adsorbed nanoparticles are not removed by the cleaning procedure. Nondepositing anionic hydrophobic nanoparticles cause much less clogging, possibly because of filtration of trace large aggregates. Colloidal stability is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for ink dispersions; the ink particles must not adsorb onto the printhead surfaces. Thus, alternate surface chemistries for the printhead and ink particle surfaces may be required to print hydrophobic ink materials.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2019-03-30", "authors": ["YuanhuaLi", "OmarDahhan", "Carlos D MFilipe", "John DBrennan", "Robert HPelton"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b04335"}

In polymeric nanofibers X-ray scattering and diffraction methods, i.e. SAXS and WAXD, are capable of decoding their structural insights from about 100 nm down to the Angstr\u00f6m scale. Here, we present a comprehensive X-ray scattering and diffraction based study and introduce new data analysis approaches to unveil detailed structural features in electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDFhfp) nanofiber membranes. Particular emphasis was placed on anisotropic morphologies being developed during the nanofiber fabrication process. Global analysis was performed on SAXS data to derive the nanofibrillar structure of repeating lamella crystalline domains with average dimensions of 12.5 nm thickness and 7.8 nm spacing along with associated tie-molecules. The varying surface roughness of the nanofiber was evaluated by extracting the Porod exponent in parallel and perpendicular direction to the nanofiber axis, which was further validated by Atomic Force Microscopy. Additionally, the presence of a mixture of the monoclinic alpha and the orthorhombic beta PVDFhfp phases both exhibiting about 6% larger unit cells compared to the corresponding pure PVDF phases was derived from WAXD.

In the future, these microdevices can provide an alternative to replace the electrochemical batteries, which cause contamination due to their toxic materials. We present the electromechanical modeling of a pVEH microdevice with a novel resonant structure for air conditioning vents at office buildings. This electromechanical modeling includes different multilayers and cross-sections of the microdevice resonator as well as the air damping. This microdevice uses a flexible substrate and it does not include toxics materials. The microdevice has a resonant structure formed by multilayer beams and U-shape proof mass of UV-resin (730 \u03bcm thickness). The multilayer beams contain flexible substrates (160 \u03bcm thickness) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), two aluminum electrodes (100 nm thickness), and a ZnO layer (2 \u03bcm thickness). An analytical model is developed to predict the first bending resonant frequency and deflections of the microdevice. This model considers the Rayleigh and Macaulay methods, and the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. In addition, the electromechanical behavior of the microdevice is determined through the finite element method (FEM) models. In these FEM models, the output power of the microdevice is obtained using different sinusoidal accelerations.

Laser lift-off (LLO) processes are used for fabrication because this is known as the most efficient technology for flexible high-performance energy harvesters. We develop two different device structures using the multistep LLO: a stacked structure and a double-faced (bimorph) structure. Although both structures are well demonstrated without serious material degradation, the stacked structure is not efficient for energy harvesting due to the ineffectively applied strain to the piezoelectric film in bending. This phenomenon stems from differences in position of mechanical neutral planes, which is investigated by finite element analysis and calculation.

{"title": "Long Slender Piezo-Resistive Silicon Microprobes for Fast Measurements of Roughness and Mechanical Properties inside Micro-Holes with Diameters below 100 \u00b5m.", "abstract": "During the past decade, piezo-resistive cantilever type silicon microprobes for high-speed roughness measurements inside high-aspect-ratio microstructures, like injection nozzles or critical gas nozzles have been developed. This article summarizes their metrological properties for fast roughness and shape measurements including noise, damping, tip form, tip wear, and probing forces and presents the first results on the measurement of mechanical surface parameters. Due to the small mass of the cantilever microprobes, roughness measurements at very high traverse speeds up to 15 mm/s are possible. At these high scanning speeds, considerable wear of the integrated silicon tips was observed in the past. In this paper, a new tip-testing artefact with rectangular grooves of different width was used to measure this wear and to measure the tip shape, which is needed for morphological filtering of the measured profiles and, thus, for accurate form measurements. To reduce tip wear, the integrated silicon tips were replaced by low-wear spherical diamond tips of a 2 \u00b5m radius.

{"title": "Real-time analysis of atrazine biodegradation and sessile bacterial growth: A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring study.", "abstract": "Biodegradation is a fundamental process for removal of the environmentally prevalent herbicide, atrazine, from contaminated waters. Biodegradation is more efficient when bacteria are attached on surface of an adsorbing carrier that supports the microbial population. However, for various reasons, biodegradation is almost always monitored in the liquid phase. In this study, we employ a novel Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation technique (QCM-D) for continuous, real-time monitoring of the attachment of atrazine-degrading bacteria to the surface, atrazine adsorption and degradation, and the consequent proliferation of the irreversibly attached sessile bacteria. The effect of atrazine biodegradation was observed in a batch mode of operation, in which a significant frequency decrease of the piezoelectric sensor was observed in the QCM-D, due to the proliferation of atrazine-degrading bacteria on the expense of atrazine. The latter was confirmed microscopically. Results also suggest that the viscoelastic properties of the atrazine-degrading consortium immediately changed in response to the presence of atrazine, whereas those of the non-degrading consortium were not affected. Importantly though, atrazine adsorption was similar regardless of the sessile consortia layers. When the QCM-D flow cell was exposed to a continuous flow of saturated atrazine solution, the degrading consortium layer was significantly more fluidic compared to batch mode conditions. The magnitude and kinetics of atrazine adsorption, which were monitored using QCM-D, were higher on bacterial cells comparing to the pristine, polystyrene-coated sensor. Findings from the current study can improve bioremediation design and open an avenue for studies on biodegradation and adsorption of micro-pollutants using QCM-D technology.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2019-03-25", "authors": ["InbarLeviRam", "AmitGross", "DavidMcCarthy", "MosheHerzberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.054"}

{"title": "Development of a PVDF Sensor Array for Measurement of the Dynamic Pressure Field of the Blade Tip in an Axial Flow Compressor.", "abstract": "Tip clearance flow in axial flow compressor is unavoidable and responsible for pressure losses and noise generation and influences the stability of the compressor. However, necessary flow measurement in the blade tip region is a great challenge due to the small gap width as well as the structure limitation. In this paper, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric-film sensor array is developed to capture the dynamic pressure field over the blade tip in an axial flow compressor. The PVDF sensor array with 40 evenly distributed sensing points is fabricated directly on a 30 \u03bcm thick aluminum-metalized polarized PVDF film through photolithography. Dynamic calibration of the sensor is accomplished using acoustic source as excitation and a microphone as a reference. The test pressure range is up to 3.5 kPa and the sampling frequency is 20 kHz. The sensor presents a high signal-to-noise ratio and good consistency with the reference microphone. Sensitivity, frequency response, linearity, hysteresis, repeatability as well as the influence of temperature are also investigated through the calibration apparatus. The calibration gives credence to the relevance and reliability of this sensor for the application in dynamic pressure field measurement. The sensor is then applied to an actual measurement in a compressor. The output of the PVDF sensor array is also compared with the results of common pressure transducers, and the features of the dynamic pressure filed are discussed. The results indicate that the PVDF sensor array is capable of the dynamic pressure field measurement over the blade tip, and superior to the conventional approaches in installation, spatial resolution, frequency response, and cost. These advantages indicate its potential broad application in pressure measurement, especially for the complex spatial surface or thin-walled structure, such as the blade surface and the thin casing wall of the compressor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-03-25", "authors": ["JiqingCong", "JianpingJing", "ChangminChen"], "doi": "10.3390/s19061404\n10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00815-0\n10.1115/1.2841344\n10.1299/kikaib.79.900\n10.1115/GT2009-59074\n10.1115/1.2812979\n10.1115/1.4038316\n10.1115/1.4004752\n10.1115/1.4004753\n10.2514/1.B36364\n10.1115/1.4023462\n10.3390/s130708669\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1230440\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1232582\n10.1080/00150193.2016.1238723\n10.1007/s00348-006-0135-8\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.933.548\n10.11858/gywlxb.2004.03.011\n10.1007/s003480050331\n10.1007/s003480050332\n10.1007/s003480050262\n10.11858/gywlxb.2000.04.010\n10.1115/1.2775487"}

The change in frequency shift mediated by AuNPs-DNA in the presence of H37Rv was detected using a multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) system. Three oligonucleotides modified with gold nanoparticles were designed. These oligonucleotides contained 12, 12, and 13 bases that hybridized with the 37-nt H37Rv aptamer. H37Rv aptamer was immobilized on the gold electrode surface by Au-S bonds. A conductive-layer was then formed by sequential hybridization of the aptamer with the three designed AuNPs-DNAs. When H37Rv was present, it specifically bound to the aptamer, resulting in the detachment of AuNPs-DNA from the electrode. The conductive layer was thereby replaced by a nonconductive complex of aptamer and bacteria. These changes were monitored by the MSPQC system.

The impedance features are extracted from the impedance signatures to analyze the sensing distance and the damage detectability of the PZT interface. Next, the splice plate of a bolted connection is selected as a practical plate-like structure for the experimental examination of the PZT interface's sensing region on a limited plate domain. The damage sensitivity behavior of the PZT interface is analyzed with respect to the damage location on the splice plate. An FE analysis of the corresponding PZT interface-splice plate system is also conducted to support the experimental results.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-03-22", "authors": ["Thanh-CanhHuynh", "So-YoungLee", "Ngoc-LoiDang", "Jeong-TaeKim"], "doi": "10.3390/s19061377\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1177/1045389X9500600117\n10.1177/104538901320560355\n10.1002/eqe.454\n10.3390/s8010327\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.525-526.569\n10.12989/smm.2014.1.3.339\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.4.1159\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/9/095015\n10.1142/S1756973715500134\n10.3390/s19010047\n10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2000)6:4(153)\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/4/317\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2009.08.021\n10.1155/2014/784731\n10.1002/stc.2173\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa931b\n10.3390/s19051054\n10.1177/1475921712451954\n10.3390/s18092766\n10.1002/stc.1684\n10.1111/str.12154"}

A widely applied way to detect wood-boring insects is to insert a piezoelectric probe with an uncoated waveguide in the tree trunk and listen for locomotion or feeding sounds through headphones. This approach has several shortcomings: (a) frequent manual inspection of trees is costly and impractical to scale to hundreds or thousands of trees, (b) the larvae could be present but inactive during the inspection time and, (c) when the trees are in urban environments the background noise can be significant and can mask the feeble sounds of wood-boring insects even with the use of specialized headphones. We introduce a remotely controlled device that records and wirelessly transmits on a scheduled basis short recordings of the internal vibrations of a tree to a server. The user can listen remotely or process the recording automatically to infer the infestation state of the tree with wood-boring insects that feed or move inside the tree. When integrated within the IoT framework this device can scale up to automatically monitoring the trees of the entire city.

A self-consistent procedure combined with hydrogenic model is implemented to estimate exciton binding energy in these CSNs, as a function of CSN dimensions, polarization charge and alloy composition. A 3-fold higher exciton binding energy in these CSNs than that in planar counterparts is attributed to an increased electron-hole overlap. The trend exhibited by the exciton binding energy with polarization charge and alloy composition in the two types of CSNs is significantly different, owing to a drastic difference in the piezoelectric polarizations. A detailed investigation of the steady-state and transient optical response from these CSNs suggests that GaN/InGaN/GaN CSNs emit a wide spectrum.

Here, the magnetic bead (MB) was used as carrier for immobilization of the aptamer of P. aeruginosa. Polyadenylated DNA was bound to the aptamer through complementary strand pairing. When the P. aeruginosa was present in the sample solution, the polyadenylated DNA was replaced by the P. aeruginosa because of the specific interaction between P. aeruginosa and its aptamer. The released polyadenylated DNA strand in the detected solution could adsorb onto the surface of Au IDE by virtue of the strong interaction between adenine (A) and Au IDE, and result in sensitive frequency shift response of the MSPQC sensor. The limits of detection (LOD) of the method were as low as 9 CFU/mL in buffer and 52 CFU/mL in simulated blood sample.

This type of pump mainly contains a chamber 12 mm in diameter and 1.1 mm in height, a PZT vibrator, and two pairs of compliant structures arranged on the flowing channel. The flow-resistance differences between these two groups of PZT pumps were theoretically and experimentally verified. The relationships between the amplitude, applied voltage and frequency of the PZT vibrators were obtained experimentally, with results illustrating that the amplitude linearly and positively correlates with the voltage, while nonlinearly and negatively correlating to the frequency. The flow rate performance of these two groups was experimentally tested from 110\u207b160 Vpp and 10\u207b130 Hz. Results showed that the flow rate positively correlates to the voltage, and the optimum flow rate frequency centers around 90 Hz for Group A and 80 Hz for Group B, respectively.

{"title": "Magnetostrictive Guided Wave Technique Verification for Detection and Monitoring Defects in the Pipe Weld.", "abstract": "During inspection of piping in nuclear power plants or other industries, it is difficult to implement conventional nondestructive techniques due to limited accessibility or obstacles such as pipes with insulation, pipes buried underground, structural complexity, or radiation environments. In addition, since the defects mainly occur in the weld region or support area, it is not easy to separate defect signals from those of structural components. To solve these problems, we developed a technique to detect and monitor the formation and growth of defects, using a magnetostrictive guided wave sensor. This sensor has advantages (such as sharp and clear signal patterns and ability to easily eliminate the signal from the geometric structure) over the conventional piezoelectric transducer. To verify our technique, signals from actual pipe welds with defects were acquired and processed with our phase matching/subtraction program.

{"title": "Advanced Micro- and Nano-Gas Sensor Technology: A Review.", "abstract": "Micro- and nano-sensors lie at the heart of critical innovation in fields ranging from medical to environmental sciences. In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in sensor design along with the advances in micro- and nano-fabrication technology and the use of newly designed materials, leading to the development of high-performance gas sensors. Advanced micro- and nano-fabrication technology enables miniaturization of these sensors into micro-sized gas sensor arrays while maintaining the sensing performance. These capabilities facilitate the development of miniaturized integrated gas sensor arrays that enhance both sensor sensitivity and selectivity towards various analytes. In the past, several micro- and nano-gas sensors have been proposed and investigated where each type of sensor exhibits various advantages and limitations in sensing resolution, operating power, response, and recovery time. This paper presents an overview of the recent progress made in a wide range of gas-sensing technology. The sensing functionalizing materials, the advanced micro-machining fabrication methods, as well as their constraints on the sensor design, are discussed. The sensors' working mechanisms and their structures and configurations are reviewed.

The low hydrothermal temperature avoids the high temperature process and keeps the flexibility of the as-synthesized materials. The formation mechanism of the resultant product is discussed in detail. The composite of MoS\u2082 not only expands the light harvesting window to include visible light, but also increases the separation efficiency of photo-generated electrons and holes. The as-prepared product has proven to possess excellent and stable photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Rhodamine B and levofloxacin hydrochloride under visible light irradiation. In addition, the TiO\u2082/PVDF@MoS\u2082 core-shell heterostructured fibers exhibit self-cleaning property to dye droplets under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, due to its hydrophobicity, the resultant product can automatically remove dust on its surface under the rolling condition of droplets. Hence, the as-prepared product cannot only degrade the contaminated compounds on the surface of the material, but also reduce the maintenance cost of the material due to its self-cleaning performance.

For this reason, the development of an automated impact monitoring system is desired. From a passive monitoring perspective, any impact generates a strain wave that can be acquired using sensor networks; signal processing techniques allow for extracting features useful for impact identification, possibly in an automatic way. However, impact wave characteristics are related to the impactor stiffness; this presents a problem for the evaluation of an impact-related feature and for the development of an automatic approach to impact identification. This work discusses the problem of reducing the influence of the impactor stiffness on one of the features typically characterizing the impact event, i.e., the time of arrival (TOA).

However, there is limited control over the morphological and directional characteristics of presynthesized nanomaterials, which makes them unsuitable for developing devices for practical applications. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating vertically aligned and polarized piezoelectric nanostructures from presynthesized biological piezoelectric nanofibers, M13 phage, with control over the orientation, polarization direction, microstructure morphology, and density using genetic engineering and template-assisted self-assembly process. The resulting vertically ordered structures exhibit strong unidirectional polarization with three times higher piezoelectric constant values than that of in-plane aligned structures, supported by second harmonic generation and piezoelectric force microscopy measurements. The resulting vertically self-assembled phage-based piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) produces up to 2.8 V of potential, 120 nA of current, and 236 nW of power upon 17 N of force. In addition, five phage-based PEH integrated devices produce an output voltage of 12 V and an output current of 300 nA, simply by pressing with a finger. The resulting device can operate light-emitting diode backlights on a liquid crystal display.

Here, we report a new approach to increase the PCEs of flexible PSCs via introducing the piezo-phototronic effect in the PSCs by growing an array of ZnO nanowires on flexible plastic substrates, which act as the electron-transport layer for PSCs. From the piezo-phototronic effect, the absolute PCE was improved from 9.3 to 12.8% for flexible perovskite solar cells under a static mechanical strain of 1.88%, with a \u223c40% enhancement but no change in the components of materials and device structure.

{"title": "Shifting colored coded aperture design for spectral imaging.", "abstract": "Compressive spectral imaging (CSI) systems sense 3D spatio-spectral data cubes with just a few two-dimensional (2D) projections by using a coded aperture, a dispersive element, and a focal plane array (FPA). The coded apertures in these systems, whose main function is the modulation of the data cube, are often implemented through photomasks attached to piezoelectric devices. A remarkable improvement on this configuration has been recently proposed, the replacement of the block-unblock coded apertures by patterned optical filter arrays, referred to as \"colored\" coded apertures, which allow spatial and spectral modulation. When using these colored coded apertures, its real implementation in terms of cost and complexity directly depends on the number of filters to be used, as well as the number of shots to be captured. A shifting colored coded aperture optimization featuring these observations is proposed, with the aim to improve the imaging quality reconstruction and to generate an achievable optical implementation with a limited number of filters requiring only one mask to acquire any number of shots. The mathematical model of the computational imaging strategy to overcome the practical limitations of actual CSI systems is presented along with a testbed implementation.

{"title": "Image-guided vibrometry system integrated with spectral- and time-domain optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "Vibrometry using optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide valuable information for investigating either the mechanical properties or the physiological function of biological tissues, especially the hearing organs. Real-time imaging of the measured tissues provides structure imaging and spatial guidance for and is thus highly demanded by such vibrometry. However, the traditional time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) systems, although capable of subnanometric vibrometry at large ranges of frequencies, are unable to offer an imaging speed that is high enough to acquire depth-resolved images for guidance. The spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) systems, although allowing image-guided vibrometry, are challenged in measuring vibration at high frequencies, particularly for scattering tissue specimens that require longer exposure time to ensure imaging and vibrometry performance. This is because of their limit in the line-scan rate of the CCD, in which the maximum resolvable frequency measured by the SD-OCT is about 1/4 of the CCD line-scan rate in practice. In the present study, we have developed a dual-mode OCT system combining both SD-OCT and TD-OCT modalities for image-guided vibrometry, as the SD-OCT can provide guiding structural images in real-time and, moreover, the TD-OCT can guarantee vibrometry at large ranges of frequencies, including high frequencies. The efficacy of the developed system in image-guided vibrometry has been experimentally demonstrated using both piezoelectric ceramic transducer (PZT) and ex vivo middle-ear samples from guinea pigs. For the vibrometry of PZT, the minimum detectable vibration amplitude was reached at \u223c0.01\u2009\u2009nm. For the vibrometry of the sound-evoked biological samples, both real-time two-dimensional imaging and subnanometric vibrometry were performed at the frequency ranging from 1 to 40\u00a0kHz. These results indicate that our dual-mode OCT system is able to act as an excellent vibrometer enabling image-guided high-frequency measurement.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2019-03-16", "authors": ["CuixiaGuo", "XiaojieYang", "Jian-PingWu", "XiaoruiGuo", "YonghongHe", "ZhiyuanShen", "ZhanSun", "TianGuan", "FangyiChen"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.58.001606"}
{"title": "Single-shot wavelength-independent phase-shifting method for full-field optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "One limitation of a piezoelectric translator-based phase-shifting method in full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) is that there exist interference residuals because a light source with broadband is used. In this work, an achromatic phase-shifting method was proposed in which a linear polarizer and a quarter-wave plate were employed to generate the circularly polarized light in the reference arm of a basic Linnik interferometer. The light field reflected from the reference arm is supposed with the unpolarized light backscattered from the sample when the path difference is within the coherence length of the light source. A first phase difference of \u03c0/2 can be generated on the propagation of superposed light beams through the polarized beam splitter. An additional phase difference of \u03c0/2 can be obtained by the proposed numerical method, thus producing the similar effects as the four-frame phase-shifting way. An en face tomographic image can be obtained with a single-shot in this new FF-OCT system. The axial and lateral resolutions of the system are around 1.4\u00a0\u03bcm and 0.8\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively.

The time dependence of the intensity of the sideband spectrum is explained by Newton's second law assuming that the oscillator has a mechanical resonance frequency and undergoes simple vibration under the driving force, which depends on the deformation velocity of the piezoelectric element.

In addition, the nanostructures (hollow spheres, solid spheres, yolk-shells, aggregations and defect-rich nanoparticles) of HfO2 assemblies can be well manipulated by simply modulating the synthesis parameters. The marked difference in the chemical bonds by the different ligands resulted in discrepant hydrolysis and then specific directional bonds for the diversity of the resultant HfO2 assemblies.

{"title": "Bond-Slip Monitoring of Concrete Structures Using Smart Sensors-A Review.", "abstract": "Concrete structures with various reinforcements, such as steel bars, composite material tendons, and recently steel plates, are commonly used in civil infrastructures. When an external force overcomes the strength of the bond between the reinforcement and the concrete, bond-slip will occur, resulting in a relative displacement between the reinforcing materials and the concrete. Monitoring bond health plays an important role in guaranteeing structural safety. Recently, researchers have recognized the importance of bond-slip monitoring and performed many related investigations. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review on various smart sensors based on piezoelectric effect and fiber optic technology, as well as corresponding techniques for bond-slip monitoring is presented. Since piezoelectric sensors and fiber-optic sensors are widely used in bond-slip monitoring, their principles and relevant monitoring methods are also introduced in this paper. Particularly, the piezoelectric-based bond-slip monitoring methods including the active sensing method, the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) method and the passive sensing using acoustic emission (AE) method, and the fiber-optic-based bond-slip detecting approaches including the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and the distributed fiber optic sensing are highlighted. This paper provides guidance for practical applications and future development of bond-slip monitoring.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-03-14", "authors": ["LinshengHuo", "HaoCheng", "QingzhaoKong", "XueminChen"], "doi": "10.3390/s19051231\n10.1016/C2013-0-00155-7\n10.3390/ma3125169\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/12/125015\n10.1088/1361-665X/aabaaf\n10.1002/stc.1669\n10.1680/macr.9.00209\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.10.080\n10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000642\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.103\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.04.068\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2006.10.006\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.208\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1991)117:3(699)\n10.1617/s11527-014-0261-3\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2005.05.001\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.03.031\n10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(1997)1:2(40)\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2005.01.014\n10.1088/0964-1726/9/4/317\n10.3390/s17040776\n10.2514/3.10984\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/4/045005\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/12/125011\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1428041\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.10.043\n10.1109/JIOT.2018.2817601\n10.1177/1045389X12461080\n10.1063/1.4997274\n10.1115/1.1547682\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/007\n10.1088/1361-665X/aaf585\n10.3233/JAE-160049\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035013\n10.1023/A:1009926623551\n10.1016/S0094-5765(97)00185-9\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/1/004\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6768\n10.3390/s18061782\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6a8e\n10.1177/1045389X07077400\n10.3390/s17020250\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/1/015031\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.10.044\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/11/115031\n10.3390/s17102395\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/2/025010\n10.3390/s17092001\n10.3390/s17081812\n10.1177/1045389X14536010\n10.1016/j.jsv.2009.02.028\n10.3390/s18061727\n10.3390/s18051563\n10.3390/s18051377\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2302893\n10.1155/2013/871213\n10.3390/s8010271\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9a65\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9dd0\n10.1177/1475921707081979\n10.3390/app6110320\n10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000632\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa6e93\n10.3390/s101211644\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2855693\n10.3390/app6100298\n10.3390/s18124137\n10.1177/1045389X08100384\n10.3390/s18051591\n10.1504/IJMPT.2011.040292\n10.3390/s18103503\n10.3390/en9010040\n10.3390/s17030657\n10.3390/app8101775\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/038\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/026\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/4/047001\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/003\n10.1155/2016/3270916\n10.1177/1475921715596219\n10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000066\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/6/065012\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/12/125030\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115020\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80bc\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80ef\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.569-570.805\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/10/105035\n10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00368-4\n10.1109/JLT.2011.2106479\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.05.018\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/3/035015\n10.1002/stc.1745\n10.1016/j.yofte.2013.11.004\n10.1109/JLT.2016.2615468\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/320\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/5/046\n10.1139/t04-059\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2006.10.021\n10.1007/BF02480424\n10.1061/9780872628953.ch08\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/4/045017\n10.1364/OL.14.000823\n10.1109/49.57798\n10.1016/S1068-5200(02)00527-8\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2007.05.003\n10.3390/s16050748\n10.3390/s120708601\n10.1177/1475921712455683\n10.1002/stc.1771\n10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3828(2008)22:4(264)\n10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000637\n10.1364/AO.41.005105\n10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00446.x\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/11/115039\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095003\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/12/125026\n10.3390/s18082653\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2660301\n10.3390/app8030320\n10.1177/2280800017753051\n10.1680/macr.1996.48.177.311\n10.1177/1369433216678864\n10.1002/stc.1893\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/7/075034\n10.1177/1475921716681460\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.07.093\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000845\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.02.020\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.06.046\n10.3390/s19010159\n10.1016/j.net.2019.01.013\n10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0001372\n10.1080/01694243.2016.1261505\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.07.042\n10.1117/12.843559\n10.1117/12.787120\n10.1109/JIOT.2018.2852653\n10.3390/s140304755\n10.3390/app8112304\n10.3390/s18082489\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000904\n10.3390/s17122796\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.1.135\n10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2550\n10.1088/1361-665X/aac962\n10.1109/TIE.2016.2620102\n10.1109/JPROC.2008.921607\n10.1109/TIE.2013.2242416"}

{"title": "Mini-Generator Based on Reciprocating Vertical Motions Driven by Intracorporeal Energy.", "abstract": "Most implantable devices rely on a power supply from batteries and require replacement surgeries once the batteries run low. Mini-generators that harvest intracorporeal energy available in the human body are promising replacements of batteries and prolong the lifetime of implantable devices, thus reducing surgery pain, risks, and cost. Although various sources of energy available in the human body are used for electricity generation using piezoelectric and triboelectric materials or intravascular turbines, concerns about material durability or thrombus risks remain, and developing novel strategies to fabricate a mini-generator to harvest the intracorporeal energy is still challenging. Herein, a mini-generator system is designed by exporting the systolic/diastolic blood pressure from the femoral artery of a sheep to trigger the pressure-responsive reciprocating vertical motions of a conductor. By applying a magnetic field, an induced voltage of 0.32 V and a stable output power of 13.86 \u00b5W are obtained, which is promising to power a state-of-the-art pacemaker (8-10 \u00b5W).

This study tested whether a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) would enhance sleep and attenuate neuropathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits in an AD-relevant mouse model, 5XFAD.\nWild-type (C57Bl6/SJL) and 5XFAD mice received chronic treatment with vehicle or DORA-22. Piezoelectric recordings monitored sleep and spatial memory was assessed via spontaneous Y-maze alternations. A\u03b2 plaques, A\u03b2 levels, and neuroinflammatory markers were measured by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively.\nIn 5XFAD mice, DORA-22 significantly increased light-phase sleep without reducing A\u03b2 levels, plaque density, or neuroinflammation. Effects of DORA-22 on cognitive deficits could not be determined because the 5XFAD mice did not exhibit deficits.\nThese findings suggest that DORAs may improve sleep in AD patients.

{"title": "A Polymer-based Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester with a 3D Meshed-Core Structure.", "abstract": "In this study, we fabricated a flexible 3D mesh structure with periodic voids by using a 3D lithography method and applying it to a vibration energy harvester to lower resonance frequency and increase output power. The fabrication process is mainly divided into two parts: three-dimensional photolithography for processing a 3D mesh structure, and a bonding process of piezoelectric films and the mesh structure. With the fabricated flexible mesh structure, we achieved the reduction of resonance frequency and improvement of output power, simultaneously. From the results of the vibration tests, the meshed-core-type vibration energy harvester (VEH) exhibited 42.6% higher output voltage than the solid-core-type VEH. In addition, the meshed-core-type VEH yielded 18.7 Hz of resonance frequency, 15.8% lower than the solid-core-type VEH, and 24.6 \u03bcW of output power, 68.5% higher than the solid-core-type VEH. The advantage of the proposed method is that a complex and flexible structure with voids in three dimensions can be relatively easily fabricated in a short time by the inclined exposure method. As it is possible to lower the resonance frequency of the VEH by the mesh structure, use in low-frequency applications, such as wearable devices and house appliances, can be expected in the future.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2019-03-12", "authors": ["TakuyaTsukamoto", "YoheiUmino", "KotaroHashikura", "SachieShiomi", "KouYamada", "TakaakiSuzuki"], "doi": "10.3791/59067"}
{"title": "Fast positioning for X-ray scanning microscopy by a combined motion of sample and beam-defining optics.", "abstract": "Scanning X-ray microscopy such as X-ray ptychography requires accurate and fast positioning of samples in the X-ray beam. Sample stages often have a high mobile mass as they may carry additional mechanics or mirrors for position measurements. The high mobile mass of a piezo stage can introduce vibrations in the setup that will lead to imaging quality deterioration. Sample stages also require a large travel range which results in a slow positioning step response and thus high positioning overhead. Moving lightweight X-ray optics, such as focusing Fresnel zone plates, instead of the sample can improve the situation but it may lead to undesired variations in the illumination probe which may result in reconstruction artifacts. This paper presents a combined approach in which a slow sample stage mechanism covers the long distance range for a large field of view, and a light-weight optics scanner with a small travel range creates a superimposed motion to achieve a fast step response. The step response in the ptychographic tomography instrument used was thereby improved by an order of magnitude, allowing for efficient measurement without loss of imaging quality.", "journal": "Journal of synchrotron radiation", "date": "2019-03-12", "authors": ["MichalOdstrcil", "MaximeLebugle", "ThierryLachat", "J\u00f6rgRaabe", "MirkoHoller"], "doi": "10.1107/S160057751801785X"}

{"title": "Comparison of osteogenic differentiation potential of induced pluripotent stem cells on 2D and 3D polyvinylidene fluoride scaffolds.", "abstract": "In recent decades, tissue engineering has been the most contributor for introducing 2D and 3D biocompatible osteoinductive scaffolds as bone implants. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), due to the unique mechanical strength and piezoelectric properties, can be a good choice for making a bone bioimplant. In the present study, PVDF nanofibers and film were fabricated as 3D and 2D scaffolds, and then, osteogenic differentiation potential of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was investigated when grown on the scaffolds by evaluating the common osteogenic markers in comparison with tissue culture plate. Biocompatibility of the fabricated scaffolds was confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and scanning electron microscopy assays. Human iPSCs cultured on PVDF nanofibers showed a significantly higher alkaline phosphate activity and calcium content compared with the iPSCs cultured on PVDF film. Osteogenic-related genes and proteins were also expressed in the iPSCs seeded on PVDF nanofibers significantly higher than iPSCs seeded on PVDF film, when investigated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. According to the results, the PVDF nanofibrous scaffold showed a greater osteoinductive property compared with the PVDF film and due to the material similarity of the scaffolds, it could be concluded that the 3D structure could lead to better bone differentiation. Taken together, the obtained results demonstrated that human iPSC-seeded PVDF nanofibrous scaffold could be considered as a promising candidate for use in bone tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2019-03-10", "authors": ["AliMirzaei", "Abbas ShapouriMoghadam", "Mohamad FoadAbazari", "FatemehNejati", "SepehrTorabinejad", "MohamadKaabi", "Seyed EhsanEnderami", "AbdolrezaArdeshirylajimi", "MaryamDarvish", "FatemehSoleimanifar", "EhsanSaburi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.28415"}
{"title": "Development of a battery-free ultrasonically powered functional electrical stimulator for movement restoration after paralyzing spinal cord injury.", "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is used to restore movements in paretic limbs after severe paralyses resulting from neurological injuries such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Most chronic FES systems utilize an implantable electrical stimulator to deliver a small electric current to the targeted muscle or nerve to stimulate muscle contractions. These implanted stimulators are generally bulky, mainly due to the size of the batteries. Furthermore, these battery-powered stimulators are required to be explanted every few years for battery replacement which may result in surgical failures or infections. Hence, a wireless power transfer technique is desirable to power these implantable stimulators.\nConventional wireless power transduction faces significant challenges for safe and efficient energy transfer through the skin and deep into the body. Inductive and electromagnetic power transduction is generally used for very short distances and may also interfere with other medical measurements such as X-ray and MRI. To address these issues, we have developed a wireless, ultrasonically powered, implantable piezoelectric stimulator. The stimulator is encapsulated with biocompatible materials.\nThe stimulator is capable of harvesting a maximum of 5.95\u2009mW electric power at an 8-mm depth under the skin from an ultrasound beam with about 380\u2009mW/cm\nA battery-free miniature (10\u2009mm diameter \u00d7\u20094\u2009mm thickness) implantable stimulator, developed in the current study is capable of directly stimulating paretic muscles through external ultrasound signals.

The performance of the CF electrode was evaluated on the basis of piezo-resistive responses from the sensors subjected to dynamic sinusoidal compressive strains at different levels and frequencies. The responses were positive-pressure effects with rate-dependent asymmetric nonlinear hysteresis characteristics. Developing a mathematical model to describe the rate-dependent asymmetric nonlinear hysteresis behavior is technically impossible; therefore, we employed artificial intelligence-based hysteresis modeling, long short-term memory recurrent neural network, to describe the hysteresis nonlinearity. The debonding strength of the CF electrode was determined in the pull-off testing and was found to be much higher than that of a copper wire electrode. The debonding mechanism was further elucidated via an in situ resistance profile. The importance of a robust conductive interface between a CF electrode and a nanocomposite was experimentally demonstrated. It was found that the inherent piezo-resistance of the CF was negligible compared with the piezo-resistance of the sensor; therefore, the signals from the sensor were free of interference. We believe CF-embedded tunable piezo-resistive sensors could be used in biomedical devices, artificial e-skins, robotic touch applications, and flexible keyboards where the required stretchability of the electrode can be introduced via an appropriate geometrical design.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-03-08", "authors": ["Min-YoungCho", "Jeong HeonLee", "Seong-HoonKim", "Ji SikKim", "SumanTimilsina"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.9b00464"}

Additionally, the TC(002)-dependent photovoltaic and rectification properties are observed.

Therefore, in male and female streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg)-induced T1DM and healthy control (CTL) rats, we examined the pressor and cardioaccelerator responses to tendon stretch during the early stage of the disease. To determine the role of Piezo channels, GsMTx-4, a selective Piezo channel inhibitor, was injected into the arterial supply of the hindlimb.

{"title": "Hydrogen-bonded organo-amino phosphonium halides: dielectric, piezoelectric and possible ferroelectric properties.", "abstract": "Molecular ferroelectric materials are an exciting class of materials for potential applications in energy and electronics. Herein, we report examples of hydrogen-bonded binary salts of diphenyl diisopropylamino phosphonium halides [Ph2(iPrNH)2P]\u00b7X [DPDP\u00b7X, X = Cl, Br, I] which show dielectric, piezoelectric and NLO properties and some potentially ferroelectric attributes at room temperature. The phosphonium bromide salt was prepared by bromination of the phosphine precursor Ph2PCl and its subsequent treatment with isopropyl amine. The chloride and iodide salts were synthesized by the halogen exchange reaction of the bromide salt. The variable temperature single crystal X-ray analysis indicates the retention of the polar non-centrosymmetric phase of these materials for a wide range of temperatures from 100 to 400 K and above. All these assemblies were shown to exhibit 1D H-bonded chain structures along the crystallographic b-axis. The P-E loop measurements of these salts gave curves similar to those of non-linear leaky dielectric materials. However, the vertical piezoresponse force microscopy (V-PFM) analyses showed the existence of polarizable domain inversions indicating the possibility of ferroelectric behaviour in these materials. The temperature dependent dielectric measurements on these salts support the absence of phase transition temperatures in these assemblies. Also, bias-dependent PFM studies reveal their piezoelectric nature as the obtained converse piezoelectric coefficients are consistent with the d33 values obtained by the direct quasi-static methods.", "journal": "Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)", "date": "2019-03-07", "authors": ["ThangavelVijayakanth", "RichaPandey", "PriyangiKulkarni", "BaluPraveenkumar", "DineshKabra", "RamamoorthyBoomishankar"], "doi": "10.1039/c8dt04498h"}

The forces are primarily transferred to the inner ear. They are transferred partly to the stapedial annular ligament which exhibits non-linear behavior and stiffens for larger static forces. In unventilated middle ears, static pressure is additionally transferred to the ossicles. The purpose of this study was to measure the force inside the ossicular chain as a physiological parameter. We determined the forces which act for dynamic sound transmission and for static load on the ossicular chain. The study is the first one which introduces these forces. The static forces have direct impact on clinically relevant questions for middle ear reconstructions with passive or active prosthesis. The dynamic forces have an impact on the development of middle ear sensors. Quasi-static forces in the incudostapedial joint (ISJ) gap were measured with two different sensor types in 17 temporal bones. The sensing elements, a single crystal piezo and a strain gauge element for validation, were bonded to a thin flexible titanium plate and encapsulated in a titanium housing to allow the acquisition of the applied force signal inside the ossicular chain. Dynamic forces were measured in 11 temporal bones with the piezo sensor. We measured a static force of 23\u202fmN in the ISJ after sensor insertion.

{"title": "Lamb Wave-Minimum Sampling Variance Particle Filter-Based Fatigue Crack Prognosis.", "abstract": "Fatigue cracks are one of the common failure types of key aircraft components, and they are the focus of prognostics and health management (PHM) systems. Monitoring and prediction of fatigue cracks show great application potential and economic benefit in shortening aircraft downtime, prolonging service life, and enhancing maintenance. However, the fatigue crack growth process is a non-linear non-Gaussian dynamic stochastic process, which involves a variety of uncertainties. Actual crack initiation and growth sometimes deviate from the results of fracture mechanics analysis. The Lamb wave-particle filter (LW-PF) fatigue-crack-life prediction based on piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensors has the advantages of simple modeling and on-line prediction, making it suitable for engineering applications. Although the resampling algorithm of the standard particle filter (PF) can solve the degradation problem, the discretization error still exists. To alleviate the accuracy decrease caused by the discretization error, a Lamb wave-minimum sampling variance particle filter (LW-MSVPF)-based fatigue crack life prediction method is proposed and validated by fatigue test of the attachment lug in this paper. Sampling variance (SV) is used as a quantitative index to analyze the difference of particle distribution before and after resampling. Compared with the LW-PF method, LW-MSVPF can increase the prediction accuracy with the same computational cost. By using the minimum sampling variance (MSV) resampling method, the original particle distribution is retained to a maximum degree, and the discretization error is significantly reduced. Furthermore, LW-MSVPF maintains the characteristic of dimensional freedom, which means a broader application in on-line prognosis for more complex structures.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-03-06", "authors": ["WeiboYang", "PeiweiGao"], "doi": "10.3390/s19051070\n10.1016/0142-1123(84)90005-7\n10.1111/ffe.12090\n10.1177/1045389X12457835\n10.1016/j.ijplas.2008.11.003\n10.1155/2018/6025825\n10.3390/s17040696\n10.1049/ip-f-2.1993.0015\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa7168\n10.3390/s16030320\n10.5391/IJFIS.2007.7.4.221\n10.1177/0142331208092026\n10.1016/j.probengmech.2008.10.002\n10.1016/j.ress.2010.08.009\n10.1016/j.ress.2005.01.002\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2013.11.008\n10.1109/TR.2014.2366759\n10.1016/j.ress.2014.09.014\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.07.016\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.11.008\n10.1109/MSP.2014.2330626\n10.1631/FITEE.1500199\n10.1023/A:1008935410038\n10.1115/1.3656900\n10.2514/1.C031808\n10.1016/j.matdes.2010.09.036\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.08.022\n10.12989/sss.2006.2.2.101\n10.3390/s140201902\n10.3390/s16091511\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/055048\n10.1111/j.2517-6161.1954.tb00145.x\n10.1155/S1110865704405149\n10.1109/7.570818\n10.1287/moor.8.4.538\n10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2013.03.016"}
{"title": "Using the Footfall Sound of Dairy Cows for Detecting Claw Lesions.", "abstract": "An important factor for animal welfare in cattle farming is the detection of lameness. The presented study is part of a project aiming to develop a system that is capable of an automated diagnosis of claw lesions by analyzing the footfall sound. Data were generated from cows walking along a measurement zone where piezoelectric sensors recorded their footfall sounds. Locomotion of the animals was scored and they were graded according to a three-scale scoring system (LS1 = non-lame; LS2 = uneven gait; LS3 = lame). Subsequently, the cows were examined by a hoof trimmer. The walking speed across the test track was significantly higher in cows with LS1 compared to those with LS2 and LS3 and thus, they were showing a smoother gait pattern. The standard deviation of volume (SDV) in the recorded footfall sound signal was considered as a factor for the force of a cow's footsteps.

Aiming at the acceleration-induced effects of pressure sensors, a dynamic compensation method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with system identification theory (SIT) is proposed in this paper. This method is more effective at reducing the error of the acceleration-induced effects without affecting the sensor's sensitivity and inherent frequency. The principle and theoretical basis of acceleration-induced effects is analyzed, and the static and dynamic acceleration-induced effects on the quartz crystal of a piezoelectric pressure sensor are performed. An acceleration-induced effects dynamic calibration system is built using a Machete hammer, which generates acceleration signals with larger amplitude and narrower pulse width, and an autoregressive exogenous (ARX)mathematical model of acceleration-induced effects is obtained using empirical mode decomposition-system identification theory (EMD-SIT). A digital compensation filter for acceleration-induced effects is designed on the basis of this model. Experimental results explain that the acceleration-induced effects of the pressure sensor were less than 11% after using the digital compensation filter.

{"title": "A method to correct hysteresis of scanning probe microscope images based on a sinusoidal model.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in scanning platforms of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). However, the hysteresis of piezoelectric actuators reduces positioning accuracy and results in distorted SPM images. When regular raster scanning of SPM starts, the piezoelectric actuators move repeatedly at the same scanning range and frequency once the scanning parameters are set. In this study, a practical and simple mathematical model derived from experimental phenomenon, which is the combination of sinusoidal and linear functions, was proposed to describe the hysteresis behavior of piezoelectric actuators with repeated scanning. The model parameter was calculated from the coordinates of matched feature points in the trace and retrace images of ordinary sample obtained with an atomic force microscope (AFM). Experimental results show that the hysteresis of the scanned images is decreased from 107.46 pixels to 2.50 pixels after correction, with a width of 800 pixels. Hysteresis in other scanned images with different scanning frequencies and ranges was also corrected effectively using this model. The proposed model can be used to correct the hysteresis of AFM images without using any expensive displacement sensors or standard samples. The model is suitable and easy to be integrated into the scanning program of AFM without requiring hardware modifications.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2019-03-06", "authors": ["LianshengZhang", "XiaoboChen", "JichaoHuang", "HongliLi", "LijuanChen", "QiangxianHuang"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5052281"}

However, knife-edge scanning provides only one-dimensional information and this method suffers from being time-consuming and requiring a high-resolution piezo translation stage.

These devices and tips were compared among each other with regard to conventional rotatory and oscillating systems with special focus on the insert tip design and thickness.\nThe osteotomies were conducted on porcine ribs utilizing 12 different insert tips (straight and angulated) and three conventional systems. After time and temperature measurements, histological analysis was carried out. Light microscopy was used to evaluate the roughness of the osteotomic surface and to search for indications of thermal bone necrosis. A special software analyzing tool was employed to determine cutting width (mm) and debris (%).\nAll piezoelectric tips created smooth cuts. Cutting widths in general were wider than the actual insert tip size with a tendency for narrow straight insert tips producing relatively wide osteotomies, whereas narrow angulated inserts produced relatively small osteotomies. None of the samples demonstrated distinct indication of necrosis. Overall, there was only a small amount of debris in all osteotomy gaps. Conventional rotatory saws were faster and created less heat compared to all tested piezoelectric systems. Straight tips proved faster osteotomy speed than angulated tips. Thin insert tips indicated to have a positive correlation to osteotomy time and performed faster than conventional microsaw. The average temperature rise was lower when using conventional systems, but critical exceeding temperatures were only observed in short-time exceptional cases. In general, temperature rise was less when using angulated inserts.\nAll tested tips are appropriate for bone surgery. Only small differences were found among the piezoelectric insert tips. Although conventional rotatory systems in general performed faster osteotomies, special designed and thin piezoelectric insert tips seem to have a positive influence on osteotomy speed. Ultimately, none of the tested devices or inserts combined all best features of speed, heat development, bone structure influence, and safety.\nNarrow and straight piezoelectric insert tips demonstrated reduced osteotomy times.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a repositioning procedure of such ankylosed permanent front teeth by a distraction osteogenesis procedure. Five patients (mean age 13.4 years), with an ankylosed permanent front tooth in the anterior area, were enrolled in the present study. After the pre-operatory orthodontic preparation, each selected site was treated with single-tooth dento-alveolar block osteotomy surgery performed with a piezoelectric surgery device with ultrasonic cuts on the buccal side. Subsequently, a custom distraction device, made by a resin splint and a sector expansion screw, was set in such a way it delivered a force with direction and sense towards the planned position of the tooth as well as the osteotomy's incision.

{"title": "Genetic analysis of a Piezo-like protein suppressing systemic movement of plant viruses in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "abstract": "As obligate intracellular phytopathogens, plant viruses must take advantage of hosts plasmodesmata and phloem vasculature for their local and long-distance transports to establish systemic infection in plants. In contrast to well-studied virus local transports, molecular mechanisms and related host genes governing virus systemic trafficking are far from being understood. Here, we performed a forward genetic screening to identify Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with enhanced susceptibility to a 2b-deleted mutant of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV-2aT\u22062b). We found that an uncharacterized Piezo protein (AtPiezo), an ortholog of animal Piezo proteins with mechanosensitive (MS) cation channel activities, was required for inhibiting systemic infection of CMV-2aT\u22062b and turnip mosaic virus tagged a green fluorescent protein (GFP) (TuMV-GFP).

Tailoring the surface properties of the membrane is critical in order to reduce the rate of adsorption of dissolved organic species as well as mineral salts. The PVDF membranes have been modified by grafting zwitterion and polyionic liquid-based polymer chains. In addition, surface oxidation of the PVDF membrane has been conducted using KMnO\u2084 and NaOH. Surface modification conditions were chosen in order to minimize the decrease in contact angle. Thus, the membranes remain hydrophobic, essential for suppression of wetting. DCMD was conducted using the base PVDF membrane as well as modified membranes. In addition, DCMD was conducted on the base membrane using produced water (PW) that was pretreated by electrocoagulation to remove dissolved organic compounds. After DCMD all membranes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy imaging as well as Energy-Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy.

TiMESH, DynaMesh and Surgipro showed similar adhesion rates at 7/14 days and optimal tissue integration, with significant differences in comparison to Preclude. The greatest presence of macrophages was observed for TiMESH and was significant versus that for Preclude. Hybrid meshes revealed significantly higher collagen 1 mRNA expression in implants, with no differences in the levels of collagen 3. Omental samples from animals with a reticular mesh showed significantly greater collagen 1 mRNA levels.\nThe reticular structure of a mesh limits the formation of a continuous mesothelial monolayer in vitro, regardless of its composition. The presence of titanium as a coating or polyvinylidene fluoride interwoven with polypropylene in a reticular structure did not prevent adhesions. The hybrid meshes showed proper integration and an increase in the mRNA Col 1 levels in the implant area compared to Surgipro or Preclude.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2019-02-28", "authors": ["Ver\u00f3nicaG\u00f3mez-Gil", "MartaRodr\u00edguez", "FranciscaGarc\u00eda-Moreno Nisa", "B\u00e1rbaraP\u00e9rez-K\u00f6hler", "GemmaPascual"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0213005\n10.1016/S0039-6109(03)00132-4\n10.1002/14651858.CD007781.pub2\n10.1007/s10029-004-0271-0\n10.1007/s10029-010-0734-4\n10.1007/s00464-011-1823-x\n10.1002/jbm.820280312\n10.1007/s00464-008-9923-y\n10.1159/000079917\n10.1007/s00464-004-8277-3\n10.1002/bjs.7082\n10.5114/aoms.2013.35345\n10.1007/s10029-013-1187-3\n10.1308/rcsann.2016.0292\n10.1007/s10029-016-1541-3\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2008.00441.x\n10.1371/journal.pbio.1000412\n10.1007/s10029-005-0012-z\n10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.01364.x\n10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.0870101436.x\n10.1007/s10029-008-0435-4\n10.1007/s00464-005-0706-4\n10.1080/00015458.2016.1179513\n10.1002/jbm.b.31106\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.05.002\n10.1002/bjs.6446\n10.1007/s00464-008-9876-1\n10.1007/s10029-010-0659-y\n10.1016/j.surg.2009.10.011\n10.1067/j.cpsurg.2015.05.001\n10.1007/s00464-012-2425-y\n10.1002/bjs.5208\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000002326\n10.1016/j.surg.2008.04.005\n10.1007/s00423-006-0138-1"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether exposure to female estrous is beneficial to recovery following transient ischemic stroke in male mice.\nCerebral ischemia was induced in male ICR mice with thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 30\u00a0min followed by reperfusion. MCAO mice were randomly divided into MCAO group and Estrous Female Exposure (EFE) group. The mice in the EFE group were subjected to estrous female mouse interaction from day 1 until the end of the experiment. Mortality was recorded during the investigation. Behavioral functions were assessed by a beam-walking test and corner test from day 1 to day 10 after MCAO. Serum testosterone levels were analyzed with ELISA, and the expression levels of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and synaptophysin in the cortex of the ischemic hemisphere were determined by western blot on day 7 after MCAO.\nExposure to female estrous reduced the mortality induced by cerebral ischemic lesions. The beam-walking test demonstrated that exposure to female estrous significantly improved motor function recovery. The serum testosterone levels and ischemic cortex GAP-43 expression were significantly higher in MCAO male mice exposed to female estrous.\nExposure to female estrous reduces mortality and improves functional recovery in MCAO male mice.

This report summarizes recent significant progress in the development of hybrid nanogenerators for a sustainable energy harvesting system that use natural and artificial energies such as solar, wind, wave, heat, machine vibration, and automobile noise. It starts with a brief introduction of energy harvesting systems, and then summarizes the different hybrid energy harvesting systems: integration of mechanical and photovoltaic energy harvesters, integration of mechanical and thermal energy harvesters, integration of thermal and photovoltaic energy harvesters, and others. In terms of the reported hybrid nanogenerators, a systematic summary of their structures, working mechanisms, and output performances is provided. Specifically, electromagnetic induction, triboelectric, piezoelectric, photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and pyroelectric effects are reviewed on the basis of the individual and hybrid power performances of hybrid nanogenerators and their practical applications with various device designs.

However, previous works\u00a0using the serpentine layout mainly focused on the optimization of structural stretchability. In this paper, the serpentine mesh design concept is used to transform the high-performance but hard-to-stretch piezoelectric film into a stretchable form. The serpentine layout design strategies for the piezoelectric film, which aim at not only desired stretchability but also high utilization of the strain in the piezoelectric film during deformation, are discussed with experimental and computational results. A stretchable micromotion sensor with high sensitivity is realized using the piezoelectric film with a serpentine layout. Human voice recognition applications of the sensor, including speech pattern recognition with machine learning, are demonstrated with the sensor integrated with a wireless module.

We have devised a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite film filled with small graphene oxide (GO) sheets that have aromatic molecules attached to their surfaces. The use of 4,4'-oxydiphenol molecules to functionalize graphene sheets is found to have a remarkable effect on enhancing the dielectric permittivity as well as reducing the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite. When under an electric field, these molecules with an angled molecular geometry act as aligned electric dipoles to largely enhance the dielectric permittivity of the composite, reaching a level two orders of magnitude higher than that of the counterpart filled with blank graphene sheets. Also, the aromatic molecules on the graphene surface act as resistive barriers that block charge transfer between interconnected graphene sheets. As a consequence, the electric conductivity of the composite can be decreased by two orders of magnitude. The PVDF composite filled with functionalized graphene shows a percolation threshold of 13 wt% and a high dielectric constant of 1091 at 100 Hz at this point.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2019-02-26", "authors": ["MingLi", "JinzhangLiu", "DezhiZheng", "MingshengZheng", "YiZhao", "MingjunHu", "G HYue", "GuangcunShan"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ab0a50"}

The probe, 140 \u03bcm in diameter, can scan laterally up to 400 \u03bcm by means of a piezoelectric bender. Two different sampling rates are used, 10 kHz for high-resolution B-scan imaging, and 100 kHz for displacement measurements in order to span the auditory frequency range of gerbil (~50 kHz). Once the cochlear structures are recognized, the scanning range is gradually decreased and ultimately stopped with the probe pointing at the selected angle to measure the simultaneous displacements of multiple structures inside the organ of Corti (OC). The displacement measurement is based on spectral domain phase microscopy. The displacement noise level depends on the A-scan signal of the structure within the OC and we have attained levels as low as ~0.02 nm in in vivo measurements. The system's broadband infrared light source allows for an imaging depth of ~2.7 mm, and axial resolution of ~3 \u03bcm. In future development, the probe can be coupled with an electrode for time-locked voltage and displacement measurements in order to explore the electro-mechanical feedback loop that is key to cochlear processing.

Our hybrid piezoelectric-magnetostrictive transformer can take an input electric voltage that may include modulation-signal over a carrier frequency and transmit via oscillating magnetic field or flux change.

In particular, an implantable cardiac pacemaker is the most effective therapeutic device for treating bradyrhythmia, however its surgical replacement is inevitable every 5-12 years due to the limited life of the built-in battery. Although several approaches of energy harvesting have been explored in this decade for powering cardiac pacemakers, the modern, commercial, and full-function pacemaker has never been powered effectively yet. Here, we report an integrated strategy for directly powering a modern and full-function cardiac pacemaker, which can pace the porcine heart in vivo by harvesting the natural energy of a heartbeat, without using any external energy storage element. The generator includes an elastic skeleton and two piezoelectric composites, which could generate a high-output current of 15 \u03bcA in vivo over state-of-the-art performance.

{"title": "Development of A New Type of 2-DOF Piezo-Actuated Pseudo-Decoupled Compliant Mechanism for Elliptical Vibration Machining.", "abstract": "Currently, the elliptical vibration cutting/coining (EVC\u00b2) has been widely employed in fabricating various functional microstructure surfaces applied in many significant engineering fields. Therefore, for this study, a novel type of two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) piezoelectrically actuated pseudo-decoupled compliant mechanisms (PDCMs) with non-orthogonal decoupling structures, which can exactly generate the strict ellipse trajectories, was developed for improving the forming accuracies of the EVC\u00b2 microstructures. First, the compliance matrices of 2-DOF PDCMs were theoretically modeled using the popular finite beam-based matrix modeling (FBMM) and the matrix-based compliance modeling (MCM) methods, then finite element analysis (FEA) was adopted to verify the effectiveness of the built compliance model for the 2-DOF PDCM with arbitrary structure parameters. Second, the static FEA method was employed to systematically reveal the dependencies of the tracking accuracies of the elliptical trajectories on the decoupling structures of 2-DOF PDCMs. Moreover, their main dynamic performances were also investigated through the FEA-based harmonic response analysis and modal analysis. On these bases, the critical angle of the decoupling structure was optimally set at 102.5\u00b0 so that the PDCMs had minimum shape distortions of the ellipse trajectories. Thirdly, a series of experiments was conducted on this PDCM system for practically investigating its kinematic and dynamic performances. The actual aspect ratio between the major axis and minor axis of the ellipse trajectory was approximately 1.057, and the first-order and second-order resonant frequencies were 863 Hz and 1893 Hz, respectively. However, the obtained testing results demonstrated well the effectiveness and feasibility of 2-DOF PDCM systems in precisely tracking the ellipse trajectories with different geometric parameters.

Since the ultrasound wave is generated by the vibration of the two hemispheres, a matching layer is not required. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is used as the material of the hemispherical shells of the transducer. The shells were fabricated by laser sintering as an additive manufacturing method, in which the hemispheres were built layer by layer from a powder bed.

While these values might be acceptable for conventional operations, e.g., opening a folder, they must be boosted for applications where intensive operations are performed.

{"title": "Highly Sensitive Impact Sensor Based on PVDF-TrFE/Nano-ZnO Composite Thin Film.", "abstract": "A thin film of polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) has good flexibility and simple preparation process. More importantly, compared with PVDF, its piezoelectric \u03b2-phase can be easily formed without mechanical stretching. However, its piezoelectricity is relatively lower. Therefore, at present, PVDF-TrFE is always compounded with other kinds of piezoelectric materials to solve this problem. The effect of nano-ZnO doping amount on the sensing characteristics of the piezoelectric films was studied. PVDF-TrFE/nano-ZnO films with different nano-ZnO contents were prepared by spin coating process and packaged. The dispersion of nano-ZnO dopants and the crystallinity of \u03b2-phase in piezoelectric films with different nano-ZnO contents were observed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and the piezoelectric strain constants and dielectric constants were measured, respectively. The effect of different nano-ZnO contents on the output performance of the piezoelectric sensor was obtained by a series of impact experiments. The results show that the piezoelectric strain constant and dielectric constant can be increased by doping nano-ZnO in PVDF-TrFE. Moreover, the doping amount of nano-ZnO in PVDF-TrFE is of great significance for improving the piezoelectric properties of PVDF-TrFE/nano-ZnO thin films. Among the prepared piezoelectric films, the output voltage of PVDF-TrFE/nano-ZnO piezoelectric sensor with 7.5% nano-ZnO doping amount is about 5.5 times that of pure PVDF-TrFE.

TiO\u2082 embedded poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/PMMA photocatalytic membranes were prepared by phase inversion method. A non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) coupled with vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) was used to fabricate flat-sheet membranes using a dope solution consisting of PMMA, PVDF, TiO\u2082, and triethyl phosphate (TEP) as an alternative non-toxic solvent. Membrane morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Backscatter electron detector (BSD) mapping was used to monitor the inter-dispersion of TiO\u2082 in the membrane surface and matrix. The effects of polymer concentration, evaporation time, additives and catalyst amount on the membrane morphology and properties were investigated.

{"title": "Analytical Modeling and Experimental Validation of an Energy Harvesting System for the Smart Plate with an Integrated Piezo-Harvester.", "abstract": "The literature on piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) is strongly focused on structures, like cantilever beams with piezoceramic layers, due to the fact that they are easily modelled and implemented. As compared to the number of studies dealing with the aforementioned case, research on 2D structures with an attached piezoceramic patch harvester is very limited. Thus, an analytical modeling and experimental validations of a piezo harvester structurally integrated on a thin plate with SFSF (Simply supported-Free-Simply supported-Free) boundary conditions is presented in this paper. The distributed parameter electroelastic model of a harvester bonded to an aluminum plate with both piezo-patch actuators is developed on the basis of the Kirchhoff plate theory and the modal analysis for physical and modal coordinates. This allows to estimate the steady-state value output voltage for each odd mode in the frequency range of 10\u207b300 Hz.

Moreover, the on-line monitoring method is potentially useful to improve their safety. A waveguide bar system can enable monitoring of critical equipment working in elevated temperature using reliable ultrasonic technology. Among the waveguide bar system, the matching mechanism of the transducer and the waveguide bar is crucial to propagate the pure fundamental quasi-shear mode (shorten for SH0*) wave. In the present research, the loading line sources that can excite pure SH0* wave are investigated and the anti-plane shear loading source is selected. The critical values about the geometric dimensions of the junctions between the piezoelectric transducer and the waveguide bar are explored by simulation and experiments. On the condition that the excitation sources satisfy the critical values, the loading can be approximated to an anti-plane shear one to excite the pure SH0* wave. Some waveguide bar systems are designed based on the simulated critical values and some experiments at high temperature are carried out. The experimental results verify that the designed waveguide bar systems can excite the pure SH0* wave at elevated temperatures, which verify the reliability of the simulated critical results.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-02-20", "authors": ["JiuhongJia", "ZuoyuLiao", "XiaotaoCai", "YunTu", "Shan-TungTu"], "doi": "10.3390/s19040793\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.12.005\n10.1115/1.1425808\n10.1177/1475921716642747\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/1/029\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.03.008\n10.1016/j.ultras.2013.09.023\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.07.011\n10.1177/1475921716673567\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.07.016\n10.1063/1.4863639\n10.1177/1045389X03038577\n10.1016/j.jsv.2013.09.010\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1504027\n10.1016/j.net.2017.05.002\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.12.049\n10.1121/1.2968677\n10.1063/1.4959005\n10.1142/S0219455415500418\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/11/11LT01\n10.1063/1.4948473\n10.1121/1.2908273\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1782"}

However, many solar evaporation devices still show unsatisfactory performance and suffer from inefficient utilization of absorbed solar energy.

This prediction is confirmed through using a bilayered solar steam generation architecture [hollow glass microsphere-carbon black (HS-CB)] both in laboratory- and pilot-scale studies. The HS-CB consists of a CB film as a solar-thermal conversion layer and three-dimensional hierarchical polyvinylidene fluoride skeleton cross-linking HSs as a heat localization and water-transporting layer.

With this method, elongated spermatids are collected from testicular tissues and are easier to obtain from animals that unexpectedly die than ejaculate sperm.

To develop assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) for domestic cats, we examined the effects of oocyte activation on cleavage and embryo development after Piezo-ICSI with motile sperm (experiment 1) and after Piezo-ICSI with either testicular sperm or elongated spermatids (experiment 2). In experiment 1, the proportions of cleaved embryos, morulas, and blastocysts following Piezo-ICSI with ethanol activation were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the non-activated groups. However, the proportion of blastocysts and the blastocyst quality did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) between the ethanol-activated and non-activated groups. In experiment 2, the cleavage frequencies of oocytes after Piezo-ICSI of testicular sperm or elongated spermatids and ethanol activation were higher (P < 0.05) than that of oocytes in the non-activated group, but the occurrence of blastocyst formation and quality of blastocysts did not differ between the activated and non-activated groups. In summary, cat embryos can be produced by Piezo-actuated microinjection of elongated spermatids. Ethanol activation increased the frequency of cleavage, but it affected neither the occurrence of blastocyst development nor the quality of blastocysts.

{"title": "Mechanosensitive meningeal nociception via Piezo channels: Implications for pulsatile pain in migraine?", "abstract": "Recent discovery of mechanosensitive Piezo receptors in trigeminal ganglia suggested the novel molecular candidate for generation of migraine pain. However, the contribution of Piezo channels in migraine pathology was not tested yet. Therefore, in this study, we explored a potential involvement of Piezo channels in peripheral trigeminal nociception implicated in generation of migraine pain.\nWe used immunohistochemistry, calcium imaging, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) release assay and electrophysiology in mouse and rat isolated trigeminal neurons and rat hemiskulls to study action of various stimulants of Piezo receptors on migraine-related peripheral nociception.\nWe found that essential (35%) fraction of isolated rat trigeminal neurons responded to chemical Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 and about a half of Yoda1 positive neurons responded to hypo-osmotic solution (HOS) and a quarter to mechanical stimulation by focused ultrasound (US). In ex vivo hemiskull preparation, Yoda1 and HOS largely activated persistent nociceptive firing in meningeal branches of trigeminal nerve. By using our novel cluster analysis of pain spikes, we demonstrated that 42% of fibers responded to Piezo1 agonist and 20% of trigeminal fibers were activated by Yoda1 and by capsaicin, suggesting expression of Piezo receptors in TRPV1 positive peptidergic nociceptive nerve fibers. Consistent with this, Yoda1 promoted the release of the key migraine mediator CGRP from hemiskull preparation.\nTaken together, our data suggest the involvement of mechanosensitive Piezo receptors, in particular, Piezo1 subtype in peripheral trigeminal nociception, which provides a new view on mechanotransduction in migraine pathology and suggests novel molecular targets for anti-migraine medicine.", "journal": "Neuropharmacology", "date": "2019-02-16", "authors": ["NikitaMikhailov", "JarkkoLeskinen", "IlkkaFagerlund", "EkaterinaPoguzhelskaya", "RaisaGiniatullina", "OlegGafurov", "TarjaMalm", "TeroKarjalainen", "OlliGr\u00f6hn", "RashidGiniatullin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuropharm.2019.02.015"}

The wound was covered by artificial dermis with; (i) fresh ADRCs, (ii) frozen ADRCs, and (iii) PBS (control). The assessment for wound healing was performed by morphological, histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses.\nIn\u00a0vivo analyses exhibited the significant therapeutic effect of frozen ADRCs on burn wound healing up to the similar or higher level of fresh ADRCs. There were significant differences of wound closure, epithelized tissue thickness, and neovascularization between the treatment groups and control group. Although there was no significant difference of therapeutic efficacy between fresh ADRC group and frozen ADRC group, frozen ADRCs improved burn wound healing process in dermal regeneration with increased great type I collagen synthesis compared with fresh ADRCs.\nThese findings indicate that frozen ADRCs allow us to apply not only quickly but also for multiple times, and the cryopreserved ADRCs could therefore be useful for the treatment of burn wounds in clinical settings.", "journal": "Regenerative therapy", "date": "2019-02-16", "authors": ["YasuhikoKaita", "TakehikoTarui", "HideakiYoshino", "TakeakiMatsuda", "YoshihiroYamaguchi", "TakatoshiNakagawa", "MichioAsahi", "MasaakiIi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.reth.2019.01.001"}

First, starting in a frequency domain, the anisotropic dispersion is exactly incorporated into the constitutive relationship, thus avoiding fractional derivatives in a time domain. Then, based on the Radon transform, the original three-dimensional differential equation is effectively reduced to a one-dimensional system in space. Furthermore, inspired by the strategy adopted in the characteristic analysis of hyperbolic equations, the eigenvector diagonalization method is applied to decouple the one-dimensional vector problem into several independent scalar equations. Consequently, the fundamental solutions are easily obtained. A further derivation shows that Green's function can be decomposed into circumferential and spherical integrals, corresponding to static and transient responses, respectively. The procedures shown in this study are also compatible with other pertinent multi-physics coupling problems, such as piezoelectric, magneto-electro-elastic and thermo-elastic materials.

{"title": "Establishment and Verification of the Cutting Grinding Force Model for the Disc Wheel Based on Piezoelectric Sensors.", "abstract": "In this paper, a new model of cutting grinding force for disc wheels is presented. Initially, it was proposed that the grinding cutting force was formed by the grinding force and cutting force in combination. Considering the single-grit morphology, the single-grit average grinding depth, the effective number of grits, and the contact arc length between the grit and the workpiece comprehensively, the grinding force model and the cutting force model were established, respectively. Then, a universal grinding cutting force model was optimized by introducing the effective grit coefficient model, dependent on the probability statistical method and the grit height coefficient model with Rayleigh's distribution theory. Finally, according to the different proportions of the grinding force and cutting force, the grinding cutting force model, with multi-particles, was established. Simulation and experimental results based on piezoelectric sensors showed that the proposed model could predict the intermittent grinding cutting force well. Moreover, the inclusion of the grit height coefficient and the effective grits number coefficient improved the modeling accuracy.

{"title": "Direct observation of shift and ballistic photovoltaic currents.", "abstract": "The quantum phenomenon of shift photovoltaic current was predicted decades ago, but this effect was never observed directly because shift and ballistic currents coexist. The atomic-scale relaxation time of shift, along with the absence of a photo-Hall behavior, has made decisive measurement of shift elusive. Here, we report a facile, direct-current, steady-state method for unambiguous determination of shift by means of the simultaneous measurements of linear and circular bulk photovoltaic currents under magnetic field, in a sillenite piezoelectric crystal. Comparison with theoretical predictions permits estimation of the signature length scale for shift. Remarkably, shift and ballistic photovoltaic currents under monochromatic illumination simultaneously flow in opposite directions. Disentangling the shift and ballistic contributions opens the way for quantitative, fundamental insight into and practical understanding of these radically different photovoltaic current mechanisms and their relationship.", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2019-02-13", "authors": ["Aaron MBurger", "RadheAgarwal", "AlexeyAprelev", "EdwardSchruba", "AlejandroGutierrez-Perez", "Vladimir MFridkin", "Jonathan ESpanier"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.aau5588"}

{"title": "Two-degrees-of-freedom PI", "abstract": "The fast and accurate tracking of periodic and arbitrary reference trajectories is the principal goal in many nanopositioning applications. Flexure-based piezoelectric stack driven nanopositioners are widely employed in applications where accurate mechanical displacements at these nanometer scales are required. The performance of these nanopositioners is limited by the presence of lightly damped resonances in their dynamic response and actuator nonlinearities. Closed-loop control techniques incorporating both damping and tracking are typically used to address these limitations. However, most tracking schemes employed use a first-order integrator where a triangular trajectory commonly used in nanopositioning applications necessitates a double integral for zero-error tracking. The phase margin of the damped system combined with the hardware-induced delay deem the implementation of a double-integrator unstable. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents the design, analysis and application of a new control scheme based on the structure of the traditional Two-Degrees-of-Freedom PID controller (2DOF-PID).

{"title": "Magnetoelectric Transducer Designs for Use as Wireless Power Receivers in Wearable and Implantable Applications.", "abstract": "As the size of biomedical implants and wearable devices becomes smaller, the need for methods to deliver power at higher power densities is growing. The most common method to wirelessly deliver power, inductively coupled coils, suffers from poor power density for very small-sized receiving coils. An alternative strategy is to transmit power wirelessly to magnetoelectric (ME) or mechano-magnetoelectric (MME) receivers, which can operate efficiently at much smaller sizes for a given frequency. This work studies the effectiveness of ME and MME transducers as wireless power receivers for biomedical implants of very small (<2 mm\u00b3) size. The comparative study clearly demonstrates that under existing safety standards, the ME architecture is able to generate a significantly higher power density than the MME architecture. Analytical models for both types of transducers are developed and validated using centimeter scale devices.

{"title": "The contribution of fluoropolymer thermolysis to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in environmental media.", "abstract": "The source of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) has long been a controversial issue. Fluoropolymer thermolysis is expected to be a potential anthropogenic source except for CFC alternatives. However, its TFA yield and contributions have rarely been reported more recently. In this study, we investigated the thermal properties of three kinds of fluoropolymers, including poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-CTFE) and poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE). A laboratory simulation experiment was then performed to analyze the TFA levels in the thermolysis products and hence to examine the TFA yields of these fluoropolymers. Thermolysis of these fluoropolymers occurred in the temperature ranges from \u223c400\u202f\u00b0C to \u223c650\u202f\u00b0C, with the peak weight loss rate at around 550-600\u202f\u00b0C. TFA could be produced through fluoropolymer thermolysis when being heated to 500\u202f\u00b0C and above. Average TFA yields of PTFE, PVDF-HFP and PVDF-CTFE were 1.2%, 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the contribution of fluoropolymer thermolysis and CFC alternatives to rainwater TFA in Beijing, China was evaluated by using a Two-Box model.

They typically require sophisticated equipment and expensive fluorescent probes, rendering them not widely available for rapid acute infection diagnoses at the point of care to ensure timely treatment of the diseases. Here we report a rapid genetic detection method that can detect the bacterial gene directly from patient stools using a piezoelectric plate sensor (PEPS) in conjunction with a continuous flow system with two temperature zones. With stools spiked with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in situ bacteria lysing and DNA denaturation occurred in the high-temperature zone whereas in situ specific detection of the denatured DNA by the PEPS occurred in the lower-temperature zone. The outcome was a rapid genetic detection method that directly detected bacterial genes from stool in <\u202f40\u202fmin without the need of gene isolation, gene amplification, or expensive fluorescent tag but with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sensitivity. In 40 blinded patient stools, it detected the toxin B gene of Clostridium difficile with 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

{"title": "Blurring the boundary between open abdomen treatment and ventral hernia repair.", "abstract": "Therapeutic approaches for septic open abdomen treatment remain a major challenge with many uncertainties. The most convincing method is vacuum-assisted wound closure with mesh-mediated fascia traction with a protective plastic sheet placed on the viscera. As this plastic sheet and the mesh must be removed before final fascial closure, such a technique only allows temporary abdominal closure. This retrospective study analyzes the results of a modification of this technique allowing final abdominal closure using an anti-adhesive permeable polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh.\nThe outcome of all consecutive patients with septic open abdomen treatment at one academic surgical department from January 2013 to June 2015 was retrospectively analyzed.\nRetrospectively, 57 severely ill consecutive patients with septic open abdomen treatment with a 30-day mortality of 26% and a 2-year mortality of 51% were included in the study. In 26 patients, no mesh was implanted; in 31 patients, mesh implantation was done at median third-look laparotomy, median 5\u00a0days postoperative. Re-laparotomies after mesh implantation (median n\u2009=\u20092) revealed anastomotic leakage in 16% but no new bowel fistula. In 40% of those patients who had mesh implantation, fascia closure was not achieved and the mesh was left in place in a bridging position avoiding planned ventral hernia.\nThe application of an anti-adhesive PVDF mesh for fascia traction in vacuum-assisted wound closure of septic open abdomen is novel, versatile, and seems to be safe.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these mechanotransduction processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that deletion of the mechanically activated and rapidly adapting Piezo2 channel in a portion of the low-threshold mechanoreceptors and a majority of the IB4-positive nociceptors impairs touch but sensitizes mechanical pain in mice. Ectopic expression of the Piezo2 homolog, the intermediately adapting Piezo1 channel, in sensory neurons can sensitize touch in normal mice and rescue defective touch of the Piezo2-knockout mice. Broad expression of Piezo1 in sensory neurons decreases, rather than evokes, mechanical pain responses. Together, our data suggest that Piezo channels can mediate touch and indirectly suppress acute pain.

In Drosophila, the chordotonal organs (Cho) are especially important in the regulation of locomotion pattern. However, how Cho neurons that are normally activated with sound (vibration) transduce static displacement caused by body position change remains unclear. Here, we report that piezo-like (pzl), a homolog for mammalian piezo1 and 2, is essential for Cho's function in locomotion. The mutant allele of pzl showed severe defects in crawling pattern and body gesture control, which were rescued by expressing Pzl specifically in Cho neurons. The ability of Cho neurons to respond to micrometer-scale body wall displacement requires pzl.

The fabricated MFP surface was press-focused using a computer numerical control (CNC) machining tool-customized multi-spherical pattern object. The multi-spherical pattern has five spherical surfaces with equal area and connected continuously to have the same energy level at focal points. Center points of these spheres are distributed in a linear pattern with 1 mm distance between each two points. The radius of these spheres increases steadily from 10 mm to 13.86 mm. The designed MFP transducer had a center frequency of 50 MHz and a -6 dB bandwidth of 68%. The wire phantom test was conducted to study and demonstrate the advantages of this novel design. The obtained results for MFP transducer revealed a significant increase (4.3 mm) of total focal zone in the near-field and far-field area compared with 0.48 mm obtained using the conventional single focal point transducer.

In this paper, stroboscopic opto-electronic holography is used to quantify motions of the entire TM surface induced by forward sound and reverse mechanical stimulation in human cadaveric ears from 0.25 to 18.4\u2009kHz. The forward sound stimulus was coupled to an anatomically realistic artificial ear canal that allowed optical access to the entire TM surface, and the reverse mechanical stimulus was applied to the body of the incus by a piezo-electric stimulator. The results show clear differences in TM surface motions evoked by the two stimuli. In the forward case, TM motion is dominated by standing-wave-like modal motions that are consistent with a relatively uniform sound-pressure load over the entire TM surface. With reverse mechanical stimulation, the TM surface shows more traveling waves, consistent with a localized mechanical drive applied to the manubrium embedded in the TM. With both stimuli, the manubrium moves less than the rest of the TM, consistent with the TM acting like a compliant membrane rather than a stiff diaphragm, and also consistent with catenary behavior due to the TM's curved shape.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2019-02-04", "authors": ["Jeffrey TaoCheng", "NimaMaftoon", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mieGuignard", "Michael ERavicz", "JohnRosowski"], "doi": "10.1121/1.5087134\n10.1109/83.902291\n10.1016/j.heares.2009.12.024\n10.1121/1.4773263\n10.1007/s10162-015-0516-x\n10.1016/j.heares.2011.04.015\n10.1016/j.heares.2014.03.002\n10.1016/j.heares.2015.12.002\n10.1016/j.heares.2009.10.014\n10.1016/j.heares.2015.10.016\n10.1152/jn.01214.2005\n10.1002/sca.20283\n10.1023/B:ABME.0000030260.22737.53\n10.1121/1.3613934\n10.1016/0262-8856(88)90016-9\n10.1177/000348947808700326\n10.1121/1.4886816\n10.1121/1.1910465\n10.1117/1.3153898\n10.1117/1.OE.52.10.101916\n10.1016/j.heares.2016.03.005\n10.1121/1.410160\n10.1007/s10162-014-0442-3\n10.1016/S0378-5955(97)00015-4\n10.1016/j.heares.2017.01.007\n10.1121/1.2817358\n10.2514/3.21092\n10.1016/j.heares.2009.12.015\n10.1121/1.1564018\n10.1121/1.423930\n10.1121/1.4898420\n10.1121/1.4988752\n10.1121/1.404280\n10.1016/j.heares.2009.03.010\n10.1097/AUD.0b013e31815d63a5\n10.1121/1.401295\n10.1121/1.392797\n10.1121/1.1913236\n10.1121/1.1785832\n10.1016/S0378-5955(02)00632-9"}

The drawback of the tumor image in a mammogram is the lack of tumor depth information as it is only a 2-dimensional projection of a 3-dimensional (3D) tumor.

The locations of the top and bottom surfaces of an inclusion were resolved by solving a simple spring model using the elastic measurements of the PEFs of different probe sizes as the input. The lateral sizes of an inclusion were determined as the full width at half maximum of the Gaussian fit to the measured lateral tumor elastic modulus profile. The obtained lateral inclusion sizes were in close agreement with the actual values, and the deduced depth profiles of an inclusion also agreed with the actual depth profiles so long as the bottom surface of the inclusion was within the depth sensitivity of the PEF with the largest probe size.

Local measurement of chemical properties with high-resolution has gained much popularity in recent years with advances in dynamic AFM methodologies. A calibration factor is required to convert the electrical readout to a mechanical oscillation amplitude in order to extract quantitative information about the surface. We propose a new calibration technique for the oscillation amplitude of electrically driven probes using the principle of energy balance. Our technique relies on the measurement of the energy input to maintain the oscillation amplitude constant. With the measurement of the energy input to the probe, a mechanical oscillation amplitude is calculated and a calibration factor to convert the electrical readout in volts to a mechanical oscillation amplitude in \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms is obtained. We demonstrate the application of the new technique with a quartz tuning fork including the qPlus configuration, while the same principle can be applied to other piezoelectric resonators such as length extension resonators or piezoelectric cantilevers.

{"title": "An articulated finger driven by single-mode piezoelectric actuator for compact and high-precision robot hand.", "abstract": "In this paper, a novel finger driven by single-mode piezoelectric actuator for a compact and high-precision robot hand is proposed. Three piezoelectric actuators are articulated by two sets of connecting elements to form the finger. The finger utilizes a single model of the piezoelectric actuator to generate friction force to drive the joint. Without the difficulty to adjust for the coincidence of modal frequencies, the design of the piezoelectric actuator has fewer restrictions on size and structure; thus, the finger has a compact structure. The bidirectional motion of the joint is achieved by changing the temporal phase difference of two excitation signals applied on the two adjacent piezoelectric actuators. In addition, due to the characteristics of piezoelectric drive, such as power cut self-locking and quick response, the finger has a high resolution to realize micromanipulation for high precise movement. In our design, the first order longitudinal vibration mode of the piezoelectric actuator is used to generate the friction force. By using a finite element model, the geometric parameters of the piezoelectric actuator are obtained. A prototype of the finger is fabricated and experimentally investigated, the size (111 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 mm) is approximately 1.5 times that of a human middle finger, and the weight is 0.11 kg.

{"title": "Damage Detection of Asphalt Concrete Using Piezo-Ultrasonic Wave Technology.", "abstract": "Asphalt concrete has been widely used in road engineering as a surface material. Meanwhile, ultrasonic testing technology has also been developed rapidly. Aiming to evaluate the feasibility of the ultrasonic wave method, the present work reports a laboratory investigation on damage detection of asphalt concrete using piezo-ultrasonic wave technology. The gradation of AC-13 was selected and prepared based on the Marshall's design. The ultrasonic wave velocities of samples were tested with different environmental conditions firstly. After that, the samples were destroyed into two types, one was drilled and the other was grooved. And the ultrasonic wave velocities of pretreated samples were tested again. Furthermore, the relationship between velocity and damaged process was evaluated based on three point bending test. The test results indicated that piezoelectric ultrasonic wave is a promising technology for damage detection of asphalt concrete with considerable benefits. The ultrasonic velocity decreases with the voidage increases. In a saturated water environment, the measured velocity of ultrasonic wave increased. In a dry environment (50 \u00b0C), the velocity the ultrasonic waves increased too. After two freeze-thaw cycles, the voidage increased and the ultrasonic velocity decreased gradually. After factitious damage, the wave must travel through or most likely around the damage, the ultrasonic velocity decreased.

{"title": "A Chair-Based Unconstrained/Nonintrusive Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring System Using a Two-Channel Ballistocardiogram.", "abstract": "Hypertension is a well-known chronic disease that causes complications such as cardiovascular diseases or stroke, and thus needs to be continuously managed by using a simple system for measuring blood pressure. The existing method for measuring blood pressure uses a wrapping cuff, which makes measuring difficult for patients. To address this problem, cuffless blood pressure measurement methods that detect the peak pressure via signals measured using photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors and use it to calculate the pulse transit time (PTT) or pulse wave velocity (PWV) have been studied. However, a drawback of these methods is that a user must be able to recognize and establish contact with the sensor. Furthermore, the peak of the PPG or ECG cannot be detected if the signal quality drops, leading to a decrease in accuracy. In this study, a chair-type system that can monitor blood pressure using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films in a nonintrusive manner to users was developed. The proposed method also uses instantaneous phase difference (IPD) instead of PTT as the feature value for estimating blood pressure. Experiments were conducted using a blood pressure estimation model created via an artificial neural network (ANN), which showed that IPD could estimate more accurate readings of blood pressure compared to PTT, thus demonstrating the possibility of a nonintrusive blood pressure monitoring system.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-02-03", "authors": ["Kwang JinLee", "JongryunRoh", "DongraeCho", "JoonhoHyeong", "SayupKim"], "doi": "10.3390/s19030595\n10.1016/j.irbm.2014.07.002\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2180019\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2441951\n10.1038/s41598-017-11507-3\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2580904\n10.1109/TIM.2013.2287118\n10.3390/s150203224\n10.1016/j.compind.2017.05.005\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2440291\n10.1109/JBHI.2016.2614962\n10.1098/rspa.1998.0193\n10.1016/j.bspc.2016.10.014\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2009.10.006"}

{"title": "Insight into Pain Modulation: Nociceptors Sensitization and Therapeutic Targets.", "abstract": "Pain is a complex multidimensional concept that facilitates the initiation of the signaling cascade in response to any noxious stimuli. Action potential generation in the peripheral nociceptor terminal and its transmission through various types of nociceptors corresponding to mechanical, chemical or thermal stimuli lead to the activation of receptors and further neuronal processing produces the sensation of pain. Numerous types of receptors are activated in pain sensation which vary in their signaling pathway. These signaling pathways can be regarded as a site for modulation of pain by targeting the pain transduction molecules to produce analgesia. On the basis of their anatomic location, transient receptor potential ion channels (TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8), Piezo 2, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), purinergic (P2X and P2Y), bradykinin (B1 and B2), \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), metabotropic glutamate (mGlu), neurokinin 1 (NK1) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors are activated during pain sensitization. Various inhibitors of TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPM8, Piezo 2, ASICs, P2X, P2Y, B1, B2, AMPA, NMDA, mGlu, NK1 and CGRP receptors have shown high therapeutic value in experimental models of pain. Similarly, local inhibitory regulation by the activation of opioid, adrenergic, serotonergic and cannabinoid receptors has shown analgesic properties by modulating the central and peripheral perception of painful stimuli. This review mainly focused on various classes of nociceptors involved in pain transduction, transmission and modulation, site of action of the nociceptors in modulating pain transmission pathways and the drugs (both clinical and preclinical data, relevant to targets) alleviating the painful stimuli by exploiting nociceptor-specific channels and receptors.", "journal": "Current drug targets", "date": "2019-02-02", "authors": ["AmnaKhan", "SalmanKhan", "Yeong ShikKim"], "doi": "10.2174/1389450120666190131114244"}

It excites the local electromechanical response of collagen via a sequence of distinct frequencies, minimizing crosstalk with topography, followed by principal component analysis to remove the background noise and simple harmonic oscillator model for physical analysis and data reconstruction. These enable us to acquire high fidelity mappings of fine electromechanical response at the nanoscale that correlate with the gap and overlap domains of collagen fibrils, which show substantial improvement over conventional piezoresponse force microscopy techniques.

As for the traditional planar heterojunction interface, their limited optical absorption will place restrictions on the full photoelectric potential of ZnO nanorods, which severely restrains the commercial applications of ZnO-based photodetectors. Herein, using an intrinsically octahedral structure of p-type Cu2O and one-dimensional ZnO arrays, the newly designed serrate-structured heterojunction was constructed, whose unique serrate-structured interface of ZnO/Cu2O is highly conducive to the aggrandizing of optical absorption. The as-fabricated photodetector could achieve a high on/off ratio up to 1000 and an optimum photocurrent of 24.90 \u03bcA under 1.41 mW mm-2 (405 nm) illumination without bias voltage, which was 2.5 times higher than that of the planar-structured photodetector, and the response time was as quick as 1.6 ms. When the additional external strain was 0.39%, the performance was dramatically enhanced more than 5 times due to the synergism of the piezo-phototronic effect and the serrate-structured design.

{"title": "Study of Fiber-Based Wearable Energy Systems.", "abstract": "Fiber-based electronic and photonic devices have the most desired human-friendly features, such as being soft, ubiquitous, flexible, stretchable, light, and permeable, and thus are ideal to be employed as the interface platform between humans, the environment, and machines. Today, these smart wearable devices are normally powered by rechargeable batteries. It is extremely desirable to have an undisrupted power supply for us to go anywhere at any time. Harvesting energy from the ambient environment or our body can potentially fulfill such a goal. Explorations of high performance, flexible functional materials and energy conversion devices have led many exiting discoveries. In order to realize their applications, equally important are fundamental studies of the physical phenomena and mechanisms that will provide scientific guidance for the direction of exploration and development of devices and systems. Hence, this Account provides a brief review of our recent progress in this topic area. Based upon materials science, mechanics and device physics, we have succeeded in establishment of several new theoretical models for fiber-based piezoelectric, triboelectric, and hybrid generators. These models have been verified experimentally. Excellent results were obtained for fiber-based triboelectric generators without any adjustable parameters. Reasonable agreement was demonstrated for the piezoelectric generators because of some uncertainty in the material properties and deformation modes. From both simulated and experimental results, we did not detect any synergic effect in the hybrid generator consisting of cascaded piezoelectric and triboelectric units. The verified models can be used to predict the output voltage, current, and power of the devices in terms of material properties, parameters of device structure, harvesting circuits, and operating conditions. Furthermore, by considering the electric breakdown due to field-induced-emission and gas-ionization, we have identified the theoretical upper limits of charge density and output power from contact-mode fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerators. The analysis sheds new light on the scope and focus for further exploration and provides guidance on engineering design of such devices. In addition, we have setup an experimental platform for reliable triboelectric charge measurement of highly deformable and porous materials like fabrics. An extended triboelectric series has been reported by us including 21 types of commercial and new fibers. Based upon the findings, we have made significant improvements of the performance of these energy harvesting devices. Finally, we have explored a class of new flexible thermoelectric materials exhibiting high performance for fiber-based thermoelectric generators, which can be fabricated by low-temperature and cost-effective processes, such as in situ reduction coating and three-dimensional printing. The resultant large-area, flexible, and wearable fiber-base thermoelectric generators are key devices for great potential applications such as powering wearable microelectronic systems, active microclimate regulating systems, and waste thermal energy harvesting.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2019-01-31", "authors": ["XiaomingTao"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00502"}

The elastic modes are derived with an analytical method of linear piezoelectricity based on a bimorph piezoelectric deformable mirror (BPDM), and the three-dimensional formulas of elastic modes are presented. Here a BPDM with an aperture of 165 mm as an example is numerically studied. Two different kinds of dynamic boundary conditions are considered, and the dependence of the elastic modes aberrations upon the orders and rotational symmetries is evaluated. Besides, a comparative study for elastic mode and Zernike polynomials is presented in the numerical analysis. The results have demonstrated that the elastic mode method can be not only used instead of Zernike polynomials, but also more effective to decompose arbitrary wave-front errors of a deformable mirror. Furthermore, finite element analysis method is used to validate the analytic method. The conclusions have shown reasonably consistent results between the two methods.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2019-01-31", "authors": ["HairenWang", "MingzhuZhang", "YingxiZuo", "XianzhongZheng"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.27.000404"}
{"title": "Piezoelectric Transducer-Based Structural Health Monitoring for Aircraft Applications.", "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is being widely evaluated by the aerospace industry as a method to improve the safety and reliability of aircraft structures and also reduce operational cost. Built-in sensor networks on an aircraft structure can provide crucial information regarding the condition, damage state and/or service environment of the structure. Among the various types of transducers used for SHM, piezoelectric materials are widely used because they can be employed as either actuators or sensors due to their piezoelectric effect and vice versa. This paper provides a brief overview of piezoelectric transducer-based SHM system technology developed for aircraft applications in the past two decades. The requirements for practical implementation and use of structural health monitoring systems in aircraft application are then introduced. State-of-the-art techniques for solving some practical issues, such as sensor network integration, scalability to large structures, reliability and effect of environmental conditions, robust damage detection and quantification are discussed.

{"title": "Active Vibration Control of a Piezo-Bonded Laminated Composite in the Presence of Sensor Partial Debonding and Structural Delaminations.", "abstract": "In this paper, the active vibration control of a piezo-bonded laminated composite is investigated in the presence of sensor partial debonding and structural delamination. Improved layerwise theory, higher-order electric potential field, and the finite-element method were employed to develop an electromechanically coupled model for the two types of damage (i.e., sensor partial debonding and delamination). The developed model was numerically implemented on a single-input-multi-output (SIMO) system to demonstrate the effects of sensor partial debonding and structural delamination on the ability of a constant gain velocity feedback (CGVF) controller to attenuate vibration. The two types of damage were assessed in terms of controlled outputs of the sensors, nodal displacements, and control input signals being applied to the actuator to suppress vibrations. The obtained results showed that the sensor partial debonding and structural delamination have opposite effects on the vibration-attenuation characteristics of the CGVF controller. The presence of partial debonding in the sensor made the controller less able to suppress vibrations because of a spurious sensing signal, whereas structural delamination increased the control authority of the controller because of the loss of structural stiffness that results from structural delamination.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-31", "authors": ["AsifKhan", "Heung SooKim"], "doi": "10.3390/s19030540\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.11.026\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/4/033\n10.3390/s18124137\n10.3390/s17092001\n10.3390/s130302997\n10.1177/1045389X17692052\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2007.10.030\n10.1080/15376494.2018.1512021\n10.1177/1475921706067740\n10.2514/2.7295\n10.1177/0731684415593815\n10.1016/0961-9526(91)90039-U\n10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.10.002\n10.1098/rsta.2011.0441\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2013.12.016\n10.1016/0020-7683(94)00229-P\n10.2514/3.9792\n10.2514/3.10984\n10.1088/1361-665X/aacc95\n10.1016/S1359-8368(96)00043-1\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2008.04.018\n10.1007/s12206-018-0122-4\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/8/085018\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/1/015052\n10.1016/j.jsv.2008.05.037\n10.2514/3.10451\n10.1016/S0263-8231(00)00013-6\n10.2514/1.J053166\n10.1080/15376494.2017.1387324\n10.1177/1045389X12463465\n10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.04.068\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2007.00302.x\n10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:11(1222)\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/5/012\n10.1007/s12541-015-0109-y\n10.1016/S0020-7683(01)00180-9\n10.1016/S0045-7949(03)00150-0\n10.2514/2.1596\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.01.004\n10.1117/12.649573"}

This pilot study evaluated the effects of contingent vibratory feedback stimuli using an occlusal splint for inhibition of sleep bruxism.\nThirteen subjects with clinically diagnosed SB participated after providing an informed consent. Portable polysomnographic recordings were conducted in the subjects' home environment to make a definitive SB diagnosis and to evaluate the effects of the vibratory stimuli on SB. A force-based bruxism detection system, which used a pressure-sensitive piezoelectric film embedded in the occlusal splint, was utilized to trigger vibration feedback stimuli, which was scheduled to be applied intermittently for 30\u00a0min, at 30-min intervals.\nThe number of SB episodes (times/hour), the total SB duration (seconds/hour), the mean duration of SB episodes (seconds/episode), and the micro-arousal index (times/hour) were scored for each time period (with and without vibration). The effects of the vibration on these scores were tested (paired t test; p\u2009<\u20090.05).

However, it is still a critical challenge to effectively block Li dendrite growth and improve the long-term cycling stability of all-solid-state batteries with polymer electrolytes. Here, the interface between novel poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)-based solid electrolytes and the Li anode is explored via systematical experiments in combination with first-principles calculations, and it is found that an in situ formed nanoscale interface layer with a stable and uniform mosaic structure can suppress Li dendrite growth. Unlike the typical short-circuiting that often occurs in most studied poly(ethylene oxide) systems, this interface layer in the PVDF-based system causes an open-circuiting feature at high current density and thus avoids the risk of over-current.

{"title": "Maxillary osteotomy complications in piezoelectric surgery compared to conventional surgical techniques: a systematic review.", "abstract": "A systematic review was conducted to investigate the available evidence on maxillary complications related to piezoelectric and conventional surgery. Seven databases were searched. A total of 996 maxillary osteotomies were analysed, 864 performed with conventional tools and 132 with a piezoelectric device. One hundred and fifty-six complication events were reported. The complications, in descending order of overall prevalence, were as follows: neurosensory disturbance (64.7%), haemorrhage (8.3%), oroantral communication (7.7%), soft tissue injury (7.7%), tooth injury (5.1%), infection (3.2%), osteonecrosis (1.9%), and permanent nerve injury (1.3%). Among the complications, the results showed the highest prevalence for neurosensory disturbance, and haemorrhage was the most reported complication and the second most prevalent complication. A three-fold meta-analysis was performed. Using GRADEpro, the level of evidence was determined for each complication. The current low level of evidence suggests that piezoelectric bone surgery reduces critical and important complications during maxillary osteotomy procedures, such as neurosensory disturbance, haemorrhage, oroantral communication, tooth injury, and permanent nerve injury.

{"title": "A Quantitative Approach for the Bone-implant Osseointegration Assessment Based on Ultrasonic Elastic Guided Waves.", "abstract": "Quantitative and reliable monitoring of osseointegration will help further evaluate the integrity of the orthopaedic construct to promote novel prosthesis design and allow early mobilisation. Quantitative assessment of the degree or the lack of osseointegration is important for the clinical management with the introduction of prosthetic implants to amputees. Acousto-ultrasonic wave propagation has been used in structural health monitoring as well as human health monitoring but so far has not extended to osseointegrated implants or prostheses. This paper presents an ultrasonic guided wave approach to assess the osseointegration of a novel implant. This study explores the potential of integrating structural health monitoring concepts into a new osseointegrated implant. The aim is to demonstrate the extension of acousto-ultrasonic techniques, which have been widely reported for the structural health monitoring of engineering structures, to assess the state of osseointegration of a bone and implant. To illustrate this potential, this paper will report on the experimental findings which investigated the unification of an aluminium implant and bone-like geometry surrogate. The core of the test specimen is filled with silicone and wrapped with plasticine to simulate the highly damped cancellous bone and soft tissue, respectively. To simulate the osseointegration process, a 2-h adhesive epoxy is used to bond the surrogate implant and a bone-like structure. A series of piezoelectric elements are bonded onto the surrogate implant to serve as actuators and sensors. The actuating piezoelectric element on an extramedullary strut is excited with a 1 MHz pulse signal. The reception of the ultrasonic wave by the sensing elements located on the adjacent and furthest struts is used to assess the integration of this implant to the parent bone structure. The study shows an Osseointegration Index can be formulated by using engineering and acousto-ultrasonic methods to measure the unification of a bone and implant. This also highlights a potential quantitative evaluation technique regardless of bone-implant geometry and soft tissue damping.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-27", "authors": ["Benjamin StevenVien", "Wing KongChiu", "MatthiasRuss", "MarkFitzgerald"], "doi": "10.3390/s19030454\n10.1007/s13191-013-0252-z\n10.1002/jor.23376\n10.1080/03093640108726601\n10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.034\n10.1016/j.apmr.2013.05.020\n10.1080/09638288.2016.1186752\n10.2320/matertrans.M2011358\n10.1007/BF02344213\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.05.032\n10.1080/03093640308726667\n10.1682/JRRD.2008.06.0080\n10.1007/s00113-016-0302-1\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.01.029\n10.1016/S0021-9290(01)00072-0\n10.2106/00004623-199274070-00007\n10.12783/shm2017/14244\n10.1302/0301-620X.96B1.31905\n10.1016/j.ocl.2014.09.013\n10.1007/s11999-009-0986-4\n10.1007/s00264-007-0392-z\n10.2106/JBJS.J.00806\n10.3109/03091909009015420\n10.1155/2014/708574\n10.2106/JBJS.G.01556\n10.1002/jbm.820260111\n10.1007/s10439-007-9276-z\n10.1007/s10439-016-1769-1\n10.1111/ffe.12382\n10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.502\n10.1002/stc.1843\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2006.03.006\n10.1080/00218468608074943\n10.1177/1045389X09356026\n10.1080/09349840109409694\n10.1177/1045389X06059956\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.11.020\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/4/045014\n10.1016/S0041-624X(97)00038-3\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2018.11.002\n10.1016/j.jsv.2007.06.058\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2012.12.009\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.214301\n10.1063/1.4934493\n10.3390/s17051178\n10.3390/s16081273\n10.3390/s18124470\n10.3390/s16101737\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2006.02.001\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2007.04.017\n10.1097/00005373-197204000-00005\n10.1016/0021-9290(96)00054-1\n10.1109/TUFFC.2008.787\n10.3390/s140815067\n10.3390/s150305803\n10.3390/s7071224\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.07.011\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.10.008\n10.1121/1.3586788\n10.1177/1475921718782399\n10.1088/0967-3334/23/4/313\n10.1007/s00198-003-1528-7\n10.1016/S0020-1383(00)00126-1\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2015.04.006\n10.1302/0301-620X.83B4.11081\n10.1007/s11999-009-0752-7\n10.1302/0301-620X.76B3.8175839\n10.1002/jbm.a.31433\n10.1177/a037323\n10.1016/0021-9290(86)90128-4\n10.1016/0021-9290(77)90015-X\n10.1243/PIME_PROC_1995_209_337_02\n10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2010.01.002\n10.1152/jappl.2001.90.2.412\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1935\n10.1177/1475921710365267\n10.1016/j.ultras.2009.11.002"}

{"title": "Dramatically Enhanced Broadband Photodetection by Dual Inversion Layers and Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling.", "abstract": "Silicon photonics is now widely accepted as a key technology in a variety of systems. But owing to material limitations, now it is challenging to greatly improve the performance after decades of development. Here, we show a high-performance broadband photodetector with significantly enhanced sensitivity and responsivity operating over a wide wavelength range of light from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared at low power consumption. The specially designed textured top ceiling electrode works effectively as an antireflection layer to greatly improve the absorption of near-infrared light, thereby overcoming the absorption limitation of near-infrared light. Instead of the conventional p-n junction and p-intrinsic-n junction, we introduce a \u223c15 nm thick alumina insulator layer between a p-type Si substrate and n-type ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays, which significantly enhances the charge carrier separation and collection efficiency. The photosensing responsivity and sensitivity are found to be nearly 1 order of magnitude higher than that of a reference device of p-Si/n-ZnO NW arrays, significantly higher than the commercial silicon photodiodes as well. The light-induced charge carriers flow across the appropriate thickness of insulator layer via the quantum mechanical Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism. By virtue of the piezo-phototronic effect, the charge density at the interfaces can be tuned to alter the energy bands and the potential barrier distance for tunneling.

{"title": "Improved Piezoelectric Sensing Performance of P(VDF-TrFE) Nanofibers by Utilizing BTO Nanoparticles and Penetrated Electrodes.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric polymers with good flexibility have attracted tremendous attention in wearable sensors and energy harvesters. As the piezoelectricity of polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene [P(VDF-TrFE)] is lower than that of their ceramic counterparts, various approaches have been employed to improve the piezoelectric output of PVDF-based sensors, such as electrospinning, heat annealing, nanoconfinement, polymer blending, and nanoparticle addition. Here, we report two strategies to improve the piezoelectric sensing performance of polymer-based piezoelectric nanofibers, which include the formation of barium titanate (BTO)/P(VDF-TrFE) composite nanofibers and fabrication of penetrated electrodes to enlarge the interfacial area. BTO/P(VDF-TrFE) nanofibers with a BTO weight fraction of 5 wt % exhibit the maximum \u03b2-phase crystallinity and piezoelectricity. The piezoelectric output of the BTO/P(VDF-TrFE) nanofiber mat is significantly improved compared with that of pristine P(VDF-TrFE), which is confirmed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and compression loading tests.

Photocatalytic degradation attracts considerable attention because it is a promising strategy to treat pollutants from industrial and agricultural wastes. In recent years, other than the development of efficient photocatalysts, much effort has been devoted to the design of reliable and inexpensive photocatalytic platforms that work in various environment conditions. Here, we describe a novel photocatalytic platform that is able to float and freely move atop water while performing photodegradation. Compared to common platforms, such as slurry reactors and immobilized photoreactors, the proposed platform is advantageous in terms of easy recycling and energy saving. Furthermore, the special configuration resulting from a two-step synthesis route, semi-embedded photocatalysts, addresses some of the remaining challenges, for instance, the contamination from the loose photocatalysts themselves. For the probe pollutant, methylene blue (MB), a reproducible and remarkable degradation activity of the platform, is observed and the effect of two primary factors, including surface area of the catalyst and mass transfer rate, is investigated. Besides, the piezo-photocatalysis effect, serving as an additional functionality, is confirmed to further improve the degradability of the platform, which offers an additional 20% of degraded MB.

Our ab initio calculations for the neutral system reveal previously unknown stable 2D \u03f5-B and \u03c9-B structures. We find that the chemical bonding characteristic in this and other boron structures is strongly affected by extra charge. Beyond a critical degree of electron doping, the most stable allotrope changes from \u03f5-B to a buckled honeycomb structure. Additional electron doping, mimicking a transformation of boron to carbon, causes a gradual decrease in the degree of buckling of the honeycomb lattice that can be interpreted as piezoelectric response.

{"title": "Damage Quantification with Embedded Piezoelectric Aggregates Based on Wavelet Packet Energy Analysis.", "abstract": "Cement-based components have been widely used in civil engineering structures. However, due to wearing and deterioration, the cement-based components may have brittle failure. To provide early warning and to support predictive reinforcement, the piezoelectric materials are embedded into the cement-based components to excite and receive elastic waves. By recognizing the abnormalities in the elastic waves, hidden damage can be identified in advance. However, few research has been published regarding the damage quantification. In this paper, the wavelet packet analysis is adopted to calculate the energy of the transmitted elastic waves based on the improved piezoelectric aggregates (IPAs). Due to the growth of the damage, less elastic waves can pass through the damage zone, decreasing the energy of the acquired signals. A set of cement beams with different crack depths at the mid-span is tested in both numerical and experimental ways. A damage quantification index, namely the wavelet packet-based energy index (WPEI), is developed. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the WPEI decreases with respect to the crack depth. Based on the regression analysis, a strong linear relationship has been observed between the WPEI and the crack depth. By referring to the linear relationship, the crack depth can be estimated by the WPEI with a good accuracy. The results demonstrated that the use of the IPAs and the WPEI can fulfill the real-time quantification of the crack depth in the cement beams.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-24", "authors": ["ZijianWang", "LiWei", "MaosenCao"], "doi": "10.3390/s19020425\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2014.03.009\n10.1177/1475921710365419\n10.1016/j.cscm.2016.03.003\n10.1177/1475921718782399\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.02.011\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.07.029\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80bc\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80ef\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2851454\n10.3390/s17071641\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.11.050\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.04.002\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa891a\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa80c2\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.05.074\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.01.039\n10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2843788\n10.3390/s18072171\n10.1177/2280800017753051\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2014.12.007\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.01.041\n10.3390/ma11071223\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.09.015\n10.1155/2018/1953528\n10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000903\n10.1177/1045389X17689935\n10.1016/j.mechrescom.2017.08.011\n10.1177/1475921716670573\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa765e\n10.12989/sss.2015.15.4.997\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2728807\n10.1016/j.measurement.2017.10.025\n10.1109/JSEN.2017.2691540"}

It also exhibits a high acoustic sensitivity of 426 mV/MPa with a signal-to-noise ratio of 35 dB and a noise-equivalent pressure of 6.6 kPa (over 1\u207b50 MHz bandwidth) measured at 7-MHz frequency. The SPFS does not require multi-layer-coated structures that are used in other high-sensitivity optical detectors. Without any coating, this uses a microscale-roughened structure for evanescent-field interaction with an external medium acoustically modulated. Such unique structure allows significantly high sensitivity despite having a small detection area of only 0.016 mm\u00b2 as a narrow line sensor with a width of 8 \u03bcm. The SPFS performance is characterized in terms of acoustic frequency, amplitude responses, and sensitivities that are compared with those of a 1-mm diameter piezoelectric hydrophone used as a reference.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-24", "authors": ["JeongminHeo", "Kyu-TaeLee", "Ryun KyungKim", "Hyoung WonBaac"], "doi": "10.3390/s19020398\n10.1063/1.3589971\n10.1021/ph500159g\n10.1038/srep04496\n10.1364/OL.42.002655\n10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2496862\n10.1364/OL.37.001505\n10.1364/AO.47.000561\n10.1364/AO.46.003352\n10.1121/1.4921549\n10.1364/OE.21.006391\n10.1121/1.3117437\n10.1364/BOE.6.001502\n10.1364/OE.24.019008\n10.1038/s41598-017-01375-2\n10.1016/0041-624X(93)90020-Z\n10.1121/1.3625239\n10.1121/1.3583538\n10.1121/1.2166708\n10.1038/srep00989\n10.1063/1.4943369\n10.1364/AO.46.000800\n10.1016/j.snb.2016.02.020\n10.1016/S0925-4005(00)00718-8\n10.1016/j.optlaseng.2009.04.002\n10.1109/68.959366\n10.1364/AO.31.003438\n10.1063/1.3522833\n10.1039/C5NR03769G\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.3384\n10.1002/adom.201800491\n10.1364/OL.37.002046"}

First, the characterization of the PWAS materials shows that no significant change in the microstructure after exposure to high temperature and nuclear radiation, and the PWAS transducer can be used in harsh environments for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. Next, PWAS active sensing of various damage types in aluminum and composite structures are explored. PWAS transducers can successfully detect the simulated crack and corrosion damage in aluminum plates through the wavefield analysis, and the simulated delamination damage in composite plates through the damage imaging method. Finally, the novel use of PWAS transducers as acoustic emission (AE) sensors for in situ AE detection during fatigue crack growth is presented. The time of arrival of AE signals at multiple PWAS transducers confirms that the AE signals are originating from the crack, and that the amplitude decay due to geometric spreading is observed.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-24", "authors": ["HanfeiMei", "Mohammad FaisalHaider", "RoshanJoseph", "AsaadMigot", "VictorGiurgiutiu"], "doi": "10.3390/s19020383\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1928\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.01.020\n10.1088/0957-0233/19/12/122001\n10.1177/1475921710365419\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/053001\n10.3390/s140101208\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa785f\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.02.007\n10.1016/j.ultras.2014.10.024\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/3/035024\n10.3390/s150716536\n10.1016/j.ultras.2017.02.021\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa973e\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.005\n10.3390/s18072218\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.01.011\n10.1088/1361-665X/aa9bc2\n10.1177/1475921717707356\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085035\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/055048\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.09.021\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095021\n10.3390/s18072094\n10.3390/s18051521\n10.1016/j.ultras.2007.10.008\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.10.011\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/10/105002\n10.3390/ma9110916\n10.3390/s17122882\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055018\n10.1177/1045389X16666184\n10.1177/1475921718807310\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/020\n10.1177/1045389X15590269\n10.3390/s17050955\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/5/055007\n10.1177/1475921716674373\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/7/074002\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.02.001\n10.1177/1045389X14549873\n10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1692\n10.1007/s10921-013-0212-x\n10.1016/j.ultras.2016.04.020\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.008\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.097\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.09.034\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/6/014\n10.1016/j.ultras.2010.11.011\n10.1177/1045389X14521875\n10.1007/s12650-018-0497-z\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2011.04.011\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/2/025022\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2014.05.029\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/10/105022\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.02.014\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.12.015\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/10/105019\n10.1177/1045389X14557506\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.05.041\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.014\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.09.020\n10.1080/00150199008221486\n10.1080/00150198908217575\n10.1063/1.1325005\n10.1063/1.355874\n10.3390/inventions3030059\n10.1177/1045389X18818775\n10.1177/1475921718765955\n10.1121/1.4829534"}
{"title": "Side-Supported Radial-Mode Thin-Film Piezoelectric-on-Silicon Disk Resonators.", "abstract": "In this paper, anisotropy of single-crystalline silicon (SCS) is exploited to enable side-supported radial-mode thin-film piezoelectric-on-substrate (TPoS) disk resonators. In contrast to the case for isotropic material, it is demonstrated that the displacement of the disk periphery is not uniform for the radial-mode resonance in SCS disks. Specifically, for high-order harmonics, nodal points are formed on the edges, creating an opportunity for placing suspension tethers and enabling side-supported silicon disk resonators at the very high-frequency band with negligible anchor loss. In order to thoroughly study the effect of material properties and the tether location, anchor loss is simulated using a 3-D perfectly matched layer in COMSOL. Through modeling, it is shown that eighth-harmonic side-supported SCS disk resonators could potentially have orders of magnitude lower anchor loss in comparison to their nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) disk resonator counterparts given the tethers are aligned to the [100] crystalline plane of silicon. It is then experimentally demonstrated that in TPoS disk, resonators fabricated on an 8- [Formula: see text] silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, unloaded quality factor improves from ~450 for the second-harmonic mode at 43 MHz to ~11500 for the eighth-harmonic mode at 196 MHz if tethers are aligned to [100] plane. The same trend is not observed for NCD disk resonators and SCS disk resonators with tethers aligned to [110] plane. Finally, the temperature coefficient of frequency is simulated and measured for the radial-mode disk resonators fabricated on the 8- [Formula: see text]-thick degenerately n-type doped SCS, and the TFC data are utilized to guarantee proper identification of the harmonic radial-mode resonance peaks among others.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2019-01-23", "authors": ["SarahShahraini", "MohsenShahmohammadi", "HedyFatemi", "RezaAbdolvand"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2893121"}

However, whether salidroside plays a beneficial role in diabetic nephropathy is still unclear.\nThe objective of this work was to investigate the potential roles of salidroside against diabetic nephropathy and the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nStreptozocin was given to obese mice to generate diabetic nephropathy animal model. Salidroside was administered to these mice and proteinuria, podocyte integrity, renal morphology and fibrosis, mitochondrial biogenesis were examined.\nOur results showed that salidroside treatment greatly attenuates diabetic nephropathy as evidenced by decreased urinary albumin, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Morphological analysis indicated that salidroside improves renal structures in diabetic nephropathy. The decreases in nephrin and podocin expression were markedly reversed by salidroside. Moreover, kidney fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy mice was largely prevented by salidroside. Mechanistically, in salidroside-treated mice, the mitochondrial DNA copy and electron transport chain proteins were significantly enhanced. Meanwhile, the reduced Sirt1 and PGC-1\u03b1 expression in diabetic nephropathy was almost completely counteracted in the presence of salidroside.\nOur data showed that salidroside plays a beneficial role against diabetic nephropathy in mice, which probably via Sirt1/PGC-1\u03b1 mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2019-01-23", "authors": ["HaiyanXue", "PeipeiLi", "YishuLuo", "ChuwenWu", "YueLiu", "XiaogangQin", "XinzhongHuang", "ChengSun"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2018.10.031"}
{"title": "Microfiltration of raw soy sauce: membrane fouling mechanisms and characterization of physicochemical, aroma and shelf-life properties.", "abstract": "Refinement to remove fermented mash residue is essential for obtaining clarified, stable and high-quality soy sauce. In this study, raw soy sauce microfiltration was investigated. Four widely-used microfiltration membranes were employed: ceramic, polyethersulfone (PES), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and mixed cellulose ester (MCE). Membrane fouling mechanisms were identified based on the blocking filtration model, indicating that the dominant fouling mechanism during soy sauce microfiltration was cake formation on the membrane surface. Microfiltration delivered highly dispersed soy sauce having superior clarity and a light color, with satisfactory sterilization quality, and preserved well the NaCl, reducing sugar, total acid and amino nitrogen content, leading to a product having a longer shelf life as compared to pasteurization. The loss of volatile compounds after refinement (microfiltration and pasteurization) was not neglected, particularly the ester groups (total loss of 76.3% to 96.4%), which affected the aroma profile of the soy sauce; all the samples from microfiltration seemed to lack the floral aroma.

Twenty semen samples were used to determine toxicity level of nitric oxide by incubation of semen with different concentrations of nitric oxide (0.01 to 400 \u03bcM). Then, 26 semen samples were cryopreserved with optimized ranges of nitric oxide: control (NO-0.00), 0.01 \u03bcM nitric oxide (NO-0.01), 0.1 \u03bcM nitric oxide (NO-0.1), 1 \u03bcM nitric oxide (NO-1), 10 \u03bcM nitric oxide (NO-10), 100 \u03bcM nitric oxide (NO-100).

High-speed piezoelectric bimorph deformable Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors for rapid variation of the 2D size and shape of X-ray beams.", "abstract": "The tangential curvature of actively bent X-ray mirrors at synchrotron radiation and X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities is typically only changed every few hours or even days. This operation can take tens of minutes for active optics with multiple bending actuators and often requires expert guidance using in situ monitoring devices. Hence, the dynamic performance of active X-ray optics for synchrotron beamlines has historically not been exploited. This is in stark contrast to many other scientific fields. However, many areas of synchrotron radiation and XFEL science, including macromolecular crystallography, could greatly benefit from the ability to change the size and shape of the X-ray beam rapidly and continuously. The advantages of this innovative approach are twofold: a large reduction in the dead time required to change the size of the X-ray beam for different-sized samples and the possibility of making multiple changes to the beam during the measurement of a single sample. In the preceding paper [Part I; Alcock, Nistea, Signorato & Sawhney (2019), J.\u00a0Synchrotron Rad. 26, 36-44], which accompanies this article, high-speed visible-light Fizeau interferometry was used to identify the factors which influence the dynamic bending behaviour of piezoelectric bimorph deformable X-ray mirrors. Building upon this ex situ metrology study, provided here is the first synchrotron radiation beamline implementation of high-speed adaptive X-ray optics using two bimorphs operating as a Kirkpatrick-Baez pair. With optimized substrates, novel opto-mechanical holders and a next-generation high-voltage power supply, the size of an X-ray beam was rapidly and repeatedly switched in <10\u2005s. Of equal importance, it is also shown that compensation of piezoelectric creep ensures that the X-ray beam size remains stable for more than 1\u2005h after making a major change.

{"title": "Dynamic adaptive X-ray optics. Part I. Time-resolved optical metrology investigation of the bending behaviour of piezoelectric bimorph deformable X-ray mirrors.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric bimorph deformable mirrors (`bimorphs') are routinely used on many synchrotron and free-electron laser beamlines to provide active variation in the size and shape of the X-ray beam. However, the time-domain potential of such optics has never been fully exploited. For the first time, the fast dynamic bending response of bimorphs is investigated here using Fizeau interferometry. Automated scripts for acquisition and analysis were developed to collect Fizeau data at a rate of 0.1\u2005Hz to record dynamic changes in the optical surface as voltages were applied to the electrodes of the piezoelectric actuators. It is demonstrated that residual drift in the tangential radius of curvature of a bimorph can be significantly reduced using enhanced opto-mechanical holders and a fast programmable high-voltage power supply. Further improvements are achieved by applying small opposing voltages to compensate for piezoelectric creep. The present study shows that bimorphs can truly be used as high-speed adaptive optics for the X-ray domain, even without closed-loop feedback correction. This opens the possibility for relatively simple real-time tuning of the profile of X-ray bimorphs. Part II of this study [Alcock, Nistea, Signorato, Owen, Axford, Sutter, Foster & Sawhney (2019), J.

{"title": "Predictive Modeling of Machining Temperatures with Force\u207bTemperature Correlation Using Cutting Mechanics and Constitutive Relation.", "abstract": "Elevated temperature in the machining process is detrimental to cutting tools-a result of the effect of thermal softening and material diffusion. Material diffusion also deteriorates the quality of the machined part. Measuring or predicting machining temperatures is important for the optimization of the machining process, but experimental temperature measurement is difficult and inconvenient because of the complex contact phenomena between tools and workpieces, and because of restricted accessibility during the machining process. This paper presents an original analytical model for fast prediction of machining temperatures at two deformation zones in orthogonal cutting, namely the primary shear zone and the tool\u207bchip interface. Temperatures were predicted based on a correlation between force and temperature using the mechanics of the cutting process and material constitutive relation. Minimization of the differences between calculated material flow stresses using a mechanics model and a constitutive model yielded an estimate of machining temperatures. Experimental forces, cutting condition parameters, and constitutive model constants were inputs, while machining forces were easily measurable by a piezoelectric dynamometer. Machining temperatures of AISI 1045 steel were predicted under various cutting conditions to demonstrate the predictive capability of each presented model. Close agreements were observed by verifying them against documented values in the literature. The influence of model inputs and computational efficiency were further investigated.

{"title": "In-situ dissolution and permeation studies of nanocrystal formulations with second-derivative UV spectroscopy.", "abstract": "One of the most difficult challenges in developing nanocrystal formulations is to determine the dissolution behavior of nanocrystal suspensions (nanosuspensions), which occurs within seconds. Mefenamic acid (MFA) is a poorly soluble drug thought to limit the dissolution rate for membrane permeation. In this study, in-situ dissolution-permeation studies of a nanosuspension of mefenamic acid (MFA) were carried out using second-derivative UV spectroscopy. This method enabled us to distinguish between the concentrations of dissolved MFA and nano-suspended MFA via in-situ measurement and showed an improved dissolution rate of the nanosuspension compared to that of the microsuspension. The dissolution-permeation study with second-derivative UV spectroscopy revealed that the improved dissolution rate due to nanosized MFA resulted in an increase in the permeated amount of MFA. In addition, the solubility of MFA determined by HPLC after filtration with a 0.02-\u03bcm filter indicated that enhanced solubility due to nanosizing also improves the permeability of MFA. Therefore, we concluded that the solubility and dissolution rate enhancements attained by nanosizing would be key factors in increasing membrane transportation of MFA. These novel in-situ dissolution-permeation studies using second-derivative UV spectroscopy offer considerable promise for developing and characterizing nanocrystal formulations.", "journal": "International journal of pharmaceutics", "date": "2019-01-18", "authors": ["MasaakiImono", "HiromasaUchiyama", "HiroshiUeda", "KazunoriKadota", "YuichiTozuka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.12.086"}

Such electrical charges could facilitate electron movement from one molecule to another triggering therefore chemical reactions.

However, unwanted heat dissipation needs to be reduced by using large cooling fans and heat pipe structures. To reduce unwanted heat, class-B power amplifiers may be a possible solution. However, the non-linearity of class-B power amplifiers could limit their integration with piezoelectric transducers because non-linearity in the high-voltage output of the power amplifiers deteriorates the sensitivity of portable ultrasound systems. To improve the linearity of the power amplifier, we developed prelinearized class-B power amplifiers for piezoelectric transducers and portable ultrasound systems.

{"title": "GsMTx4 reduces the reflex pressor response during dynamic hindlimb skeletal muscle stretch in decerebrate rats.", "abstract": "Mechanical signals within contracting skeletal muscles contribute to the generation of the exercise pressor reflex; an important autonomic and cardiovascular control mechanism. In decerebrate rats, the mechanically activated channel inhibitor GsMTx4 was found to reduce the pressor response during static hindlimb muscle stretch; a maneuver used to investigate specifically the mechanical component of the exercise pressor reflex (i.e., the mechanoreflex). However, the effect was found only during the initial phase of the stretch when muscle length was changing and not during the later phase of stretch when muscle length was relatively constant. We tested the hypothesis that in decerebrate, unanesthetized rats, GsMTx4 would reduce the pressor response throughout the duration of a 30\u00a0sec, 1\u00a0Hz dynamic hindlimb muscle stretch protocol that produced repetitive changes in muscle length. We found that the injection of 10\u00a0\u03bcg of GsMTx4 into the arterial supply of a hindlimb reduced the peak pressor response (control: 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04, GsMTx4: 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mmHg, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, n\u00a0=\u00a08) and the pressor response at multiple time points throughout the duration of the stretch. GsMTx4 had no effect on the pressor response to the hindlimb arterial injection of lactic acid which indicates the lack of local off-target effects. Combined with the recent finding that GsMTx4 reduced the pressor response only initially during static stretch in decerebrate rats, the present findings suggest that GsMTx4-sensitive channels respond primarily to mechanical signals associated with changes in muscle length. The findings add to our currently limited understanding of the channels that contribute to the activation of the mechanoreflex.", "journal": "Physiological reports", "date": "2019-01-12", "authors": ["Bailey CSanderson", "Korynne SRollins", "Tyler DHopkins", "Alec LButenas", "Kennedy PFelice", "Carl JAde", "Steven WCopp"], "doi": "10.14814/phy2.13974"}
{"title": "Comparison of Piezoelectric and Optical Projection Imaging for Three-Dimensional In Vivo Photoacoustic Tomography.", "abstract": "Ultrasound sensor arrays for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) are investigated that create line projections of the pressure generated in an object by pulsed light illumination. Projections over a range of viewing angles enable the reconstruction of a three-dimensional image. Two line-integrating arrays are compared in this study for the in vivo imaging of vasculature, a piezoelectric array, and a camera-based setup that captures snapshots of the acoustic field emanating from the sample. An array consisting of 64 line-shaped sensors made of piezoelectric polymer film, which was arranged on a half-cylindrical area, was used to acquire spatiotemporal data from a human finger. The optical setup used phase contrast to visualize the acoustic field generated in the leg of a mouse after a selected delay time. Time-domain back projection and frequency-domain back propagation were used for image reconstruction from the piezoelectric and optical data, respectively. The comparison yielded an about threefold higher resolution for the optical setup and an about 13-fold higher sensitivity of the piezoelectric array. Due to the high density of data in the camera images, the optical technique gave images without streak artifacts, which were visible in the piezo array images due to the discrete detector positions. Overall, both detection concepts are suited for almost real-time projection imaging and three-dimensional imaging with a data acquisition time of less than a minute without averaging, which was limited by the repetition rate of the laser.", "journal": "Journal of imaging", "date": "2019-01-11", "authors": ["RobertNuster", "G\u00fcntherPaltauf"], "doi": "10.3390/jimaging5010015\n10.1088/0031-9155/54/4/014\n10.1364/AO.46.003352\n10.1038/lsa.2016.201\n10.1364/OL.35.002475\n10.1038/s41467-018-04576-z\n10.1117/1.3259361\n10.1109/TMI.2004.843199\n10.1088/0266-5611/23/6/S07\n10.1002/jbio.201100110\n10.1016/j.pacs.2017.09.002\n10.1364/BOE.8.003938\n10.1364/OE.18.006288\n10.1364/BOE.5.002635\n10.1063/1.1829775\n10.1016/j.pacs.2016.02.001\n10.1364/AO.40.003800\n10.1109/TBME.2016.2605451\n10.1038/s41377-018-0036-7\n10.1109/58.818769\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.059903\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.046706\n10.1088/0031-9155/46/7/309\n10.1088/0031-9155/54/11/002\n10.1117/1.JBO.19.5.056011\n10.1103/PhysRevE.67.056605\n10.1088/0266-5611/26/12/125002\n10.1118/1.1644531"}
{"title": "A hydrophobic gate in the inner pore helix is the major determinant of inactivation in mechanosensitive Piezo channels.", "abstract": "Piezo1 and Piezo2 belong to a family of mechanically-activated ion channels implicated in a wide range of physiological processes. Mechanical stimulation triggers Piezo channels to open, but their characteristic fast inactivation process results in rapid closure. Several disease-causing mutations in Piezo1 alter the rate of inactivation, highlighting the importance of inactivation to the normal function of this channel. However, despite the structural identification of two physical constrictions within the closed pore, the mechanism of inactivation remains unknown. Here we identify a functionally conserved inactivation gate in the pore-lining inner helix of mouse Piezo1 and Piezo2 that is distinct from the two constrictions. We show that this gate controls the majority of Piezo1 inactivation via a hydrophobic mechanism and that one of the physical constrictions acts as a secondary gate. Our results suggest that, unlike other rapidly inactivating ion channels, a hydrophobic barrier gives rise to fast inactivation in Piezo channels.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2019-01-11", "authors": ["WangZheng", "Elena OGracheva", "Sviatoslav NBagriantsev"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.44003\n10.1002/ajmg.a.37997\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2017.01.001\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2016.11.002\n10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.094\n10.1182/blood-2013-02-482489\n10.1016/j.jmb.2014.07.030\n10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01151-7\n10.1073/pnas.1136844100\n10.1073/pnas.1412740111\n10.7554/eLife.07370\n10.1126/science.aat4346\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.7554/eLife.33149\n10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.039\n10.1111/bph.14188\n10.1038/ncomms9085\n10.1182/blood-2017-05-786004\n10.4161/chan.21064\n10.1038/nature21407\n10.7554/eLife.33660\n10.1038/jhg.2016.153\n10.7554/eLife.41968\n10.1038/35102535\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.026\n10.1038/nn.4394\n10.1038/s41467-018-04405-3\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.05.079\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.1038/ncomms9329\n10.1038/nature13250\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040346\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.015\n10.1073/pnas.91.25.12346\n10.1038/s41467-018-03502-7\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9897\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1073/pnas.1409802111\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1038/nature13980\n10.1016/j.neuron.2015.08.032\n10.1039/C8FD00013A\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.072\n10.1038/s41467-017-00429-3\n10.1038/nsmb.1633\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1073/pnas.1413656111\n10.1073/pnas.1708793114\n10.1126/science.aal4326\n10.7554/eLife.07369\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.035\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9892\n10.1172/JCI87343\n10.1038/s41467-018-03570-9\n10.1073/pnas.89.22.10910\n10.1038/nature13251\n10.1038/nn.4162\n10.1038/ncomms12939\n10.1016/j.tibs.2016.09.004\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.120\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.039\n10.1038/nature25782\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253\n10.1126/science.aau6324\n10.1038/nature25743\n10.1096/fj.201700599RR\n10.1038/s41467-018-04586-x"}
{"title": "Use of a right ventricular continuous flow pump to validate the distensible model of the pulmonary vasculature.", "abstract": "In the pulmonary circulation, resistive and compliant properties overlap in the same vessels. Resistance varies nonlinearly with pressure and flow; this relationship is driven by the elastic properties of the vessels. Linehan et al. correlated the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and mean flow with resistance using an original equation incorporating the distensibility of the pulmonary arteries. The goal of this study was to validate this equation in an in vivo porcine model. In vivo measurements were acquired in 6 pigs. The distensibility coefficient (DC) was measured by placing piezo-electric crystals around the pulmonary artery (PA). In addition to experiments under pulsatile conditions, a right ventricular (RV) bypass system was used to induce a continuous pulmonary flow state. The Linehan et al. equation was then used to predict the pressure from the flow under continuous flow conditions. The diameter-derived DC was 2.4%/mmHg (+/-0.4%), whereas the surface area-based DC was 4.1 %/mmHg (+/-0.1%). An increase in continuous flow was associated with a constant decrease in resistance, which correlated with the diameter-based DC (r=-0.8407, p=0.044) and the surface area-based DC (r=-0.8986, p=0.028). In contrast to the Linehan et al. equation, our results showed constant or even decreasing pressure as flow increased. Using a model of continuous pulmonary flow induced by an RV assist system, pulmonary pressure could not be predicted based on the flow using the Linehan et al. equation. Measurements of distensibility based on the diameter of the PA were inversely correlated with the resistance.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2019-01-11", "authors": ["FVanden Eynden", "PSegers", "TBov\u00e9", "FDe Somer", "BEl Oumeiri", "GVan Nooten"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.933894"}

{"title": "Resolution Limits in Photoacoustic Imaging Caused by Acoustic Attenuation.", "abstract": "In conventional photoacoustic tomography, several effects contribute to the loss of resolution, such as the limited bandwidth and the finite size of the transducer, or the space-dependent speed of sound. They can all be compensated (in principle) technically or numerically. Frequency-dependent acoustic attenuation also limits spatial resolution by reducing the bandwidth of the photoacoustic signal, which can be numerically compensated only up to a theoretical limit given by thermodynamics. The entropy production, which is the dissipated energy of the acoustic wave divided by the temperature, turns out to be equal to the information loss, which cannot be compensated for by any reconstruction method. This is demonstrated for the propagation of planar acoustic waves in water, which are induced by short laser pulses and measured by piezoelectric acoustical transducers. It turns out that for water, where the acoustic attenuation is proportional to the squared frequency, the resolution limit is proportional to the square root of the distance and inversely proportional to the square root of the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed method could be used in future work for media other than water, such as biological tissue, where acoustic attenuation has a different power-law frequency dependence.", "journal": "Journal of imaging", "date": "2019-01-10", "authors": ["PeterBurgholzer", "JohannesBauer-Marschallinger", "BernhardReitinger", "ThomasBerer"], "doi": "10.3390/jimaging5010013\n10.1162/153535003322331993\n10.1098/rsfs.2011.0028\n10.1126/science.1216210\n10.1103/PhysRevE.75.046706\n10.1017/S0956792508007353\n10.1364/OPTICA.4.000017\n10.1364/OE.25.004875\n10.1364/OL.31.000781\n10.1088/0031-9155/56/18/021\n10.1088/0266-5611/26/11/115003\n10.1121/1.3377056\n10.1117/1.JBO.18.3.036008\n10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2504\n10.1121/1.3699194\n10.1007/s10765-015-1890-7\n10.3390/bioengineering5030070\n10.1209/0295-5075/95/40004\n10.1063/1.4978010"}

{"title": "Evaluation of a Piezo-Actuated Sensor for Monitoring Elastic Variations of Its Support with Impedance-Based Measurements.", "abstract": "This study exposes the assessment of a piezo-actuated sensor for monitoring elastic variations (change in Young's modulus) of a host structure in which it is attached. The host structure is monitored through a coupling interface connected to the piezo-actuated device. Two coupling interfaces were considered (an aluminum cone and a human tooth) for the experimental tests. Three different materials (aluminum, bronze and steel) were prepared to emulate the elastic changes in the support, keeping the geometry as a fixed parameter. The piezo device was characterized from velocity frequency response functions in pursuance to understand how vibration modes stimulate the electrical resistance through electrical resonance peaks of the sensor. An impedance-based analysis (1\u207b20 kHz) was performed to correlate elastic variations with indexes based on root mean square deviation (RMSD) for two observation windows (9.3 to 9.7 kHz and 11.1 to 11.5 kHz). Results show that imposed elastic variations were detected and quantified with the electrical resistance measurements. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the device was influenced by the type of coupling interface since the cone was more sensitive than the tooth in both observation windows. As a final consideration, results suggest that bio-structures (fruits and bone, among others) could be studied since these can modify naturally its elastic properties.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-10", "authors": ["Hector ATinoco", "Carlos ICardona", "Fabio MPe\u00f1a", "Juan PGomez", "Samuel IRoldan-Restrepo", "Maria AVelasco-Mejia", "Daniel RBarco"], "doi": "10.3390/s19010184\n10.1007/s13349-015-0108-9\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.085\n10.3390/s17112467\n10.3390/s17020250\n10.3390/s18051307\n10.1016/j.compag.2014.06.011\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.05.018\n10.1111/ele.13103\n10.1098/rsta.2006.1934\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/035008\n10.1177/1045389X09352816\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2007.00397.x\n10.1007/s11012-013-9740-9\n10.1007/s00198-004-1702-6\n10.1177/1045389X16672570\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2018.09.016\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/11/115022\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.05.020\n10.1177/1045389X14554129\n10.1016/j.fdj.2017.03.001\n10.1155/2014/784731\n10.3390/s18092766\n10.1177/1045389X13481254\n10.1088/0964-1726/26/1/015003\n10.1106/8BFB-GC8P-XQ47-YCQ0\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.08.011\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065038\n10.1007/s10921-015-0299-3\n10.1177/1045389X9700800406\n10.1177/1475921705049752\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.02.014\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.11.031\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/6/025\n10.1177/1475921717715240\n10.1016/S0736-0266(01)00012-2\n10.1016/S0020-1383(16)47003-8\n10.3390/vibration1010015\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/054002\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000006\n10.1002/cnm.2917"}

We have first optimized the best concentration for ZnO/PDMS nanocomposite for the realization of the piezoelectric nanogenerator. Later, with the same configuration, we implemented a novel, simple, facile, frugal, and inexpensive technique to fabricate ZCH. The heterojunction results in the improved charge transfer characteristics, low capacitance, and charge nullification contributing to the enhanced piezoelectric output. This reflects in the improvement of the peak-to-peak piezoelectric potential of the device from 2.7 to 9 V.

{"title": "Reversibility of membrane performance and structure changes caused by extreme cold water temperature and elevated conditioning water temperature.", "abstract": "The effects of extreme cold water temperature, elevated cleaning water temperature, cleaning time on membrane performance, and pore size distribution were studied using flat-sheet polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Extreme cold water temperature led to a decrease in membrane permeability, and membrane pore size shrinkage. The use of periodical warm water (35\u202f\u00b0C) membrane conditioning could almost completely recover the membrane permeability and pore size structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature, while the use of room temperature (23\u00b11\u202f\u00b0C) conditioning recovered majority of the membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature. Changes in membrane performance correlate well with changes in membrane structure. Membranes periodically conditioned in warmer water temperature showed a higher permeability than that periodically conditioned at room temperature from a long-term operation of three months. The results suggest the change in PVDF membrane performance and structure caused by extreme cold water temperature is almost completely reversible after periodical warm water conditioning, and thus the use of warm water conditioning and/or chemical cleaning will benefit the recovery of membrane performance and structure change caused by extreme cold water temperature in cold regions.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2019-01-07", "authors": ["AdriannaTikka", "WaGao", "BaoqiangLiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.047"}

Both transducers integrated most of previous researches while one transducer has a multilayer cavity structure which is different from the other structure and previous transducer structures. After a detailed simulation analysis of every structural parameter, key parameters were pointed out to have an obvious influence on its performance. Then, two models were constructed and compared with chosen sets of geometry parameters and manufacturing process, which can also provide a reference for low-frequency transducer design. The simulation results and experimental results of our transducers show a good consistency which indicates the cavity structure can reduce the resonance frequency.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2019-01-06", "authors": ["WenjieWang", "WeihaoShi", "PeterThomas", "MingsuiYang"], "doi": "10.3390/s19010137\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.07.005\n10.1016/j.proeng.2010.09.057\n10.1007/s00348-006-0135-8\n10.1016/j.sna.2017.05.044\n10.1016/S0301-5629(03)00908-6\n10.1016/S0301-5629(02)00706-8\n10.1111/j.2042-7158.1991.tb06681.x\n10.1007/s11095-007-9306-4\n10.1109/TIM.2012.2188350\n10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2836311\n10.1080/00150199408222471\n10.1109/58.658312\n10.1109/58.726463\n10.1088/0964-1726/2/4/001\n10.1109/58.108862\n10.1109/JOE.2004.837141\n10.1007/s100190050094\n10.1016/S0041-624X(00)00055-X\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.06.022\n10.1016/j.sna.2005.08.028\n10.1115/SMASIS2011-5005"}

In this work, PVDF/GO/ZnO composite membranes with photocatalytic performance for organic dyes were prepared by using zinc oxide (ZnO) as photo-catalyst, graphene (GO) as dispersant and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane as carrier. The effect ZnO and GO on the structure, surface composition and photocatalytic activity of PVDF/GO/ZnO composite membranes were investigated. Owing to the strong hydrophilicity of the carboxyl group, the addition of GO enhanced the dispersibility of ZnO in PVDF membranes, which was proved by SEM results. Under Xenon irradiation (300\u202fW), the photocatalytic degradation rate of PVDF/GO/ZnO composite membranes for methylene blue (MB) could reach 86.84%.

Efforts have been ongoing for improving the output power of nanogenerators by maximizing their surface charge density via surface modification or structure optimization. Nevertheless, because of inevitable air breakdown during the operation process, enhancing charge density is not retainable, which is the most crucial limitation for the output performance of nanogenerators. Here, a suppressing breakdown strategy is developed to remarkably enhance the output charge density of the nanogenerator by embedding a dielectric film (polyvinylidene fluoride) with high permittivity into air gaps.

{"title": "Mapping intrinsic electromechanical responses at the nanoscale via sequential excitation scanning probe microscopy empowered by deep data.", "abstract": "Ever-increasing hardware capabilities and computation powers have enabled acquisition and analysis of big scientific data at the nanoscale routine, though much of the data acquired often turn out to be redundant, noisy and/or irrelevant to the problems of interest, and it remains nontrivial to draw clear mechanistic insights from pure data analytics. In this work, we use scanning probe microscopy (SPM) as an example to demonstrate deep data methodology for nanosciences, transitioning from brute-force analytics such as data mining, correlation analysis and unsupervised classification to informed and/or targeted causative data analytics built on sound physical understanding. Three key ingredients of such deep data analytics are presented. A sequential excitation scanning probe microscopy (SE-SPM) technique is first developed to acquire high-quality, efficient and physically relevant data, which can be easily implemented on any standard atomic force microscope (AFM). Brute-force physical analysis is then carried out using a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) model, enabling us to derive intrinsic electromechanical coupling of interest. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) is carried out, which not only speeds up the analysis by four orders of magnitude, but also allows a clear physical interpretation of its modes in combination with SHO analysis. A rough piezoelectric material has been probed using such a strategy, enabling us to map its intrinsic electromechanical properties at the nanoscale with high fidelity, where conventional methods fail. The SE in combination with deep data methodology can be easily adapted for other SPM techniques to probe a wide range of functional phenomena at the nanoscale.", "journal": "National science review", "date": "2019-01-01", "authors": ["BoyuanHuang", "Ehsan NasrEsfahani", "JiangyuLi"], "doi": "10.1093/nsr/nwy096"}

{"title": "Fabrication and selection of surrogate knee implant bearings for experimental evaluation of embedded in-vivo sensors.", "abstract": "Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is a common procedure that is gaining importance with the aging American population. Although TKR is common, about 20% of patients report being unhappy with their results. Previous research has pointed to misalignment and loosening as contributing factors to negative outcomes. What is lacking in the field of TKR is a sensory system that can determine the internal loads of the knee in a direct manner. Implant bearings embedded with piezoelectric transducers have already shown promise in providing accurate sensing data. To perform further experimentation, prototype implant bearings that can be accurately and efficiently produced are needed. This work investigates various fabrication processes and possible materials to provide a foundation for developing surrogate biomechanical implants, especially those with integrated smart sensors. In this study, an original knee bearing is scanned and the resulting geometries used to generate prototypes. The prototypes are fabricated using a variety of methods including CNC machining and additive manufacturing. The prototypes are then tested to determine load distribution, active sensor performance, as well as kinematic performance under loading. The results of this study show that FDM printing provides quick and affordable results but is not ideal for rigorous experimentation. SLA printed prototypes are improved in final quality with an increase in fabrication time. Lastly, CNC machined processes are more labor intensive but can provide the best material characteristics.

The damaged muscular tissues are replaced by scar tissues and burdens the healthy muscles resulting in further attenuated functioning of heart. Since, human heart muscles cannot regenerate naturally or it has been thought so, pharmacological procedures such as using a heart assist device are followed to restore the lost function of heart. Stem cell engineering and cardiac patches offers promising prospects with their cutting edge research reports. Cardiac patches offers a viable solution as they can also function as an implant to assist in offering the mechanical support the damaged muscles were capable of. Designing cardiac patches to suit multiple functions is not only challenging but also perilous due to the target organ with which it will be interfaced. Sensor based, electrically active, miniaturized circuitry etc., poses a huge threat to the individual in whom the device/patch is implanted.

Hence, in this article, the vibration motion of a piezoelectric rectangular cross-section micro-cantilever (MC) which oscillates in the moist environment has been examined based on the Timoshenko beam theory. After extracting the MC governing equations according to Hamilton's principle, the finite element method has been used to discretize the motion equations. The surface topography has been simulated for various roughness forms in the tapping and non-contact modes by considering the effects of the Van der Waals, capillary and contact forces. Also, the experimental results obtained from the glass surface topography have been simulated. The results illustrate that the time delay in higher natural frequencies in the tapping mode is shorter in comparison with the non-contact mode, especially, for the lower natural frequencies. The sensitivity analysis of the natural frequencies, topography depth and time delay have been simulated. Results indicate that the most effective parameter is the MC length.

Herein, a zwitterionic nanohydrogel-grafted\u00a0\u00a0PVDF (ZNG- g-PVDF) nanofibrous membrane was fabricated via a simple surface activation and amide reaction. By tailoring the parameters for electrospinning, PAA-g-PVDF nanofibrous membranes with interpenetrated nanofibers and microsphere structure were formed, and the membrane surface was endowed with high roughness on the micrometer scale. Combined with the strong hydration ability of the grafted zwitterionic nanohydrogels, the obtained ZNG- g-PVDF nanofibrous membrane exhibited a superhydrophilic property and nearly zero adhesion to crude oil under water. It thus showed an extremely high removal efficiency (\u223c98.7%) for gravity-driven separation of the crude oil-in-water emulsion. Both the water-permeating flux and oil content in the collected filtrate (lower than 13 ppm) showed little change during 10 cycles of the filtration experiment, indicating superior crude oil foulant repellency performance of the ZNG- g-PVDF nanofibrous membrane.

Here, a promising electro-assisted bioprinting method is developed, which can print low-concentration pure GelMA microdroplets with low cost, low cell damage, and high efficiency. With the help of electrostatic attraction, uniform GelMA microdroplets measuring about 100 \u03bcm are rapidly printed. Due to the application of lower external forces to separate the droplets, cell damage during printing is negligible, which often happens in piezoelectric or thermal inkjet bioprinting. Different printing states and effects of printing parameters (voltages, gas pressure, nozzle size, etc.) on microdroplet diameter are also investigated. The fundamental properties of low-concentration GelMA microspheres are subsequently studied. The results show that the printed microspheres with 5% w/v GelMA can provide a suitable microenvironment for laden bone marrow stem cells.

In the acoustic FFF channel used in the device, ultrasound waves generated from piezoelectric transducers driven by a sinusoidal signal of 2.02\u202fMhz propagated into the carrier liquid flow and built up a quarter-wavelength ultrasound standing wave field across the channel height. It was experimentally demonstrated that the acoustic field with a pressure node plane at the bottom surface of the channel reduced the thickness of the particle diffusion layer in a stagnant liquid proportional to the applied voltage driving the piezoelectric transducer. In the size-dependent particle separation, the particle mixture flowing through the acoustic FFF channel experienced an acoustic radiation force in the gravitational direction. As a result, suppressing the diffusion of small particles, particles were transported along the bottom surface of the channel with the local velocity of the carrier liquid at the particle center.

The band structure calculations show that the 2D Janus Te2Se monolayer is an indirect gap semiconductor, and the intrinsic mirror asymmetry combined with the spin-orbit coupling induces the Rashba spin splitting and the out-of-plane spin polarization. Moreover, the absence of both the inversion symmetry and out-of-plane mirror symmetry, together with flexible mechanical properties, results in large in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients that are valuable in 2D piezoelectric materials. Furthermore, the out-of-plane piezoelectric effects can exist in multilayer structures under different stacking sequences while the in-plane piezoelectric effect can only exist in some specific stacking patterns. The piezoelectric coefficients of the Janus Te2Se monolayer and multilayers exceed those of many Janus transition metal dichalcogenides and other well-known piezoelectric materials (e.g., \u03b1-quartz and wurtzite-AlN).

It is assumed that the media are loosely bonded to each other and are under horizontal initial stresses. It is established that the boundary conditions are satisfied by the set of three coupled waves associated with the PFRC medium (namely quasi-longitudinal wave (qP), quasi-transverse wave (qSV), electrostatic wave (EA)) and two coupled waves associated with the FRC medium (namely quasi-longitudinal wave (qP), quasi-transverse wave (qSV)). The amplitude ratio of reflected and refracted waves are obtained with the aid of suitable boundary conditions at the common interface of the two media. The effect of anisotropy, initial stresses and loose bonding on the amplitude ratio are studied numerically and demonstrated by means of graphs.

{"title": "Genetically Induced In Situ-Poling for Piezo-Active Biohybrid Nanowires.", "abstract": "Polycrystalline piezo-active materials only exhibit a high macroscopic piezoresponse if they consist of particles with oriented crystal directions and aligned intrinsic dipole moments. For ferroelectric materials, the postsynthesis alignment of the dipoles is generally achieved by electric poling procedures. However, there are numerous technically interesting non-ferroelectric piezo-active materials like zinc oxide (ZnO). These materials demand the alignment of their intrinsic dipoles during the fabrication process. Therefore, in situ-poling techniques have to be developed. This study utilizes genetically modified M13 phage templates for the generation of force fields, which directly control the ZnO dipole poling. By genetic modification of M13 phage template, the piezoelectric response of the ZnO/M13 phage hybrid nanowire is doubled compared to the hybrid nanowire based on unmodified M13 wild type (wt) phage templates. Thus, the formation of piezo-active domains consisting of oriented ZnO nanocrystals is directly induced by the genetic modification. By the combination of the fiber-like structure of individual M13 phages with the bioenhanced electromechanical properties of ZnO, hybrid nanowires with a length of \u22481.1 \u00b5m and a thickness of \u224863.5 nm are fabricated with a high piezoelectric coefficient of up to d", "journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "date": "2018-12-15", "authors": ["StefanKilper", "TimotheusJahnke", "MarcAulich", "ZaklinaBurghard", "DirkRothenstein", "JoachimBill"], "doi": "10.1002/adma.201805597"}

However, they face a problem that only metastable or unstable structures are noncentrosymmetric with piezoelectricity, thus leading to the difficulty in experimental observation. Motivated by the recent advances in the synthesis of 2D group III nitrides, in this paper, for the first time, we study the piezoelectric properties of the 2D group III nitrides (XN, X = Al, Ga, and In) with buckled hexagonal configurations by surface passivation, which are thermodynamically stable. Unlike the previously reported planar graphitic structure, we demonstrate that the hydrogenated 2D nitrides (H-XN-H, X = Al, Ga, and In) exhibit both the in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric effects in their monolayer and multilayer structures under an external strain in the basal plane. We further elucidate the underlying mechanism of the piezoelectricity by analyzing the correlations between the piezoelectric coefficients and their structural, electronic, and chemical properties. In addition, we show that H-F cofunctionalization not only enhances the stability, but also significantly improves the ionic polarization because of the charge redistribution, thus leading to large in-plane piezoelectric coefficients in F-XN-H. Our study advances the research in 2D piezoelectric materials and would stimulate more theoretical and experimental efforts in developing effective piezoelectric materials for device applications.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2018-12-15", "authors": ["YaguangGuo", "HuaiqiuZhu", "QianWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b17341"}

Skin-interfaced platforms of this type have broad utility in continuous clinical-grade monitoring of physiological status, with the potential to significantly lower the cost and increase the efficacy of modern health care. Development of materials and device designs for power supply systems in this context is critically important, and it represents a rapidly expanding focus of research in the chemical sciences. Reformulating conventional technologies into biocompatible platforms and co-integrating them into skin-interfaced systems demand innovative approaches in materials chemistry and engineering. In terms of physical properties, the resulting devices must offer levels of flexibility, stretchability, thickness, and mass density that approach those of the epidermis itself, while maintaining operational characteristics and mechanical durability for practical use outside of a laboratory or hospital. While nearly all commercially available components for energy storage and harvesting are rigid and planar, recent research provides options in devices that are biocompatible not only at the level of the constituent materials but also in terms of the mechanics and geometrical forms, with resulting capabilities for establishing stable, nonirritating, intimate interfaces to the skin for extended periods of time. This Account highlights the range of materials choices and associated device architectures for skin-interfaced power supply systems. The Account begins with an overview of the main design strategies, ranging from one-, two-, and three-dimensional engineered composite structures to active materials that are intrinsically stretchable. The following sections describe a broad collection of devices based on these concepts, starting with batteries and supercapacitors for storage and then photovoltaic, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric devices for harvesting. Representative examples highlight recent advances, with a focus on the relationship between the materials and the performance during deformation. A final section discusses the challenges and opportunities in this area. Continued efforts in fundamental chemical research will be critically important to progress in this emerging field of technology. For example, understanding the mechanisms by which physical deformations affect the intrinsic materials properties and the system-level performance requires further study. The development of stretchable and biocompatible solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity is an example of a specific area of interest for energy storage devices. Here and in other storage and harvesting systems advanced materials are needed to provide robust barriers to environmental factors.

Such nonlinear vibrations have been studied by some researchers; however, the related increase in temperature has not been taken into consideration, because it is a complicated phenomenon. In this study, the mechanism underlying the interaction between nonlinear vibration and temperature increase in a piezoelectric transducer under high-power conditions was clarified. For this purpose, cubic terms of the mechanical strain, the nonlinear transfer matrix method, and the heat conduction equation were combined. Additionally, it is necessary to utilize the distributed parameter model because the temperature increase is not uniform.

With the aim of improving detection performances, we venture beyond hotspot engineering in this tutorial review and focus on emerging material design strategies to capture and confine analytes near SERS-active surfaces as well as various promising hybrid SERS platforms. We outline five major approaches to enhance SERS performance: (1) enlarging Raman scattering cross-sections of non-resonant molecules via chemical coupling reactions; (2) targeted chemical capturing of analytes through surface-grafted agents to localize them on plasmonic surfaces; (3) physically confining liquid analytes on non-wetting SERS-active surfaces and (4) confining gaseous analytes using porous materials over SERS hotspots; (5) synergizing conventional metal-based SERS platforms with functional materials such as graphene, semiconducting materials, and piezoelectric polymers. These approaches can be integrated with engineered hotspots as a multifaceted strategy to further boost SERS sensitivities that are unachievable using hotspot engineering alone.

Piezoelectric energy harvesting is one of the promising renewable energy sources. As the use portable electronic devices increases, the need for portable renewable energy sources further increases. Especially, piezoelectric materials can be the best selection due to their robust properties. In this research, piezoelectric composites were prepared and investigated for piezoelectric energy harvesting applications. In this study, two types of flexible energy harvesters, 0.36BS-0.64PT-PVDF composite and PVDF film, were prepared and analyzed. Due to its high Curie temperature and low lead content, BS-PT is expected to be a substitute for PZT in the near future. The composite materials based on the PVDF and 0.36BS-0.64PT film showed higher open circuit voltage (0.73 V) than PVDF film (0.49 V). Also, the stored voltage of 0.36BS-0.64PT-PVDF composite film was 330 nJ which is 5.68 times higher than 58 nJ for PVDF films. By introducing the piezoelectric BS-PT ceramics, 0.36BS-0.64PT-PVDF composite film shows the enhanced performance such as open circuit voltage, energy and dielectric constant compared with those of PVDF materials.

However, little is known about the influence of geometry of sutures on biocompatibility. To elucidate this factor we focused on geometry-modification resulting in ultrafine polyethylene terephthalate (UFPET) suture and a snowflake like shaped polyvenylidenfluorid (PVDF) suture. Forty-eight rats were divided into two observation periods. In each rat 3 out of 4 sutures (profiled UFPET, snowflake-like profiled PVDF, reference Prolene and Mersilene suture) were randomly placed into the subcutaneous tissue. Rats were euthanized after 7 and 21 days and samples were explanted. Foreign body granuloma was measured and expression of CD68, TUNEL, Ki-67 and Collagen I/III ratio were determined. The profiled (snowflake) suture showed a significantly smaller FBG in comparison to standard sutures (p < 0.001). Both modified sutures showed a significant lower tissue remodeling by Ki-67 and TUNEL expression (p < 0.03). Furthermore, profiled sutures caused a lower inflammatory reaction expressed in a significant lower amount of CD68 positive macrophages after 21 days (p < 0.001). Modifications of suture geometry alter the foreign body granuloma and the inflammatory reaction. Therefore, profiled sutures might be a promising approach to improve biocompatibility of textile mesh prosthesis. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Change-Driven M100 Component in the Bilateral Secondary Somatosensory Cortex: A Magnetoencephalographic Study.", "abstract": "Our previous demonstration that the M100 somatosensory evoked magnetic field (SEF) has a similar temporal profile, dipole orientation and source location whether induced by activation (ON-M100) or deactivation (OFF-M100) of electrical stimulation suggests a common cortical system to detect sensory change. While we have not recorded such change-driven components earlier than M100 using electrical stimulation, clear M50 responses were reported using both ON and OFF mechanical stimulation (Onishi et al. in Clin Neurophysiol 121:588-593, 2010). To examine the significance of M50 and M100 in reflecting the detection of somatosensory changes, we recorded these waveforms in 12 healthy subjects (9 males and 3 females) by magnetoencephalography in response to mechanical stimulation from a piezoelectric actuator. Onset and offset (ON and OFF) stimuli were randomly presented with three preceding steady state (PSS) durations (0.5, 1.5 and 3\u00a0s) in one consecutive session. Results revealed that (i) onset and offset somatosensory events elicited clear M50 and M100 components; (ii) M50 and M100 components had distinct origins, with M50 localised to the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (cS1) and M100 to the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (iS2, cS2); and (iii) the amplitude of M50 in cS1 was independent of the PSS durations, whereas that of M100 in S2 was dependent on the PSS durations for both ON and OFF events. These findings suggest that the M50 amplitude in cS1 reflects the number of activated mechanoreceptors during Onset and Offset, whereas the M100 amplitude in S2 reflects change detection based on sensory memory for Onset and Offset stimuli at least in part. We demonstrated that the M50 in cS1 and M100 in S2 plays different roles in the change detection system in somatosensory modality.", "journal": "Brain topography", "date": "2018-11-18", "authors": ["KoyaYamashiro", "DaisukeSato", "HideakiOnishi", "KazuhiroSugawara", "NaofumiOtsuru", "HikariKirimoto", "ShoNakazawa", "YudaiYamazaki", "HiroshiShirozu", "AtsuoMaruyama"], "doi": "10.1007/s10548-018-0687-y"}

In this work, we investigate the ability to prevent co-ion repulsion by increasing complementary fixed charged within the electrode macropores by binding composite CDI electrodes with the ionically charged structural polysaccharides chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose. When employing asymmetrically charged electrode binders, co-ion repulsion was prevented, resulting in SAC and ENAS values that were three times greater than composite electrodes bound with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and similar to CDI electrodes composed of chemically modified carbon. Polysaccharide binders did not modify the charge balance in the carbon micropores but did shift the discharge voltage of maximum adsorption, enabling a shift in operating voltage that prolonged cycle lifetime without a significant loss in performance. The mechanism of improved salt accumulation with polysaccharide binders was explored with a one-dimensional model that integrated CDI and ion-exchange membrane covered (MCDI) sub-units.

This method remains very popular, but we have recently developed an alternative method that relies on nuclear injection rather than cell fusion. The advantages of nuclear injection include a shortened experimental procedure and reduced contamination of donor cytoplasm in the oocyte. In particular, only this method allows us to perform SCNT using dead cells or naked nuclei such as those from cadavers or body wastes.

The method relies on proper delivery of the editing reagents into zygotes, which is commonly achieved by a standard or slightly modified pronuclear microinjection technique. In this chapter, we describe in detail an alternative delivery method, named piezo-driven cytoplasmic microinjection, which offers a superior embryo survival and birth rate. Because this method uses a much wider injection needle than that in pronuclear injection, it allows a larger volume of the editing materials to be transported into the zygotes, leading to an increase in the targeting efficiency. This also eliminates the clogging issues seen regularly in pronuclear injection. Moreover, Cytochalasin B that is used to soften zygotes during piezo-driven microinjection has been suggested a role in improving the knockin efficiency, which provides an additional benefit to use this injection method.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2018-10-26", "authors": ["Melissa AScott", "Yueh-ChiangHu"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-8831-0_9"}

Especially in combination with the stem cell technology, these in vitro models of the human heart have generated interest not only of basic cardiovascular researchers but also of regulatory authorities responsible for drug safety. A main limitation of 3D-based assays for evaluating cardiotoxicity is their limited throughput. We integrated piezo-bending actuators in a 24-well system for the generation of strip-like rat and human EHT attached to hollow, elastic silicone posts. Muscle contractions of EHTs induced a measurable electrical current in the piezo-bending actuators that could be analysed for contraction amplitude, frequency, and contraction and relaxation kinetics. Compared with the standard video-optical analysis of contractile activity, the new system allows for (a) the analysis of several tissues in parallel, (b) switching between auxotonic and isometric contractions by inserting a stiff metal post in the silicone post opposing the piezo actuator, (c) continuous measurement over days with low data volume (megabyte), (d) automated measurement without the necessity of adjustment of tissue position for video-optical analysis, (e) reduced complexity and costs, (f) high sensitivity of contraction detection, (g) calculation of absolute contraction force, and (h) suitability for variable tissue geometries.

Our aims are to quantify the presence of both Piezo1 and 2 in enteric neurons throughout the gastrointestinal tract using immunohistochemistry and analyze their function(s) using neuroimaging techniques and pharmacological investigations. In order to perform a systematic and comparative study, we performed our experiments in gastrointestinal tissue from guinea pigs, mice and humans. Piezo1 (20-70%) is expressed by both enteric neuronal cell bodies and fibers in the myenteric and submucosal plexi of all the species investigated. Generally, Piezo1 expressing somata are more numerous in the submucosal plexus (50-80%) than in the myenteric plexus (15-35%) apart from the stomach where Piezo1 is expressed in up to 60% of cell bodies. Myenteric Piezo1 neurons mainly (60-100%) but not exclusively, also express nitric oxide synthase, a minority express choline acetyltransferase. In the submucosal plexus, Piezo1 neurons co-express vasoactive intestinal peptide (40-90%). Conversely, expression of Piezo2 is extremely rare in the somata of enteric neurons and is present in few neurites. In functional experiments, 38-76% of the mechanosensitive neurons expressed Piezo1 channels. Statistical analysis showed a positive significant correlation between mechanosensitive and Piezo1 positive neurons.

{"title": "Numerical evaluation of nonbonded piezo sensor for biomedical diagnostics using electromechanical impedance technique.", "abstract": "Directly bonded piezo sensor, conventionally employed in the electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique, although a proven candidate for structural health monitoring, is severely constrained in its application in the biomedical field due to its bonding requirement. In contrast, nonbonded piezo sensor (NBPS) provides a viable platform to assess the condition of human bones, tissues, and other biomedical subjects using the EMI technique without inflicting pain or irritation to the skin. The name NBPS was coined to emphasize that there was no direct bonding between the PZT patch and the live subject; instead, the PZT patch was bonded to a supporting medium, which maintains the mechanical interaction between the PZT patch and the subject. However, there are several aspects in the analysis of NBPS configuration that cannot be addressed completely through experimental study due to measurement constraints, cost, and time. For example, experimentally changing the density of bone continuously to study the osteoporosis effect is a tedious task warranting large number of specimens. This paper presents a detailed parametric study based on finite element method covering condition monitoring of human bones using the NBPS configuration. It is for the first time that 3D analysis for specimen identification and damage detection in bones using NBPS has been carried out. In addition to the validation of the numerical model against the previously established experimental studies involving bones, quantification of the extent of damage and its localization has been investigated. The density changes due to osteoporosis in bones are comprehensively investigated by the NBPS including the quantification aspect of osteoporosis/damage. Definite acquisition of bone signature and detection of physiological changes in bones are achieved even with the presence of skin, muscle, and fat layers on the bone.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2018-10-04", "authors": ["ShashankSrivastava", "SureshBhalla"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3160"}

Different from the classic dielectric piezoelectric medium, there are four kinds of coupled elastic waves, i.e. the quasi-longitudinal wave (QP), the quasi-traverse wave (QSV), the electric-acoustic wave (EA) and the electron or hole carriers wave (CP), in a piezoelectric semiconductor. The influences of the steady carrier density and biasing electric field upon the dispersion and attenuation features of these coupled elastic waves and the reflection amplitude ratios are studied numerically. The energy flux of each wave and the interaction energy fluxes among all waves are also calculated, and the energy flux balance is checked. It is found that the piezoelectric semiconductor behaves like the viscoelastic solid to carry a decaying wave.

{"title": "Electrical stimulation: Complementary therapy to improve the performance of grafts in bone defects?", "abstract": "The limitations of bone reconstruction techniques have stimulated the tissue engineering for the repair of large bone defects using osteoconductive materials and osteoinductive agents. This study evaluated the effects of low intensity electric current on the inorganic bovine graft in calvaria defects. Bone defects were performed with piezoelectric system in the calvaria of Wistar rats divided into four groups (n\u2009=\u200924): (C) without grafting and without electrical stimulation; (E) with grafting; (MC) without grafting and submitted to electrical stimulation; (MC\u2009+\u2009E) with grafting and submitted to electrical stimulation. Inflammatory, angiogenic and osteogenic events during bone repair at the 10th, 30th, 60th, and 90th days were considered. Several inflammatory markers demonstrated the efficacy of grafting in reducing inflammation, particularly when subjected to electrical stimulation. Angiogenesis and collagen organization were more evident by electrical stimulation application on the grafts. Moreover, the osteogenic cell differentiation process indicated that the application of microcurrent on grafting modulated the homeostasis of bone remodeling. It is concluded that microcurrent favored the performance of grafts in calvarial rat model. Low-intensity electrical current might improve the osteoconductive property of grafting in bone defects. Therefore, electrical current becomes an option as complementary therapy in clinical trials involving bone surgeries and injuries. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In addition to previous percutaneous (external perforating) and endonasal (internal) approaches, piezosurgery has been used in rhinoplasty practice since 2007.

Three groups were created from 12 animals, namely, endonasal continuous, external perforating, and piezosurgery groups. All the groups were evaluated for bone gaps, comminuted fractures, and nasal mucosa damage.\nThere were no comminuted fractures and mucosal defects in any of the samples in the piezo osteotomy group. The average amount of bone gap at the osteotomy site and the nasal mucosa damage was lower in the piezo group than in the other groups. The time required for the osteotomy was shorter in the endonasal group, similar to that in the external and piezo groups.\nNew techniques are constantly being developed to achieve better results in rhinoplasty. As a natural consequence to technological developments, new devices are being introduced to rhinoplasty practice. Piezo is one such device.

It has been shown that the PWAS and existing AE sensors successfully captured the AE signals from the fatigue crack growth in a thin aerospace specimen. Two experiments were conducted using the PWAS with each of the commercial AE sensors. For each experiment, two AE analyses were performed: (1) the hit-based analysis, (2) the waveform-based analysis. The fatigue loading was synchronized with the AE measurements. This allowed comparing the AE hits due to a particular AE event captured by PWAS and the other sensors. All the sensors showed a very similar pattern of AE hits as observed from the hit-based analysis. The AE waveform-based analysis was used to compare the waveforms and their frequency spectra captured by the three sensors. The commercial PICO showed ringing in the AE signals and showed a weak response in high-frequency region. The commercial S9225 had better signal-to-noise ratio but it also showed a weak response in high-frequency region.

The piezoelectric transducer converts the RF signal to acoustic waves in the optical fiber over a region including a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The elastic waves in the fiber modulates the FBG geometry and hence the reflected light in the optical fiber. Since the coil is much smaller than the RF wavelength and the signal is transmitted on the dielectric optical fiber, the sensor effectively reduces RF induced heating risk.

The hpDNA loops sequences of unpaired bases were studied in-silico to evaluate the binding versus four chemical classes (alcohols, aldehydes, esters and ketones) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The virtual binding score trend was correlated to the oligonucleotide size and increased of about 25% from tetramer to hexamer. Two tetramer and pentamer and three hexamer loops were selected to test the recognition ability of the DNA motif. The selection was carried out trying to maximize differences among chemical classes in order to evaluate the ability of the sensors to work as an array. All oligonucleotides showed similar trends with best binding scores for alcohols followed by esters, aldehydes and ketones.

In our system, hand pose is registered by an infrared camera and hand gestures are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. To display a rich set of haptic effects for both static and dynamic gestures, we integrated electromechanical and electrostatic actuation techniques effectively on tabletop surface of HapTable, which is a surface capacitive touch screen. We attached four piezo patches to the edges of tabletop to display vibrotactile feedback for static gestures. For this purpose, the vibration response of the tabletop, in the form of frequency response functions (FRFs), was obtained by a laser Doppler vibrometer for 84 grid points on its surface. Using these FRFs, it is possible to display localized vibrotactile feedback on the surface for static gestures. For dynamic gestures, we utilize the electrostatic actuation technique to modulate the frictional forces between finger skin and tabletop surface by applying voltage to its conductive layer. To our knowledge, this hybrid haptic technology is one of a kind and has not been implemented or tested on a tabletop. It opens up new avenues for gesture-based haptic interaction not only on tabletop surfaces but also on touch surfaces used in mobile devices with potential applications in data visualization, user interfaces, games, entertainment, and education. Here, we present two examples of such applications, one for static and one for dynamic gestures, along with detailed user studies. In the first one, user detects the direction of a virtual flow, such as that of wind or water, by putting their hand on the tabletop surface and feeling a vibrotactile stimulus traveling underneath it.

{"title": "Setup and initial testing of an endoscope manipulator system for assistance in transoral endoscopic surgery.", "abstract": "Purpose For the treatment of malignant diseases of the oral cavity and the larynx, a total or partial resection is the standard therapy, while in special cases chemo- and/or external radiation therapy is considered. Transoral access reduces trauma and hospitalization time. Transoral surgery is usually executed using external microscopic imaging. Therefore, the microscope is placed in the visual line of the opening of the mouth and throat. However, specific anatomical structures like the posterior commissure (dorsal end of the vocal cords) are not visible in these procedures. An endoscopic approach can improve this problem. We introduce a new prototype system for endoscopic assisted transoral surgery. Methods Based on clinical observation and discussions with professional users and surgeons, the clinical need was identified and specified. A general concept or an endoscopic manipulator to assist microlaryngeal surgery was designed. For that a steerable rigid endoscope was combined with an actuator that allows translational and rotational movement. A quick release fastener was designed allowing for fast change of the endoscope and independence from its shape and type. The actuator was fixed on a commercially available, semi-active medical holding arm for easy positioning. The holder can be fixed to the standard rails of the surgical table. The piezoelectric drives integrated in the actuator are activated with a foot pedal. This allows easy and fast fine positioning, while the hands are free to perform the surgery with standard instruments for microlaryngeal surgery. Results A prototype of the system for endoscopic assisted transoral surgery was developed. The entire technical setup was tested in terms of usability and performance in a simulated surgical scenario. A basic phantom, representing the throat and vocal cords was created and placed on a surgical table. The system was installed on the table and the clinical workflow of a simulated endoscopic assisted surgery on the vocal cords was performed. The performance of the setup and the procedure success was evaluated by clinical users. Conclusion Fixture of the system on the surgical table is fast and easy due to its low weight and compact design. The medical holder allows a fast initial positioning of the system in front of the phantom patient. An easy insertion and removal of the endoscope was realized using the quick release fastener. The developed endoscope fixation is universally adaptable and not limited to a single type of endoscope. The piezoelectric drives, combined with the foot pedal, allow a precise placement and readjustment of the endoscope during surgery. The use of a multi view endoscope enables a variable view on the surgical situs. The size and shape of the whole setup offer excellent access to the targeted structures.

{"title": "Adaptive Estimated Inverse Output-Feedback Quantized Control for Piezoelectric Positioning Stage.", "abstract": "Focusing on the piezoelectric positioning stage, this paper proposes an adaptive estimated inverse output-feedback quantized control scheme. First, the quantized issue due to the use of computer is addressed by introducing a linear time-varying quantizer model where the quantizer parameters can be estimated on-line. Second, by using the fuzzy approximator, the developed controller can avoid the identification of the parameters in the piezoelectric positioning stage. Third, by constructing the estimated inverse compensator of the hysteresis, the hysteresis nonlinearities in the piezoelectric actuator are mitigated; Fourth, the states observer is designed to avoid the measurements of the velocity and acceleration signals. The analysis of stability shows all the signals in the piezoelectric positioning stage are uniformly ultimately bounded and the prespecified tracking performance of the quantized control system is achieved by employing the error transformed function. Finally, a computer controlled experiments for the piezoelectric positioning stage is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantized controller.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on cybernetics", "date": "2018-07-12", "authors": ["XiuyuZhang", "YueWang", "ChenliangWang", "Chun-YiSu", "ZhiLi", "XinkaiChen"], "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2018.2826519"}
{"title": "Noninvasive Ultrasonic Neuromodulation in Freely Moving Mice.", "abstract": "Neuromodulation is a fundamental method for obtaining basic information about neuronal circuits for use in treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Ultrasound stimulation has become a promising approach for noninvasively inducing neuromodulation in animals and humans. However, the previous investigations were subject to substantial limitations, due to most of them involving anesthetized and fixed small-animal models. Studies of awake and freely moving animals are needed, but the currently used ultrasound devices are too bulky to be applied to a freely moving animal. This study is the first time to design and fabricate a miniature and lightweight head-mounted ultrasound stimulator for inducing neuromodulation in freely moving mice. The main components of the stimulator include a miniature piezoelectric ceramic, a concave epoxy acoustic lens, and housing and connection components. The device was able to induce action potentials recorded in situ and evoke head-turning behaviors by stimulating the primary somatosensory cortex barrel field of the mouse. These findings indicate that the proposed method can be used to induce noninvasive neuromodulation in freely moving mice. This novel method could potentially lead to the application of ultrasonic neuromodulation in more-extensive neuroscience investigations.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2018-07-12", "authors": ["GuofengLi", "WeibaoQiu", "ZhiqiangZhang", "QiujuJiang", "MinSu", "RuilinCai", "YongchuanLi", "FeiyanCai", "ZhitingDeng", "DiXu", "HuailingZhang", "HairongZheng"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2018.2821201"}

Following first premolar extraction, five radiographic-guided micro incisions and localized piezoelectric corticotomies were performed on the labial surfaces of the alveolar bone between the six anterior teeth in order to accelerate alignment for patients in the experimental group, whereas those in the control group received traditional orthodontic treatment. The overall alignment time (OAT) required to complete anterior alignment of the mandibular dental arch (OAT) was measured. Little's Irregularity Index (LII) was also calculated at monthly intervals. Randomization was performed using a software-generated list of random numbers; the recruited patients were divided into two parallel groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Assessor blinding was employed.\nOne hundred and eight severe dental crowding patients were evaluated for eligibility, 40 of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six participants were allocated to the treatment groups randomly. One female patient was lost to follow-up from the control group, and another female patient was excluded from analysis for the experimental group. Accordingly, the results of 34 patients were statistically analyzed. OAT was reduced by 59% in the experimental group compared to the control group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001). No harms were encountered.\nFlapless piezocision technique was very effective in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement.\nThis trial was registered at Clinical Trials.gov (Identifier: NCT02977221).", "journal": "European journal of orthodontics", "date": "2018-06-23", "authors": ["OmarGibreal", "Mohammad YHajeer", "BasselBrad"], "doi": "10.1093/ejo/cjy042"}
{"title": "Comparison between pulse wave velocities measured using Complior and measured using Biopac.", "abstract": "Arterial stiffness is a reliable prognostic parameter for cardiovascular diseases. The effect of change in arterial stiffness can be measured by the change of the pulse wave velocity (PWV). The Complior system is widely used to measure PWV between the carotid and radial arteries by means of piezoelectric clips placed around the neck and the wrist. The Biopac system is an easier to use alternative that uses ECG and simple optical sensors to measure the PWV between the heart and the fingertips, and thus extends a bit more to the peripheral vasculature compared to the Complior system. The goal of this study was to test under various conditions to what extent these systems provide comparable and correlating values. 25 Healthy volunteers, 20-30\u00a0years old, were measured in four sequential position: sitting, lying, standing and sitting. The results showed that the Biopac system measured consistently and significantly lower PWV values than the Complior system, for all positions. Correlation values and Bland-Altman plots showed that despite the difference in PWV magnitudes obtained by the two systems the measurements did agree well. Which implies that as long as the differences in PWV magnitudes are taken into account, either system could be used to measure PWV changes over time. However, when basing diagnosis on absolute PWV values, one should be very much aware of how the PWV was measured and with what system.", "journal": "Journal of clinical monitoring and computing", "date": "2018-06-08", "authors": ["Marit H Nvan Velzen", "Robert JanStolker", "Arjo JLoeve", "Sjoerd PNiehof", "Egbert GMik"], "doi": "10.1007/s10877-018-0165-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000033824.02722.F7\n10.1161/01.CIR.99.18.2434\n10.1161/01.HYP.37.5.1236\n10.1161/01.CIR.68.1.50\n10.1098/rspb.1922.0022\n10.1161/01.HYP.26.3.485\n10.1097/00004872-199816121-00033\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e32833057e8\n10.1161/01.CIR.37.2.149\n10.1111/j.1469-8986.1979.tb01519.x\n10.1088/0967-3334/37/1/52\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e32830a4a25\n10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01127.x"}

UCP was performed by EyeOP1, which delivers ultrasound beams using 6 piezoelectric transducers activated for 4/6 s (first generation) or 8 s (second generation). Primary outcomes were the mean IOP reduction and the rates of success after 1 year. Secondary outcomes were the mean IOP reduction at each follow-up, and the reduction of the number of hypotensive medications.\nIn total, 49 eyes from 47 patients were treated. One year postoperatively, the mean IOP had decreased from 27.7 \u00b1 9.2 to 19.8 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and the mean number of hypotensive drops and tablets had decreased from 3.2 and 0.5 to 2.3 and 0.2, respectively (p < 0.05). Postoperative IOP reduction was significantly related to preoperative IOP (r2 = 0.5034; p < 0.0001). Second-generation probes determined a significantly higher IOP reduction (p < 0.05). Qualified success was achieved in 25 eyes (51.1%) and complete success in 21 (42.9%), while failure was recorded in 12 (24.5%).\nUCP is safe and effective for reducing IOP.

Any type of clinical or animal study were searched for in MEDLINE/PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and SciVerse Scopus. Two independent reviewers screened titles/abstracts of articles and the full-text of potentially eligible studies. Comparisons of bone to implant contact and crestal bone loss were estimated using pairwise meta-analysis. Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The instruments identified in the articles were conventional drills (CDs), osteotome (OT), piezoelectric device (PD), Er:YAG LASER (LS) and osseodensification drills (ODs). The meta-analysis on bone to implant contact suggested no difference between CDs and other techniques and the meta-analysis on crestal bone loss suggested no difference between CDs and PD. The survival of implants in sites prepared with CDs vs. OT or PD presented no significant differences. The use of PD provided lower inflammatory response and earlier bone formation when compared to CDs. ODs provided significant biomechanical improvement in comparison to CDs. LS did not provide any relevant improvement in comparison to CDs or PD.
