Juss., when incubated with an aqueous solution of chloroaurate ions produces a diverse mixture of intracellular gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), especially nanotriangles (GNT) in the size range from 20 to 35 nm. These structures (GNT) are of special interest since they possess distinct plasmonic features in the visible and IR regions, which equipped them with unique physical and optical properties exploitable in vital applications such as optics, electronics, catalysis and biomedicine. The reaction process was simple and convenient to handle and was monitored using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis). The morphology and crystalline nature of the GNTs were determined from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy.

{"title": "Biofabrication of a three-dimensional liver micro-organ as an in vitro drug metabolism model.", "abstract": "In their normal in vivo matrix milieu, tissues assume complex well-organized three-dimensional architectures. Therefore, the primary aim in the tissue engineering design process is to fabricate an optimal analog of the in vivo scenario. This challenge can be addressed by applying emerging layered biofabrication approaches in which the precise configuration and composition of cells and bioactive matrix components can recapitulate the well-defined three-dimensional biomimetic microenvironments that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Furthermore, the advent of and refinements in microfabricated systems can present physical and chemical cues to cells in a controllable and reproducible fashion unmatched with conventional cultures, resulting in the precise construction of engineered biomimetic microenvironments on the cellular length scale in geometries that are readily parallelized for high throughput in vitro models. As such, the convergence of layered solid freeform fabrication (SFF) technologies along with microfabrication techniques enables the creation of a three-dimensional micro-organ device to serve as an in vitro platform for cell culture, drug screening or to elicit further biological insights, particularly for NASA's interest in a flight-suitable high-fidelity microscale platform to study drug metabolism in space and planetary environments. The proposed model in this paper involves the combinatorial setup of an automated syringe-based, layered direct cell writing bioprinting process with micro-patterning techniques to fabricate a microscale in vitro device housing a chamber of bioprinted three-dimensional liver cell-encapsulated hydrogel-based tissue constructs in defined design patterns that biomimic the cell's natural microenvironment for enhanced biological functionality. In order to assess the structural formability and biological feasibility of such a micro-organ, reproducibly fabricated tissue constructs were biologically characterized for liver cell-specific function. Another key facet of the in vivo microenvironment that was recapitulated with the in vitro system included the necessary dynamic perfusion of the three-dimensional microscale liver analog with cells probed for their collective drug metabolic function and suitability as a drug metabolism model. This paper details the principles and methods that undergird the direct cell writing biofabrication process development and adaptation of microfluidic devices for the creation of a drug screening model, thereby establishing a novel drug metabolism study platform for NASA's interest to adopt a microfluidic microanalytical device with an embedded three-dimensional microscale liver tissue analog to assess drug pharmacokinetic profiles in planetary environments.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2010-11-17", "authors": ["RobertChang", "KamalEmami", "HongluWu", "WeiSun"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/2/4/045004"}

X-ray diffraction results showed that the coatings obtained by the LPPS process were mainly composed of hydroxyapatite. The LPPS process also showed excellent control on the coating microstructure, and both nearly fully dense and highly porous hydroxyapatite coatings were obtained by simply adjusting the solid content of the hydroxyapatite liquid precursor. Scanning electron microscope observations indicated that the porous hydroxyapatite coatings had pore size in the range of 10-200 \u00b5m and an average porosity of 48.26 \u00b1 0.10%. The osteoblastic cell responses to the dense and porous hydroxyapatite coatings were evaluated with human osteoblastic cell MG-63, in respect of the cell morphology, proliferation and differentiation, with the hydroxyapatite coatings deposited by the atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) process as control. The cell experiment results indicated that the heat-treated LPPS coatings with a porous structure showed the best cell proliferation and differentiation among all the hydroxyapatite coatings.

With the increasing use of these systems in various fields, the development of benchtop systems for fabricating microdevices is emerging as an important challenge in their widespread use. Here we demonstrate a simple, low-cost and rapid method to fabricate PDMS microstructures by using micropatterned poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) master molds. In this method, PEGDA microstructures were patterned on a glass substrate by photolithography under ambient conditions and by using simple tools. The resulting PEGDA structures were subsequently used to generate PDMS microstructures by standard molding in a reproducible and repeatable manner. The thickness of the PEGDA microstructures was controllable from 15 to 300 \u00b5m by using commonly available spacer materials. We also demonstrate the use of this method to fabricate microfluidic channels capable of generating concentration gradients. In addition, we fabricated PEGDA microstructures by photolithography from the light generated from commonly available laminar cell culture hood.

Reduced platelet adhesion on a human umbilical vein endothelial cell-seeded hybrid scaffold as compared to bare PCL or FC PCL was observed, which suggests the non-thrombogenic nature of the tissue-engineered scaffold. Analysis of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after 5 days of endothelial cell (EC) culture on a hybrid scaffold indicated that the prothrombotic von Willebrand factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) were quiescent and stable. Meanwhile, dynamic expressions of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase indicated the desired cell phenotype on the scaffold. On the hybrid scaffold, shear stress could induce enhanced nitric oxide release, which implicates vaso-responsiveness of EC grown on the tissue-engineered construct. Significant upregulation of mRNA for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, collagen IV and elastin, in EC was detected by RT-PCR after growing them on the hybrid scaffold and FC-coated tissue culture polystyrene (FC TCPS) but not on FN-coated TCPS.

Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) and a free-radical photoinitiator are added to an aqueous lipid vesicle solution such that exposure to ultraviolet light results in solidification of neighboring aqueous volumes. Bilayer formation can occur both prior to photopolymerization with the aqueous mixture in the liquid state and after solidification by using the regulated attachment method (RAM) to attach the aqueous volumes contained within a flexible substrate. In addition, photopolymerization of the hydrogels can be performed in a separate mold prior to placement in the supporting substrate. Membranes formed across a wide range of hydrogel concentrations [0-80% (w/v); MW=1000 g/mol PEG-DMA] exhibit high electrical resistances (1-10 G\u03a9), which enable single-channel recordings of alamethicin channels and show significant durability and longevity.

This work aims to bring automated FGS production a step closer by providing a database that correlates scaffold porosity values and the corresponding compressive stiffness and integrating it into the design process. To achieve this goal, scaffolds with different structural configurations were designed using CASTS (Computer Aided System for Tissue Scaffolds), an in-house developed library system consisting of 13 different polyhedral units that can be assembled into scaffold structures. Polycaprolactone (PCL) was chosen as the scaffold material, while selective laser sintering, a powder-based rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing system was employed to fabricate the scaffolds.

While a number of techniques exist for creating living biological constructs in vitro, none have been demonstrated for in situ repair.

A calf femur was mounted in a custom jig and held within a robocasting-based additive manufacturing (AM) system. Two defects were induced: one a cartilage-only representation of a grade IV chondral lesion and the other a two-material bone and cartilage fracture of the femoral condyle. Alginate hydrogel was used for the repair of cartilage; a novel formulation of demineralized bone matrix was used for bone repair. Repair prints for both defects had mean surface errors less than 0.1 mm.

For the osteochondral defect, 83.6+/-2.7% of surface points had errors that were within clinically acceptable limits.

First, a ternary blend comprising PLGA/PS (polystyrene)/HA (40/40/20 wt%) was prepared by melt blending under conditions for formation of a co-continuous phase structure. Next, a dynamic annealing stage under small-strain oscillation was applied to the blend to facilitate nanoparticle redistribution. Finally, the PS phase was sacrificially extracted, leaving a porous matrix. The results from different characterizations suggested that the applied small-strain oscillation substantially accelerated the migration of HA nanoparticles during annealing from the PS phase to the PLGA phase; nearly all HA particles were uniformly presented in the PLGA phase after a short period of annealing. After dissolution of the PS phase, a PLGA material with interconnected microporous structure was successfully produced, with a high HA loading above 30 wt%.

In contrast to conventional macro-scale flow, microfluidics also offers unprecedented control over flow dynamics. In particular, laminar flow is readily achieved, allowing for new analytical and synthetic strategies. Here, two parallel flows of buffer and xylene were used to create a stable liquid-liquid interface within linear micro-channels. These, respectively, carried protein (albumin or fibrinogen) and an acyl chloride to effect protein crosslinking. This created robust, micro-membranes at the interface that bisected the fluid channel. Membrane formation was self-limiting, with fibrinogen membranes showing greater solute permeability than albumin, based on dye transport (Ponceau S, Meldola Blue). The crosslinker isophthaloyl dichloride led to thinner, less permeable membranes than terephthaloyl chloride. Larger surface area membranes formed at a static liquid-liquid interface served as a more physically accessible model and allowed precise electrochemical determination of acetaminophen, catechol and peroxide diffusion coefficients, which confirmed the greater fibrinogen permeability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the membranes also indicated a higher population of discrete nanopores at the fibrinogen surface. A crosslinking pH had a strong effect on overall permeability.

{"title": "Fabrication of three-dimensional porous cell-laden hydrogel for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "For tissue engineering applications, scaffolds should be porous to enable rapid nutrient and oxygen transfer while providing a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated cells. This dual characteristic can be achieved by fabrication of porous hydrogels that contain encapsulated cells. In this work, we developed a simple method that allows cell encapsulation and pore generation inside alginate hydrogels simultaneously. Gelatin beads of 150-300 microm diameter were used as a sacrificial porogen for generating pores within cell-laden hydrogels. Gelation of gelatin at low temperature (4 degrees C) was used to form beads without chemical crosslinking and their subsequent dissolution after cell encapsulation led to generation of pores within cell-laden hydrogels. The pore size and porosity of the scaffolds were controlled by the gelatin bead size and their volume ratio, respectively. Fabricated hydrogels were characterized for their internal microarchitecture, mechanical properties and permeability. Hydrogels exhibited a high degree of porosity with increasing gelatin bead content in contrast to nonporous alginate hydrogel. Furthermore, permeability increased by two to three orders while compressive modulus decreased with increasing porosity of the scaffolds. Application of these scaffolds for tissue engineering was tested by encapsulation of hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2). All the scaffolds showed similar cell viability; however, cell proliferation was enhanced under porous conditions. Furthermore, porous alginate hydrogels resulted in formation of larger spheroids and higher albumin secretion compared to nonporous conditions. These data suggest that porous alginate hydrogels may have provided a better environment for cell proliferation and albumin production.

Accordingly, here we investigated the effects of arrays of lines (ridge grooves) and holes of microscale (approximately 2 microm) and nanoscale (approximately 300 nm) dimensions, patterned in quartz (SiO2), on the (1) adhesion, (2) axon establishment (polarization), (3) axon length, (4) axon alignment and (5) cell morphology of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons, to study the response of the neurons to feature dimension and geometry. Neurons were analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The topographies were found to have a negligible effect on cell attachment but to cause a marked increase in axon polarization, occurring more frequently on sub-microscale features than on microscale features. Neurons were observed to form longer axons on lines than on holes and smooth surfaces; axons were either aligned parallel or perpendicular to the line features. An analysis of cell morphology indicated that the surface features impacted the morphologies of the soma, axon and growth cone. The results suggest that incorporating microscale and sub-microscale topographies on biomaterial surfaces may enhance the biomaterials' ability to modulate nerve development and regeneration.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2010-09-09", "authors": ["David YFozdar", "Jae YoungLee", "Christine ESchmidt", "ShaochenChen"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/2/3/035005"}

In this regard, Al/Al2O3 bi-phasic nanowires were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of the molecular precursor (tBuOAlH2)2. Heat treatment of such bi-phasic nanowires with short laser pulses leads to micro- and nanostructured Al2O3 surfaces. Such surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Following the detailed material characterization, the prepared surfaces were tested for their cell compatibility using normal human dermal fibroblasts. While the cells cultivated on Al/Al2O3 bi-phasic nanowires showed an unusual morphology, cells cultivated on nanowires treated with one and two laser pulses exhibited morphologies similar to those observed on the control substrate. The highest cell density was observed on surfaces treated with one laser pulse. The interaction of the cells with the nano- and microstructures was investigated by SEM analysis in detail. Laser treatment of Al/Al2O3 bi-phasic nanowires is a fast and easy method to fabricate nano- and microstructured Al2O3-surfaces for studying cell-surface interactions. It is our goal to develop a biocompatible Al2O3-surface which could be used as a coating material for medical implants exhibiting a cell selective response because of its specific physical landscape and especially because it promotes the adhesion of osteoblasts while minimizing the adhesion of fibroblasts.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2010-09-04", "authors": ["MVeith", "O CAktas", "WMetzger", "DSossong", "HUllah Wazir", "IGrobelsek", "NP\u00fctz", "GWennemuth", "TPohlemann", "MOberringer"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/2/3/035001"}

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the coated samples indicated the presence of precursor material, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (HA) and various other additional phases such as CaTiO3, Ca3(PO4)2, TiO2 (anatase) and TiO2 (rutile) owing to the reaction between the precursor (HA) and substrate (Ti-6Al-4V) during laser processing.

{"title": "Biofabrication to build the biology-device interface.", "abstract": "The last century witnessed spectacular advances in both microelectronics and biotechnology yet there was little synergy between the two. A challenge to their integration is that biological and electronic systems are constructed using divergent fabrication paradigms. Biology fabricates bottom-up with labile components, while microelectronic devices are fabricated top-down using methods that are 'bio-incompatible'. Biofabrication--the use of biological materials and mechanisms for construction--offers the opportunity to span these fabrication paradigms by providing convergent approaches for building the bio-device interface. Integral to biofabrication are stimuli-responsive materials (e.g. film-forming polysaccharides) that allow directed assembly under near physiological conditions in response to device-imposed signals. Biomolecular engineering, through recombinant technology, allows biological components to be endowed with information for assembly (e.g. encoded in a protein's amino acid sequence). Finally, self-assembly and enzymatic assembly provide the mechanisms for construction over a hierarchy of length scales. Here, we review recent advances in the use of biofabrication to build the bio-device interface. We anticipate that the biofabrication toolbox will expand over the next decade as more researchers enlist the unique construction capabilities of biology. Further, we look forward to observing the application of this toolbox to create devices that can better diagnose disease, detect pathogens and discover drugs.

{"title": "Tissue engineering by self-assembly and bio-printing of living cells.", "abstract": "Biofabrication of living structures with desired topology and functionality requires the interdisciplinary effort of practitioners of the physical, life and engineering sciences. Such efforts are being undertaken in many laboratories around the world. Numerous approaches are pursued, such as those based on the use of natural or artificial scaffolds, decellularized cadaveric extracellular matrices and, most lately, bioprinting. To be successful in this endeavor, it is crucial to provide in vitro micro-environmental clues for the cells resembling those in the organism. Therefore, scaffolds, populated with differentiated cells or stem cells, of increasing complexity and sophistication are being fabricated. However, no matter how sophisticated scaffolds are, they can cause problems stemming from their degradation, eliciting immunogenic reactions and other a priori unforeseen complications. It is also being realized that ultimately the best approach might be to rely on the self-assembly and self-organizing properties of cells and tissues and the innate regenerative capability of the organism itself, not just simply prepare tissue and organ structures in vitro followed by their implantation. Here we briefly review the different strategies for the fabrication of three-dimensional biological structures, in particular bioprinting.

The ability to influence the direction and structure in the formation of a vascular system is crucial in engineering tissue. Using biological laser printing (BioLP), we fabricated branch/stem structures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMC). The structure is simple as to mimic vascular networks in natural tissue but also allow cells to develop new, finer structures away from the stem and branches. Additionally, we printed co-culture structures by first depositing only HUVECs, followed by 24 h incubation to allow for adequate cell-cell communication and differentiation into lumina; these cell printed scaffold layers were then removed from incubation and inserted into the BioLP apparatus so that HUVSMCs could be directly deposited on top and around the previously printed HUVEC structures. The growth and differentiation of these co-culture structures was then compared to the growth of printed samples with either HUVECs or HUVSMCs alone. Lumen formation was found to closely mimic the original branch and stem structure. The beginning of a network structure is observed. HUVSMCs acted to limit HUVEC over-growth and migration when compared to printed HUVEC structures alone. HUVSMCs and HUVECS, when printed in close contact, appear to form cell-cell junctions around lumen-like structures. They demonstrate a symbiotic relationship which affects their development of phenotype when in close proximity of each other.

Before printing, metal and biological suspensions were formulated and then nebulized to form an aerosol which is aerodynamically focused on the printing module of the system in order to achieve precise structuring of the nanoscale material on a substrate. In this way, it is possible to focus the aerosol stream at a distance of about 5 mm from the printhead to the surface. This technology is useful for printing fluorescence-marked proteins and printing enzymes without affecting their biological activity. Furthermore, higher molecular weight DNA can be printed without shearing. The advantages, such as printing on complex, non-planar 3D structured surfaces, and disadvantages of the aerosol printing technology are also discussed and are compared with other printing technologies. In addition, miniaturized sensor structures with line thicknesses in the range of a few micrometers are fabricated by applying a silver sensor structure to glass. After sintering using an integrated laser or in an oven process, electrical conductivity is achieved within the sensor structure.

Bioprinting can be defined as the use of computer-aided transfer processes for patterning and assembling living and non-living materials with a prescribed 2D or 3D organization in order to produce bio-engineered structures serving in regenerative medicine, pharmacokinetic and basic cell biology studies. The use of bioprinting technology for biofabrication of in vitro assay has been shown to be a realistic short-term application. At the same time, the principal feasibility of bioprinting vascularized human organs as well as in vivo bioprinting has been demonstrated. The bioprinting of complex 3D human tissues and constructs in vitro and especially in vivo are exciting, but long-term, applications. It was decided that the 5th International Conference on Bioprinting and Biofabrication would be held in Philadelphia, USA in October 2010. The specially appointed 'Eploratory Committee' will consider the possibility of turning the growing bioprinting community into a more organized entity by creating a new bioprinting and biofabrication society. The new journal Biofabrication was also presented at 3B'09. This is an important milestone per se which provides additional objective evidence that the bioprinting and biofabrication field is consolidating and maturing. Thus, it is safe to state that bioprinting technology is coming of age.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2010-09-03", "authors": ["FabienGuillemot", "VladimirMironov", "MakotoNakamura"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/2/1/010201"}

The piston-assisted microsyringe (PAM2) is a rapid prototyping technology specifically developed for low-shear stress extrusion of viscous hydrogel solutions containing cells. In this article the working parameters of the system were established to guarantee the realization of spatially controlled hydrogel scaffolds. Moreover the shear stresses acting on the cell membrane during extrusion was investigated through a computational fluid-dynamic analysis. The computational models show that the shear stress on the cells is of the order of 100 Pa during the extrusion process. HepG2 cells encapsulated in alginate were then extruded into spatially organized hepatic lobule-like architectures and their viability and function were evaluated. The results show that the metabolic fingerprint of the cells is preserved with respect to controls and the cells are uniformly distributed through the gel scaffold.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

In this study, a computer-aided biofabrication technique based on laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) is used to generate grafts consisting of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We demonstrate that (i) laser printing does not cause any cell damage; (ii) laser-printed MSC grafts can be differentiated toward bone and cartilage; (iii) LIFT allows printing of cell densities high enough for the promotion of chondrogenesis; (iv) with LIFT three-dimensional scaffold-free autologous tissue grafts can be fabricated keeping their predefined structure, and (v) predifferentiated MSCs survived the complete printing procedure and kept their functionality.

{"title": "In vitro: osteoclastic activity studies on surfaces of 3D printed calcium phosphate scaffolds.", "abstract": "Various biomaterials have been developed for the use as bone substitutes for bone defects. To optimize their integration and functionality, they should be adapted to the individual defect. Rapid prototyping is a manufacturing method to tailor materials to the 3D geometry of the defect. Especially 3D printing allows the manufacture of implants, the shape of which can be designed to fit the bone defect using anatomical information obtained from the patient. 3D printing of calcium phosphates, which are well established as bone substitutes, involves a sintering step after gluing the granules together by a binder liquid. In this study, we analyzed if and how these 3D printed calcium phosphate surfaces can be resorbed by osteoclast-like cells. On 3D printed scaffold surfaces consisting of pure HA and \u03b2-TCP as well as a biphasic mixture of HA and TCP the osteoclastic cell differentiation was studied. In this regard, cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation were analyzed with the monocytic cell line RAW 264.7. The results show that osteoclast-like cells were able to resorb calcium phosphate surfaces consisting of granules. Furthermore, biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics exhibit, because of their osteoclastic activation ability, the most promising surface properties to serve as 3D printed bone substitute scaffolds.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2010-07-28", "authors": ["RainerDetsch", "SusannneSchaefer", "UlrikeDeisinger", "GuenterZiegler", "HermannSeitz", "BarbaraLeukers"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328210373285"}

However, the absence of effective methods of accelerated tissue maturation immediately after bioprinting is the main technological imperative and potential impediment for further progress in the development of this emerging organ printing technology. Identification of the optimal combination of factors and conditions that accelerate tissue maturation ('maturogenic' factors) is an essential and necessary endeavour. Screening of maturogenic factors would be most efficiently accomplished using high-throughput quantitative in vitro tissue maturation assays. We have recently reviewed the formation of solid scaffold-free tissue constructs through the fusion of bioprinted tissue spheroids that have measurable material properties. We hypothesize that the fusion kinetics of these tissue spheroids will provide an efficacious in vitro assay of the level of tissue maturation. We report here the results of experimental testing of two simple quantitative tissue spheroid fusion-based in vitro high-throughput screening assays of tissue maturation: (a) a tissue spheroid envelopment assay; and (b) a tissue spheroid fusion kinetics assay.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2010-07-07", "authors": ["ZoltanHajdu", "VladimirMironov", "Agnes NagyMehesz", "Russell ANorris", "Roger RMarkwald", "Richard PVisconti"], "doi": "10.1002/term.291"}

High resolution and high speed organization of cells are some of the key requirements for the successful fabrication of cell-containing two or three dimensional constructs. So far, none of the available cell printing technologies has shown an ability to concomitantly print cells at a cell-level resolution and at a kHz range speed. We have studied the effect of the viscosity of the bioink, laser energy, and laser printing speed on the resolution of cell printing.

{"title": "Combined micro and macro additive manufacturing of a swirling flow coaxial phacoemulsifier sleeve with internal micro-vanes.", "abstract": "Microstereolithography (microSL) technology can fabricate complex, three-dimensional (3D) microstructures, although microSL has difficulty producing macrostructures with micro-scale features. There are potentially many applications where 3D micro-features can benefit the overall function of the macrostructure. One such application involves a medical device called a coaxial phacoemulsifier where the tip of the phacoemulsifier is inserted into the eye through a relatively small incision and used to break the lens apart while removing the lens pieces and associated fluid from the eye through a small tube. In order to maintain the eye at a constant pressure, the phacoemulsifier also includes an irrigation solution that is injected into the eye during the procedure through a coaxial sleeve. It has been reported, however, that the impinging flow from the irrigation solution on the corneal endothelial cells in the inner eye can damage these cells during the procedure. As a result, a method for reducing the impinging flow velocities and the resulting shear stresses on the endothelial cells during this procedure was explored, including the design and development of a complex, 3D micro-vane within the sleeve. The micro-vane introduces swirl into the irrigation solution, producing a flow with rapidly dissipating flow velocities. Fabrication of the sleeve and fitting could not be accomplished using microSL alone, and thus, a two-part design was accomplished where a sleeve with the micro-vane was fabricated with microSL and a threaded fitting used to attach the sleeve to the phacoemulsifier was fabricated using an Objet Eden 333 rapid prototyping machine. The new combined device was tested within a water container using particle image velocimetry, and the results showed successful swirling flow with an ejection of the irrigation fluid through the micro-vane in three different radial directions corresponding to the three micro-vanes. As expected, the sleeve produced a swirling flow with rapidly dissipating streamwise flow velocities where the maximum measured streamwise flow velocities using the micro-vane were lower than those without the micro-vane by 2 mm from the tip where they remained at approximately 70% of those produced by the conventional sleeve as the flow continued to develop. It is believed that this new device will reduce damage to endothelial cells during cataract surgery and significantly improve patient outcomes from this procedure. This unique application demonstrates the utility of combining microSL with a macro rapid prototyping technology for fabricating a real macro-scale device with functional, 3D micro-scale features that would be difficult and costly to fabricate using alternative manufacturing methods.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2010-06-22", "authors": ["Jae-WonChoi", "MasakiYamashita", "JunSakakibara", "YuichiKaji", "TetsuroOshika", "Ryan BWicker"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-010-9442-1"}
{"title": "Bioprinting vessel-like constructs using hyaluronan hydrogels crosslinked with tetrahedral polyethylene glycol tetracrylates.", "abstract": "Bioprinting enables deposition of cells and biomaterials into spatial orientations and complexities that mirror physiologically relevant geometries. To facilitate the development of bioartificial vessel-like grafts, two four-armed polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives with different PEG chain lengths, TetraPEG8 and TetraPEG13, were synthesized from tetrahedral pentaerythritol derivatives. The TetraPEGs are unique multi-armed PEGs with a compact and symmetrical core. The TetraPEGs were converted to tetra-acrylate derivatives (TetraPAcs) which were used in turn to co-crosslink thiolated hyaluronic acid and gelatin derivatives into extrudable hydrogels for printing tissue constructs. First, the hydrogels produced by TetraPAc crosslinking showed significantly higher shear storage moduli when compared to PEG diacrylate (PEGDA)-crosslinked synthetic extracellular matrices (sECMs) of similar composition. These stiffer hydrogels have rheological properties more suited to bioprinting high-density cell suspensions. Second, TetraPAc-crosslinked sECMs were equivalent or superior to PEGDA-crosslinked gels in supporting cell growth and proliferation. Third, the TetraPac sECMs were employed in a proof-of-concept experiment by encapsulation of NIH 3T3 cells in sausage-like hydrogel macrofilaments. These macrofilaments were then printed into tubular tissue constructs by layer-by-layer deposition using the Fab@Home printing system. LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity-stained cross-sectional images showed the bioprinted cell structures to be viable in culture for up to 4 weeks with little evidence of cell death. Thus, biofabrication of cell suspensions in TetraPAc sECMs demonstrates the feasibility of building bioartificial blood vessel-like constructs for research and potentially clinical uses.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2010-06-16", "authors": ["AleksanderSkardal", "JianxingZhang", "Glenn DPrestwich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.04.045"}

Here we report the biosynthesis of extracellular silver-based single nanocrystallites of well-defined composition and homogeneous morphology utilizing the gamma-proteobacterium, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, upon incubation with aqueous silver nitrate solution. Further characterization of these particles revealed that the crystals consist of small, reasonably monodispersed spheres in the 2-11 nm size range (average of 4 +/- 1.5 nm). The bactericidal effect of these nanoparticles (biogenic-Ag) is compared to chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles (colloidal-Ag and oleate capped silver nanoparticles, oleate-Ag) and assessed using Gram-negative (E. coli and S. oneidensis) and Gram-positive (B. subtilis) bacteria. Relative toxicity was based on the diameter of inhibition zone in disk diffusion tests, minimum inhibitory concentrations, live/dead assays, and atomic force microscopy. From a toxicity perspective, strain-dependent inhibition depended on the synthesis procedure and the surface coat. Biogenic-Ag was found to be of higher toxicity compared to colloidal-Ag for all three strains tested, whereas E. coli and S. oneidensis were found to be more resistant to either of these nanoparticles than B. subtilis. In contrast, oleate-Ag was not toxic to any of the bacteria. These findings have implications for the potential uses of Ag nanomaterials and for their fate in biological and environmental systems.", "journal": "Environmental science & technology", "date": "2010-06-01", "authors": ["Anil KSuresh", "Dale APelletier", "WeiWang", "Ji-WonMoon", "BaohuaGu", "Ninell PMortensen", "David PAllison", "David CJoy", "Tommy JPhelps", "Mitchel JDoktycz"], "doi": "10.1021/es903684r"}

Inclusion bodies have been widely described as spherical or pseudo-spherical particles with only minor morphological variability, mostly restricted to their size. Here we have identified a cellular gene in Escherichia coli (clpP) that controls the in vivo fabrication process of inclusion bodies. In the absence of the encoded protease, the dynamics of protein deposition is perturbed, resulting in unusual tear-shaped particles with enhanced surface-volume ratios.

First, we synthesized the methacrylated ethanolamide derivative of gelatin (GE-MA). Second, partial photochemical cocrosslinking of GE-MA with methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HA-MA) gave an extrudable gel-like fluid. Third, the new HA-MA:GE-MA hydrogels were biocompatible, supporting cell attachment and proliferation of HepG2 C3A, Int-407, and NIH 3T3 cells in vitro. Moreover, hydrogels injected subcutaneously in nude mice produced no inflammatory response. Fourth, using the Fab@Home printing system, we printed a tubular tissue construct. The partially crosslinked hydrogels were extruded from a syringe into a designed base layer, and irradiated again to create a firmer structure. The computer-driven protocol was iterated to complete a cellularized tubular construct with a cell-free core and a cell-free structural halo.

To achieve high-quality DNA synthesis, a SiO(2) thin film array was prepatterned on the inert and hydrophobic COC surface using RF sputtering technique. The subsequent in situ DNA synthesis was confined to the surface of the prepatterned hydrophilic SiO(2) thin film features by precision delivery of the phosphoramidite chemistry using an inkjet DNA synthesizer.

Of particular interest is the fabrication of complex functional (biocompatible) mesh arrays. Mesh elements or unit cells can be divided into different regions in order to use different cell designs in different areas of the component to produce various or continually varying (functionally graded) mesh densities. Numerous design elements have been used to fabricate prototypes by AM using EBM of Ti-6Al-4V powders, where the densities have been compared with the elastic (Young) moduli determined by resonant frequency and damping analysis. Density optimization at the bone-implant interface can allow for bone ingrowth and cementless implant components. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of metal (aluminium alloy) foam have also allowed for the building of Ti-6Al-4V foams by embedding the digital-layered scans in computer-aided design or software models for EBM. Variations in mesh complexity and especially strut (or truss) dimensions alter the cooling and solidification rate, which alters the alpha-phase (hexagonal close-packed) microstructure by creating mixtures of alpha/alpha' (martensite) observed by optical and electron metallography.

The reality of complex business planning and the high-investment, high-technology environment was not apparent, and the promise of tissue engineering was overstated. In the meantime, biologists were steadily applying three-dimensional benchtop tissue-culture systems for cellular research, but the systems were gelatinous and thus limited in their ability to facilitate the development of complex tissues. Now, the bioengineering literature has seen an emergence of literature describing biofabrication of tissues and organs. However, if one looks closely, again, the viable products appear distant. 'Rapid' prototyping to reproduce the intricate patterns of whole organs using large volumes of cellular components faces daunting challenges. Homogenous forms are being labelled 'tissues', but, in fact, do not represent the heterogeneous structure of the native biological system.

It is concluded that the feasibility of the additive manufacturing approach has been demonstrated, and further development of a mass customization system to deliver orthoses, together with exploitation of the design freedom offered by the manufacturing method, will give the overall approach significant clinical potential.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2010-03-10", "authors": ["Jari H PPallari", "Kenneth WDalgarno", "JamesWoodburn"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2010.2044178"}

We report a tissue engineering technique to print murine neural stem cells (C17.2), collagen hydrogel, and GF (vascular endothelial growth factor: VEGF)-releasing fibrin gel to construct an artificial neural tissue. We examined the morphological changes of the printed C17.2 cells embedded in the collagen and its migration toward the fibrin gel. The cells showed high viability (92.89+/-2.32%) after printing, which was equivalent to that of manually-plated cells. C17.2 cells printed within 1mm from the border of VEGF-releasing fibrin gel showed GF-induced changes in their morphology. The cells printed in this range also migrated toward the fibrin gel, with the total migration distance of 102.4+/-76.1microm over 3days. The cells in the control samples (fibrin without the VEGF or VEGF printed directly in collagen) neither proliferated nor migrated. The results demonstrated that bio-printing of VEGF-containing fibrin gel supported sustained release of the GF in the collagen scaffold.

Fifteen fetuses were normal and evaluated only by 3DUS. Eighteen cases had abnormalities such as conjoined twins, tumors, aneuploidy, skeletal abnormalities, central nervous system abnormalities and facial or thoracic defects. Scans were performed using high-resolution 3DUS. In cases of abnormalities, MRI and CT were performed on the same day as 3DUS. The images obtained with 3DUS, CT or MRI were exported to a workstation in DICOM format. A single observer performed slice-by-slice manual segmentation using a digital high-definition screen. Software that converts medical images into numerical models was used to construct virtual 3D models, which were physically realized using additive manufacturing technologies.\nPhysical models based on 3DUS, MRI and CT images either separately or combined were successfully generated. They were remarkably similar to the postnatal appearance of the aborted fetus or newborn baby, especially in cases with pathology.\nThe use of 3DUS, MRI and CT may improve our understanding of fetal anatomical characteristics, and these technologies can be used for educational purposes and as a method for parents to visualize their unborn baby.

Human periosteum cells were cultured using an osteogenic medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, Penicillin, Streptomycin and ascorbic acid at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2). Three scaffolds were tested: 3D-printed HA, 3D-printed TCP and bovine HA. Cell vitality was assessed by Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) and Propidium Iodide (PI) staining, biocompatibility with LDH, MTT, WST and BrdU tests, and scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed with ANOVAs.\nAfter 24 h all samples showed viable periosteal cells, mixed with some dead cells for the bovine HA group and very few dead cells for the printed HA and TCP groups. The biocompatibility tests revealed that proliferation on all scaffolds after treatment with eluate was sometimes even higher than controls. Scanning electron microscopy showed that periosteal cells formed layers covering the surfaces of all scaffolds 7 days after seeding.\nIt can be concluded from our data that the tested materials are biocompatible for periosteal cells and thus can be used as scaffolds to augment bone using tissue engineering methods.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

As in native organs, a tissue-engineered intra-organ vascular tree must be comprised of a network of hierarchically branched vascular segments. Despite this requirement, current tissue-engineering efforts are still focused predominantly on engineering either large-diameter macrovessels or microvascular networks.\nWe present the emerging concept of organ printing or robotic additive biofabrication of an intra-organ branched vascular tree, based on the ability of vascular tissue spheroids to undergo self-assembly.\nThe feasibility and challenges of this robotic biofabrication approach to intra-organ vascularization for tissue engineering based on organ-printing technology using self-assembling vascular tissue spheroids including clinically relevantly vascular cell sources are analyzed.\nIt is not possible to engineer 3D thick tissue or organ constructs without effective vascularization. An effective intra-organ vascular system cannot be built by the simple connection of large-diameter vessels and microvessels.

{"title": "Three dimensional multi-scale modelling and analysis of cell damage in cell-encapsulated alginate constructs.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in scaffold guided regenerative therapies is identifying the essential cues such as mechanical forces that induce cellular responses to form functional tissue. Developing multi-scale modelling methods would facilitate in predicting responses of encapsulated cells for controlling and maintaining the cell phenotype in an engineered tissue construct, when mechanical loads are applied. The objective of this study is to develop a 3D multi-scale numerical model for analyzing the stresses and deformations of the cell when the tissue construct is subjected to macro-scale mechanical loads and to predict load-induced cell damage. Specifically, this methodology characterizes the macro-scale structural behavior of the scaffold, and quantifies 3D stresses and deformations of the cells at the micro-scale and at a cellular level, wherein individual cell components are incorporated. Assuming that cells have inherent ability to sustain a critical load without damage, a damage criterion is established and a stochastic simulation is employed to predict the percentage cell viability within the tissue constructs. Bio-printed cell-alginate tissue constructs were tested with 1%, 5% and 10% compression strain applied and the cell viability were characterized experimentally as 23.2+/-16.8%, 9.0+/-5.4% and 4.6+/-2.1%. Using the developed method, the corresponding micro-environments of the cells were analyzed, the mean critical compressive strain was determined as 0.5%, and the cell viability was predicted as 26.6+/-7.0, 13.3+/-4.5, and 10.1+/-2.8.

{"title": "Ceramic scaffolds produced by computer-assisted 3D printing and sintering: characterization and biocompatibility investigations.", "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite (HAP) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) are two very common ceramic materials for bone replacement. However, in general HAP and TCP scaffolds are not tailored to the exact dimensions of the defect site and are mainly used as granules or beads. Some scaffolds are available as ordinary blocks, but cannot be customized for individual perfect fit. Using computer-assisted 3D printing, an emerging rapid prototyping technique, individual three-dimensional ceramic scaffolds can be built up from TCP or HAP powder layer by layer with subsequent sintering. These scaffolds have precise dimensions and highly defined and regular internal characteristics such as pore size. External shape and internal characteristics such as pore size can be fabricated using Computer Assisted Design (CAD) based on individual patient data. Thus, these scaffolds could be designed as perfect fit replacements to reconstruct the patient's skeleton. Before their use as bone replacement materials in vivo, in vitro testing of these scaffolds is necessary. In this study, the behavior of human osteoblasts on HAP and TCP scaffolds was investigated. The commonly used bone replacement material BioOss(R) served as control. Biocompatibility was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fluorescence microscopy after staining for cell vitality with fluorescin diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) and the MTT, LDH, and WST biocompatibility tests. Both versions were colonised by human osteoblasts, however more cells were seen on HAP scaffolds than TCP scaffolds. Cell vitality staining and MTT, LDH, and WST tests showed superior biocompatibility of HAP scaffolds to BioOss, while BioOss was more compatible than TCP. Further experiments are necessary to determine biocompatibility in vivo. Future modifications of 3D printed scaffolds offer advantageous features for Tissue Engineering. The integration of channels could allow for vascular and nerve ingrowth into the scaffold.

This work focuses on the combination of this bottom-up biologically inspired fabrication method with standard top-down micromachining processes that allow direct integration of the virus-structured materials into batch-fabricated devices. Photolithographic patterning of uncoated as well as nickel-coated TMV nanostructures has been achieved using a lift-off process in both solvent and mild basic solutions and their assembly onto three-dimensional polymer and silicon microstructures is demonstrated. In addition to these patterning techniques, in situ formation of metal oxide TMV coatings in patterned microfabricated environments is shown using atomic layer deposition directly on the nickel-coated viruses.

Semicircular patterns of BMP-2 were printed within circular DermaMatrix human allograft scaffold constructs. The contralateral halves of the constructs were unprinted or printed with BMP-2 modifiers, including the BMP-2 inhibitor, noggin. Printed bio-ink pattern retention was validated using fluorescent or (125)I-labeled bio-inks. Mouse C2C12 progenitor cells cultured on patterned constructs differentiated in a dose-dependent fashion toward an osteoblastic fate in register to BMP-2 patterns. The fidelity of spatial restriction of osteoblastic differentiation at the boundary between neighboring BMP-2 and noggin patterns improved in comparison with patterns without noggin. Acellular DermaMatrix constructs similarly patterned with BMP-2 and noggin were then implanted into a mouse calvarial defect model. Patterns of bone formation in vivo were comparable with patterned responses of osteoblastic differentiation in vitro.

{"title": "In situ generation of pH gradients in microfluidic devices for biofabrication of freestanding, semi-permeable chitosan membranes.", "abstract": "We report the in situ generation of pH gradients in microfluidic devices for biofabrication of freestanding, semi-permeable chitosan membranes. The pH-stimuli-responsive polysaccharide chitosan was enlisted to form a freestanding hydrophilic membrane structure in microfluidic networks where pH gradients are generated at the converging interface between a slightly acidic chitosan solution and a slightly basic buffer solution. A simple and effective pumping strategy was devised to realize a stable flow interface thereby generating a stable, well-controlled and localized pH gradient. Chitosan molecules were deprotonated at the flow interface, causing gelation and solidification of a freestanding chitosan membrane from a nucleation point at the junction of two converging flow streams to an anchoring point where the two flow streams diverge to two output channels. The fabricated chitosan membranes were about 30-60 microm thick and uniform throughout the flow interface inside the microchannels. A T-shaped membrane formed by sequentially fabricating orthogonal membranes demonstrates flexibility of the assembly process. The membranes are permeable to aqueous solutions and are removed by mildly acidic solutions. Permeability tests suggested that the membrane pore size was a few nanometres, i.e., the size range of antibodies. Building on the widely reported use of chitosan as a soft interconnect for biological components and microfabricated devices and the broad applications of membrane functionalities in microsystems, we believe that the facile, rapid biofabrication of freestanding chitosan membranes can be applied to many biochemical, bioanalytical, biosensing applications and cellular studies.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2009-12-22", "authors": ["XiaolongLuo", "Dean LariosBerlin", "JordanBetz", "Gregory FPayne", "William EBentley", "Gary WRubloff"], "doi": "10.1039/b916548g"}

In contrast to common methods, the generation of porous titaniumproducts by selective electron beam melting (SEBM), an additive manufacturing technology, overcomes difficulties concerning the extreme chemical affinity of liquid titanium to atmospheric gases which consequently leads to strongly reduced ductility of the metal. The purpose of this study was to assess the suitability of a smooth compact and a porous Ti-6Al-4V structure directly produced by the SEBM process as scaffolds for bone formation. SEBM-processed titanium implants were placed into defects in the frontal skull of 15 domestic pigs. To evaluate the direct contact between bone and implant surfaces and to assess the ingrowth of osseous tissue into the porous structure, microradiographs and histomorphometric analyses were performed 14, 30, and 60 days after surgery. Bone ingrowth increased significantly during the period of this study. After 14 days the most outer regions of the implants were already filled with newly formed bone tissue (around 14%). After 30 days the bone volume inside the implants reached almost 30% and after 60 days abundant bone formation inside the implants attained 46%. During the study only scarce bone-implant contact was found around all implants, which did not exceed 9% around compact specimens and 6% around porous specimens after 60 days.
