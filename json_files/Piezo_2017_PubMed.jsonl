Unfortunately, unacceptable positioning errors always appear because of the natural hysteresis effect of the piezoelectric materials. This natural property must be mitigated in practical applications. For solving this drawback, a nonlinear positioning design is proposed in this article. This nonlinear positioning design of piezoelectric materials is realized by the following four steps: 1. The famous Bouc\u207bWen model is utilized to present the input and output behaviors of piezoelectric materials; 2. System parameters of the Bouc\u207bWen model that describe the characteristics of piezoelectric materials are simultaneously identified with the particle swam optimization method; 3. Stability verification for the identified Bouc\u207bWen model; 4. A nonlinear feedback linearization control design is derived for the nano-scale positioning design of the piezoelectric material, mathematically. One important contribution of this investigation is that the positioning error between the output displacement of the controlled piezoelectric materials and the desired trajectory in nano-scale level can be proven to converge to zero asymptotically, under the effect of the hysteresis.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2018-11-08", "authors": ["Yung YueChen", "Yung HsiangChen", "Chiung YauHuang"], "doi": "10.3390/mi8120360\n10.1016/0304-8853(86)90066-1\n10.1109/TAC.2005.849205\n10.1177/1045389X9800900605\n10.3166/ejc.9.407-418\n10.1007/s11831-009-9031-8\n10.1016/j.sysconle.2006.09.001\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/12/031\n10.1299/kikaic.73.577\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1561674"}

Many such devices are resonant scanners, and thus their linear and nonlinear dynamic behaviors have been studied in the past. Thin-film piezoelectric materials, in contrast, provide sufficient energy density to achieve both large static displacements and high-frequency resonance, but large deformation can in turn influence dynamic scanner behavior. This paper reports on the influence of very large stroke translation of a piezoelectric vertical actuator on its resonant behavior, which may not be otherwise explained fully by common causes of resonance shift such as beam stiffening or nonlinear forcing. To examine the change of structural compliance over the course of scanner motion, a model has been developed that includes internal forces from residual stress and the resultant additional multi-axis coupling among actuator leg structures.

The equivalence of 5 and 10years was respectively selected as the time of aging. The physicochemical evolutions of membrane aging are characterized on the base of morphology analysis, chemical components, permeation ability and mechanical properties. The aging of NIPS-PVDF membrane led to the elimination of surface hydrophilic additives, while NaOH focused on the dehydrofluorination process resulting in the formation of conjugated chains of polyene on the skeleton structure. The chemical components of the surface of TIPS-PVDF membrane were removed continuously during the aging processes of both NaClO and NaOH, which was caused by the saponification of surface additives and the chain scissions of skeleton structure, but without producing any obvious conjugated chains of polyene. All the aging processes led to the increase of contact angle and the decrease of mechanical properties, and the permeability was reduced first and increased later due to the enlargement of surface membrane pores and membrane block.

In a typical imaging system, the optical setup is kept fixed and either the sample or the objective is translated with a mechanical stage driven by a stepper motor or a piezoelectric element. Mechanical Z scanning is precise, but its slow response and vulnerability to mechanical vibrations and stress make it disadvantageous to image dynamic, time-varying samples such as live cell structures. An alternative method less susceptible to these problems is to change the focal plane using conjugate optics. Deformable mirrors, acoustooptics, and electrically tunable lenses have been experimented with to achieve this goal and have attained very fast and precise Z-scanning without physically moving the sample. Here, we present the use of a liquid lens for fast axial scanning. Liquid lenses have a long functional life, high degree of phase shift, and low sensitivity to mechanical stress.

To prevent leaching and aggregation, nanoparticle catalysts were integrated into membrane domains functionalized with poly (acrylic acid). Nanoparticles of 16-19 nm were observed inside the membrane pores by using focused ion beam (FIB). This technique prevents mechanical deformation of the membrane, compared to the normal SEM preparation methods, thus providing a clean, smooth surface for nanoparticles characterization. This allowed quantification of nanoparticle properties (size and distribution) versus depth underneath the membrane surface (0-20 \u00b5m). The results showed that nanoparticles were uniformly sized and evenly distributed inside the membrane pores. However, the size of nanoparticles inside the membrane pores was 13.9% smaller than those nanoparticles located on the membrane surface. Investigating nanoparticles inside membrane pores increases the accuracy of kinetic analysis and modeling aspects. Furthermore, the Fe/Pd immobilized membranes showed excellent performance in the degradation of chlorinated organics: Over 96% degradation of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) was achieved in less than 15 s residence time in convective flow mode.

{"title": "Acoustic manipulation: Bessel beams and active carriers.", "abstract": "In this paper, we address the interaction of zero-order acoustic Bessel beams as an acoustic manipulation tool, with an active spherical shell, as a carrier in drug, agent, or material delivery systems, in order to investigate the controllability of exerted acoustic radiation force as the driver. The active body is comprised of a spherical elastic shell stimulated in its monopole mode of vibrations with the same frequency as the incident wave field via an internally bonded and spatially uniformly excited piezoelectric actuator. The main aim of this work is to examine the performance of a nondiffracting and self-reconstructing zero-order Bessel beam to obtain the full manipulability condition of active carriers in comparison with the case of a plane wave field. The results unveil some unique potentials of the Bessel beams in the company of active carriers, with emphasis on the consumed power of the actuation system.

The important biorecognition elements are enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, DNA sequences, and whole cells. The main readouts are electrochemical (amperometric and voltametric), optical (surface plasmon resonance, colorimetric, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemical, etc.) and piezoelectric. MNPs have received attention for applications in biosensing due to their fascinating properties. These properties include a large surface area that enhances biorecognizers and receptor immobilization, good ability for reaction catalysis and electron transfer, and good biocompatibility. MNPs can be used alone and in combination with other classes of nanostructures. MNP-based sensors can lead to significant signal amplification, higher sensitivity, and great improvements in the detection and quantification of biomolecules and different ions. Some recent examples of biomolecular sensors using MNPs are given, and the effects of structure, shape, and other physical properties of noble MNPs and nanohybrids in biosensor performance are discussed.", "journal": "Nanotechnology reviews", "date": "2018-01-18", "authors": ["HediehMalekzad", "Parham SahandiZangabad", "HamedMirshekari", "MahdiKarimi", "Michael RHamblin"], "doi": "10.1515/ntrev-2016-0014"}

{"title": "Fabrication and characterization of highly porous barium titanate based scaffold coated by Gel/HA nanocomposite with high piezoelectric coefficient for bone tissue engineering applications.", "abstract": "It is well established that the piezoelectric effect plays an important physiological role in bone growth, remodeling and fracture healing. Barium titanate, as a well-known piezoelectric ceramic, is especially an attractive material as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications. In this regard, we tried to fabricate a highly porous barium titanate based scaffolds by foam replication method and polarize them by applying an external electric field. In order to enhance the mechanical and biological properties, polarized/non-polarized scaffolds were coated with gelatin and nanostructured HA and characterized for their morphologies, porosities, piezoelectric and mechanical properties. The results showed that the compressive strength and piezoelectric coefficient of porous scaffolds increased with the increase of sintering temperature. After being coated with Gel/HA nanocomposite, the interconnected porous structure and pore size of the scaffolds almost remain unchanged while the Gel/nHA-coated scaffolds exhibited enhanced compressive strength and elastic modulus compared with the uncoated samples. Also, the effect of polarizing and coating of optimal scaffolds on adhesion, viability, and proliferation of the MG63 osteoblast-like cell line was evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and MTT assay. The cell culture experiments revealed that developed scaffolds had good biocompatibility and cells were able to adhere, proliferate and migrate into pores of the scaffolds. Furthermore, cell density was significantly higher in the coated scaffolds at all tested time-points. These results indicated that highly porous barium titanate scaffolds coated with Gel/HA nanocomposite has great potential in tissue engineering applications for bone tissue repair and regeneration.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2018-01-07", "authors": ["ArianEhterami", "MansureKazemi", "BaharehNazari", "PayamSaraeian", "MahmoudAzami"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.12.034"}
{"title": "Polyvinylidene Fluoride Alters Inflammatory Responses by Activation-induced Cell Death in Macrophages.", "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanomaterials that have been employed in generating diverse materials. We previously reported that CNTs induce cell death in macrophages, possibly via asbestosis. Therefore, we generated CNT-attached polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which is an established polymer in membrane technology, and then examined whether CNT-attached PVDF is immunologically safe for medical purposes compared to CNT alone. To test this, we treated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (RAW cells) with CNT-attached PVDF and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent proinflammatory mediator, in these cells. RAW cells treated with CNT-attached PVDF showed reduced NO production in response to lipopolysaccharide. However, the same treatment also decreased the cell number suggesting that this treatment can alter the homeostasis of RAW cells. Although cell cycle of RAW cells was increased by PVDF treatment with or without CNTs, apoptosis was enhanced in these cells. Taken together, these results indicate that PVDF with or without CNTs modulates inflammatory responses possibly due to activation-induced cell death in macrophages.", "journal": "Immune network", "date": "2018-01-06", "authors": ["Hyun GyungKim", "Sang HoonKim", "Taek-SeungKim", "Tae WonPark", "RanWon", "Hee-DeungPark", "Soo AnChoi", "Yong WooJung"], "doi": "10.4110/in.2017.17.6.402"}
{"title": "Ultrasonic Electric Scalpels Based on a Sliding-Mode Controller With an Auxiliary PLL Frequency Discriminator.", "abstract": "The first monolithic state-of-the-art controller was proposed and implemented for an electric scalpel system. A piezoelectric transducer (PT) is driven in ultrasonic resonant frequency to generate electromechanical power for thermal sealing and cold dissection operations. The band-pass filter based oscillator was developed to automatically track the PT's optimal longitudinal resonance. However, under heavy loading conditions, the PT will lock to other unwanted transverse resonant modes and deliver no usable power to the surgical tip. To prevent this abnormal operation, a phase-locked loop based frequency discriminator with intervention and release logic was developed to ensure that the PT always operates at the proper frequency of 55.5\u00a0kHz. Another crucial challenge is that the changing of loading conditions induces a motional current sensing mismatch and a pole-zero pair, consequently causing instability and poor response time. Therefore, a sliding mode control method with reduced-order sensing was proposed to handle the extreme load changes and provide a fast power build-up time of 9.2 ms, which is 8% faster than previously reported designs and 49% faster than the best commercial product.

We studied suspended, ultrathin 2H-NbSe_{2} devices fabricated on piezoelectric substrates-with tunable flakes thickness, disorder level, and strain. We find a surprising evolution of the conductance fluctuation spectra across the CDW temperature: the conductance fluctuates between two precise values, separated by a quantum of conductance. These quantized fluctuations disappear for disordered and on-substrate devices. With the help of mean-field calculations, these observations can be explained as to arise from dynamical phase transition between the two CDW states.

Hence, constructing porous and gradient-structured composite membranes by integrating robust hydrophobic/lipophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and breathable polyurethane (PU) microporous membranes could help realize a selective separation process.\nHere, novel polyvinylidene fluoride-carbon nanotube/polyurethane/polyvinylidene fluoride-carbon nanotube (PVDF-CNT/PU/PVDF-CNT) sandwich-structured microporous membranes were fabricated by sequential electrospinning. The influence of the thickness ratios of PVDF/PU/PVDF and carbon nanotube (CNT) content on the fibrous construction, porous structure, and wettability of the composite membranes was systematically studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pore size, porosity and contact angle. Significantly, the effect of the fibrous construction, porous structure, and wettability on the waterproofness, breathability, and oil-water separation ability of the composite membranes was investigated.\nThe novel separation system proved the 'complementary effect' between the PVDF and PU membranes. Further, because of the elaborate gradient construction, superior porous structure, and robust hydrophobicity-oleophilicity, the resultant membranes exhibited moderate waterproofness (38\u202fkPa) and excellent breathability (8.63\u202fkg\u202fm", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2017-12-27", "authors": ["JiataiGu", "HaihongGu", "QiongZhang", "YonghuanZhao", "NiLi", "JieXiong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2017.12.032"}

This technical note illustrates an alternative intracranial approach that was used in combination with the techniques of piezoelectric surgery, neuroendoscopy, and neuronavigation for safe and effective removal in a difficult pediatric case of recurrent PBC. The third recurrence of a PBC in a 14-year-old girl was diagnosed by CT and MRI. A retrosigmoid approach gave access to the petrous apex, allowing for the safe and complete removal of the lesion and decompression of the facial nerve and internal carotid artery. The intraoperative implementation of piezoelectric surgery, neuronavigation, neuroendoscopy, and neuromonitoring ensured better intraoperative visualization, safer bone removal, and preservation of nerve function, facilitating a macroscopically total resection of the pathology without additional neurological damage of the adjacent tissues. Cholesteatoma extension could be clearly verified by intraoperative neuronavigation. Neuroendoscopy and piezoelectric surgery provided good support in the safe bone removal in close vicinity to neurovascular structures and in full vision inside the cholesteatoma cavity beyond the line of sight of the microscope.

Using this system, we found that the promotion of osteogenic differentiation by HP is depend on bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression regulated by Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (PIEZO1) in MSCs. The PIEZO1 was expressed and induced after HP loading in primary MSCs and MSC lines, UE7T-13 and SDP11. HP and Yoda1, an activator of PIEZO1, promoted BMP2 expression and osteoblast differentiation, whereas inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Conversely, PIEZO1 inhibition reduced osteoblast differentiation and BMP2 expression. Furthermore, Blocking of BMP2 function by noggin inhibits HP induced osteogenic maker genes expression. In addition, in an in vivo model of medaka with HP loading, HP promoted caudal fin ray development whereas inhibition of piezo1 using GsMTx4 suppressed its development.

Results of XRD characterization showed that the typical \u03b2-PVDF was enhanced as PVDF content ratio increased. SEM results indicated that the catalyst layer easily peeled off due to the low binder concentration of binder, but the high binder content was deemed undesirable because the large amount of non-conductive PVDF interrupted the percolation path. The optimum binder concentration was double checked using Tafel and EIS tests. Results indicated that the cathode with 10% PVDF is the optimum operated concentration. The cathode can obtain 180mV of cathode potential and the smallest total impedance of 2500\u03a9, which are consistent with the SEM analysis.

{"title": "Assessing Infant Carriage Systems: Ground Reaction Force Implications for Gait of the Caregiver.", "abstract": "Objective To assess the acute alterations of anterior infant carriage systems on the ground reaction force experienced during over-ground walking. Background Previous research has identified the alterations in posture and gait associated with an increased anterior load (external or internal); however, the forces applied to the system due to the altered posture during over-ground walking have not been established. Method Thirteen mixed gender participants completed 45 over-ground walking trials at a self-selected pace under three loaded conditions (unloaded, semi-structured carrier 9.9 kg, and structured carrier 9.9 kg). Each trial consisted of a 15-m walkway, centered around a piezoelectric force platform sampling at 1,200 Hz. Differences were assessed between loaded and unloaded conditions and across carriers using paired samples t tests and repeated measures ANOVA. Results Additional load increased all ground reaction force parameters; however, the magnitude of force changes was influenced by carrier structure. The structured carrier displayed increased force magnitudes, a reduction in the time to vertical maximum heel contact, and an increased duration of the flat foot phase in walking gait. Conclusion Evidence suggests that the acute application of anterior infant carriers alters both kinetic and temporal measures of walking gait. Importantly, these changes appear to be governed not solely by the additional mass but also by the structure of the carrier.

The large-scale fractal poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) micro/nanofibers are fabricated by combination of helix electrohydrodynamic printing (HE-Printing) and buckling-driven self-assembly.

The piezoresponse is associated to the localized plasmons that serve as efficient nanoheaters leading to self-regulated strain via thermal expansion of the electroactive polymer.

{"title": "Electricity on Rubber Surfaces: A New Energy Conversion Effect.", "abstract": "This work describes the conversion of mechanical energy to electricity, by periodically stretching rubber tubing and allowing it to relax. The rubber surface shows periodic and reversible electrostatic potential variations, in phase with the tubing length. The potential change depends on the elastomer used: silicone loses charge when stretched and becomes strongly negative when relaxed, whereas the stretched natural rubber is positive, becoming negative when relaxed. Every other elastomeric material that was tested also showed periodic potential but followed different patterns. When the motion stops, the potential on the resting samples decreases quickly to zero. The potential oscillation amplitude decreases when the relative humidity decreases from 65 to 27%, but it is negligible when the rubber tubing is previously swollen with water or paraffin oil. Elastomer charging patterns do not present the well-known characteristics of piezo-, flexo-, or triboelectricity, and they are discussed considering rubber rheology, wear, and surface properties, including the possibility of surface piezoelectricity.

The design goal is to increase the amplitudes of higher-order vibration modes induced during the vibro-impact response of the piezoelectric transducer, thereby providing a means to improve the energy conversion efficiency and power output. A rational configuration of the energy harvester is proposed and it is demonstrated that the new design retains essential modal characteristics of the optimal microcantilever structures, further providing the added benefit of less costly fabrication. The effects of structural dynamics associated with advantageous exploitation of higher vibration modes are analyzed experimentally by means of laser vibrometry as well as numerically via transient simulations of microcantilever response to random excitation. Electrical characterization results indicate that the proposed harvester outperforms its conventional counterpart (based on the microcantilever of the constant cross-section) in terms of generated electrical output.

The best understood mechanosensitive channel, MscL, opens a wide pore, which accounts for mechanosensitive gating due to in-plane area expansion. Eukaryotic Piezo channels have a narrow pore and therefore must capture mechanical forces to control gating in another way. We present a cryo-EM structure of mouse Piezo1 in a closed conformation at 3.7\u00c5-resolution. The channel is a triskelion with arms consisting of repeated arrays of 4-TM structural units surrounding a pore. Its shape deforms the membrane locally into a dome. We present a hypothesis in which the membrane deformation changes upon channel opening. Quantitatively, membrane tension will alter gating energetics in proportion to the change in projected area under the dome.

{"title": "Designing flexible 2D transition metal carbides with strain-controllable lithium storage.", "abstract": "Efficient flexible energy storage systems have received tremendous attention due to their enormous potential applications in self-powering portable electronic devices, including roll-up displays, electronic paper, and \"smart\" garments outfitted with piezoelectric patches to harvest energy from body movement. Unfortunately, the further development of these technologies faces great challenges due to a lack of ideal electrode materials with the right electrochemical behavior and mechanical properties. MXenes, which exhibit outstanding mechanical properties, hydrophilic surfaces, and high conductivities, have been identified as promising electrode material candidates. In this work, taking 2D transition metal carbides (TMCs) as representatives, we systematically explored several influencing factors, including transition metal species, layer thickness, functional group, and strain on their mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness, flexibility, and strength) and their electrochemical properties (e.g., ionic mobility, equilibrium voltage, and theoretical capacity). Considering potential charge-transfer polarization, we employed a charged electrode model to simulate ionic mobility and found that ionic mobility has a unique dependence on the surface atomic configuration influenced by bond length, valence electron number, functional groups, and strain. Under multiaxial loadings, electrical conductivity, high ionic mobility, low equilibrium voltage with good stability, excellent flexibility, and high theoretical capacity indicate that the bare 2D TMCs have potential to be ideal flexible anode materials, whereas the surface functionalization degrades the transport mobility and increases the equilibrium voltage due to bonding between the nonmetals and Li.

The size and morphology of the resultant polymer microspheres have been investigated by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Apart from the elimination of the use of highly toxic solvents as in conventional methods for manufacturing of polymer microspheres, the newly developed technique has the advantages of providing faster desolvation of the polymer solution droplets and a higher yield of microspheres compared to emulsification-based techniques.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2017-12-12", "authors": ["YanlinZhang", "Robert WCattrall", "Spas DKolev"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b03574"}

{"title": "Parametric analysis of electromechanical and fatigue performance of total knee replacement bearing with embedded piezoelectric transducers.", "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common procedure in the United States; it has been estimated that about 4 million people are currently living with primary knee replacement in this country. Despite huge improvements in material properties, implant design, and surgical techniques, some implants fail a few years after surgery. A lack of information about in vivo kinetics of the knee prevents the establishment of a correlated intra- and postoperative loading pattern in knee implants. In this study, a conceptual design of an ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) knee bearing with embedded piezoelectric transducers is proposed, which is able to measure the reaction forces from knee motion as well as harvest energy to power embedded electronics. A simplified geometry consisting of a disk of UHMW with a single embedded piezoelectric ceramic is used in this work to study the general parametric trends of an instrumented knee bearing. A combined finite element and electromechanical modeling framework is employed to investigate the fatigue behavior of the instrumented bearing and the electromechanical performance of the embedded piezoelectric. The model is validated through experimental testing and utilized for further parametric studies. Parametric studies consist of the investigation of the effects of several dimensional and piezoelectric material parameters on the durability of the bearing and electrical output of the transducers. Among all the parameters, it is shown that adding large fillet radii results in noticeable improvement in the fatigue life of the bearing. Additionally, the design is highly sensitive to the depth of piezoelectric pocket. Finally, using PZT-5H piezoceramics, higher voltage and slightly enhanced fatigue life is achieved.", "journal": "Smart materials & structures", "date": "2017-12-12", "authors": ["MohsenSafaei", "R MichaelMeneghini", "Steven RAnton"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-665X/aa814e"}

The highly symmetric cubic crystal structure of plastic crystals endows these materials with multiaxial ferroelectricity that allows a three-dimensional realignment of the polarization axes of the crystals, which cannot be achieved using conventional molecular ferroelectric crystals with low crystal symmetry. In this work, we focused our attention on malleability as another characteristic feature of plastic crystals. We have synthesized the new plastic/ferroelectric ionic crystals tetramethylammonium tetrachloroferrate(III) and tetramethylammonium bromotrichloroferrate(III), and discovered that free-standing translucent films can be easily prepared by pressing powdered samples of these compounds. The thus obtained polycrystalline films exhibit ferroelectric polarization switching and a relatively large piezoelectric response at room temperature.

Such piezoelectrics are thought to be rare, but there is no fundamental physics preventing the realization of negative longitudinal piezoelectric effect in a single-phase material. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that several hexagonal ABC ferroelectrics possess significant negative longitudinal piezoelectric effects. The data mining of a first-principles-based database of piezoelectrics reveals that this effect is a general phenomenon. The origin of this unusual piezoelectric response relies on the strong ionic bonds associated with small effective charges and rigid potential energy surfaces.

These distinctive features are discovered from the analyses of neutron pair distribution functions and Raman scattering data at ambient conditions, which are particularly sensitive to mesoscopic-scale structural correlations.

To reveal the piezoelectric property of ZnO nanohelices, the piezoelectric potential in single-crystal nanohelices was simulated by finite element method calculations. For a nanohelix with a length of 1200 nm, a mean coil radius of 150 nm, five active coils, and a hexagonal coiled wire with a side length 100 nm, a compressing force of 100 nN results in a potential of 1.85 V. This potential is significantly higher than the potential produced in a straight nanowire with the same length and applied force. Maintaining the length and increasing the number of coils or mean coil radius leads to higher piezoelectric potential in the nanohelix. Appling a force along the axial direction produces higher piezoelectric potential than in other directions. Adding lateral forces to an existing axial force can change the piezoelectric potential distribution in the nanohelix, while the maximum piezoelectric potential remains largely unchanged in some cases.

It is possible to alleviate this effect if the local electrostatic fields and band alignment induced charge redistribution can be quantitatively determined across the heterostructures. In this Concept, the applications of electron holography to investigate semiconductor LEDs are summarized.

Moreover, GaAs-based LED heterostructures are briefly discussed.

To improve these models, relying on comprehensive and accurate field data is essential. While sea ice extent and concentration are accurately monitored from microwave imagery, an accurate measure of its thickness is still lacking. Moreover, measuring observables related to the mechanical behavior of the ice (such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.) could provide better insights in the understanding of sea ice decline, by completing current knowledge so far acquired mostly from radar and sonar data. This paper aims at demonstrating on the laboratory scale that these can all be estimated simultaneously by measuring seismic waves guided in the ice layer.

The proposed MIPI model is composed of a P-I model and a dynamic model which are connected in parallel. The proposed hysteresis model has the advantage of high modeling accuracy with a concise identification process, which means the step by step identification is not needed here. Experiments on grasping force hysteresis compensation with a feedforward controller are carried out based on the developed MIPI model. The grasping force error in steady state lies in \u00b18.17 mN, while the maximum percentage and root mean square percentage of the grasping force error are 2.93% and 0.92%, respectively. The results show that the proposed hysteresis model is efficient and the wire clamp exhibits good performance with the feedforward controller.

Statistical comparisons were made using a paired t test and a two-sample t test (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.05).\nUltrasonic scaling did not alter microleakage at the margins of crowns (P\u00a0=\u00a0.31). There was no significant difference in microleakage of scaled and untreated margins with the use of different cements (P\u00a0=\u00a0.21). The amount of microleakage around margins that were scaled was not significantly different between cements (P\u00a0=\u00a0.14). Untreated margins of crowns cemented with RelyX Luting Plus showed a significantly higher microleakage than those cemented with RelyX Unicem 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005).\nPiezoelectric ultrasonic scaling did not increase microleakage at the margin of zirconia crowns cemented with self-adhesive resin or RMGI cements.\nPiezoelectric ultrasonic scaling around zirconia crowns did not impact marginal microleakage cemented with self-adhesive resin or RMGI cements.", "journal": "Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ...

{"title": "Numerical and Experimental Evaluation of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound-Induced Lesions in Liver Tissue Ex Vivo.", "abstract": "Recent advances in the field of acoustics and piezoelectric and ultrasound transducers have led to new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases. One method of treatment with ultrasonic waves is high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment, which is a thermal therapeutic method used to treat malignant tumors. Although a variety of treatment-planning strategies using ultrasonic waves have been investigated, little clinical success has been achieved. Computational modeling is a powerful tool for predicting device performance.\nThe heating induced by a concave transducer with operating powers of 85 and 135 W was studied, and the experimental results presented in this article verify its applicability. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear acoustic field were performed by using the Westervelt and Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equations. Heat transfer was measured for the 2 operational powers, and the results were compared with ex vivo experimental results. In addition, thermal dose contours for both the simulation and experimental results were calculated to investigate the ablated area.\nGood agreement was found between the experimental and numerical results. The results show that the average temperature deviations calculated at the focal point were 12.8% and 4.3% for transducer powers of 85 and 135 W, respectively.\nThis study provides guidance to HIFU practitioners in determining lesion size and identifying nonlinear effects that should be considered in HIFU procedures.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2017-12-02", "authors": ["SamanehHaddadi", "Mohammad TaghiAhmadian"], "doi": "10.1002/jum.14491"}
{"title": "Mapping piezoelectric response in nanomaterials using a dedicated non-destructive scanning probe technique.", "abstract": "There has been tremendous interest in piezoelectricity at the nanoscale, for example in nanowires and nanofibers where piezoelectric properties may be enhanced or controllably tuned, thus necessitating robust characterization techniques of piezoelectric response in nanomaterials. Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) is a well-established scanning probe technique routinely used to image piezoelectric/ferroelectric domains in thin films, however, its applicability to nanoscale objects is limited due to the requirement for physical contact with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip that may cause dislocation or damage, particularly to soft materials, during scanning. Here we report a non-destructive PFM (ND-PFM) technique wherein the tip is oscillated into \"discontinuous\" contact during scanning, while applying an AC bias between tip and sample and extracting the piezoelectric response for each contact point by monitoring the resulting localized deformation at the AC frequency. ND-PFM is successfully applied to soft polymeric (poly-l-lactic acid) nanowires, as well as hard ceramic (barium zirconate titanate-barium calcium titanate) nanowires, both previously inaccessible by conventional PFM. Our ND-PFM technique is versatile and compatible with commercial AFMs, and can be used to correlate piezoelectric properties of nanomaterials with their microstructural features thus overcoming key characterisation challenges in the field.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2017-12-02", "authors": ["YonatanCalahorra", "MichaelSmith", "AnujaDatta", "HadasBenisty", "SohiniKar-Narayan"], "doi": "10.1039/c7nr06714c"}

Therefore, the development and critical evaluation of cleaning procedures for each material system that is under consideration becomes crucial. Contaminants like particles or the presence of organic/inorganic material on the substrate can dramatically influence and alter the properties of the thin film substrate composite, such as wettability, film adhesion, film texture, and so on. In this article, focus is given to different cleaning processes like SC-1 and SC-2, UV-ozone treatment, as well as cleaning by first-contact polymer Opticlean, which are applied for removal of contaminants from the piezoelectric substrate Ca 3 TaGa 3 Si 2 O 14 . By means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the presence of the most critical contaminants such as carbon, sodium, and iron removed through different cleaning procedures were studied and significant differences were observed between the outcomes of these procedures. Based on these results, a two-step cleaning process, combining SC-1 at a reduced temperature at 30 \u2218 C instead of 80 \u2218 C and a subsequent UV-ozone cleaning directly prior to deposition of the metallization, is suggested to achieve the lowest residual contamination level.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-12-01", "authors": ["ErikBrachmann", "MariettaSeifert", "SteffenOswald", "Siegfried BMenzel", "ThomasGemming"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10121373\n10.1116/1.573115\n10.1002/pssa.2211150124\n10.1063/1.99269\n10.1063/1.3142429\n10.1063/1.3592347\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.3052\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.12.185\n10.1016/j.mseb.2015.08.007"}

Upon activation by mechanical stimuli, Piezo channels rapidly inactivate in a voltage-dependent manner through an\u00a0unknown mechanism.

This study relied on laser interferometry for the base displacement measurement of bar waves, from which eight different guided wave test set-ups are developed with known wave motion using piezoelectric transmitters. Both plates and bars of 12.7 and 6.4 mm thickness were used as wave propagation media. The upper frequency limit was 2 MHz. Output of guided wave detectors were obtained on the test set-ups and their receiving sensitivities were characterized and averaged. While each sensitivity spectrum was noisy for a detector, the averaged spectrum showed a good convergence to a unique receiving sensitivity. Twelve detectors were evaluated and their sensitivity spectra determined in absolute units. Generally, these showed rapidly dropping sensitivity with increasing frequency due to waveform cancellation on their sensing areas.

With little and inconsistent information in the literature regarding their efficiency for preparing implant osteotomies, the objective of this systematic review was to compare the use of CDs to PEDs for ISP with regard to implant stability values, marginal bone level changes, operating time, and dental implant failure rate.\nThe systematic review was prepared according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The literature was searched for studies that assessed the use of CDs and PEDs for ISP. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the selected studies and meta-analyses were performed using statistical software.\nA total of 755 citations were identified. Of these, 4 studies with 178 implant osteotomies in 80 participants were included. The pooled estimates for the implant stability showed significant differences between the 2 surgical techniques in favor of PEDs at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks. A statistically significant difference in the operating time was also shown between the 2 techniques with more time required using PED. The differences in marginal bone level changes or implant failure rate were not statistically significant.\nWith the limitations of this review in mind, PEDs appear to be a viable alternative to traditional drilling techniques for ISP. With the exception of prolonged operating time associated with the use of PEDs, both techniques were comparable in terms of the marginal bone level changes and the risk of implant failure. The favorable influence of the implant stability pattern related to the use of PEDs on the predictability of immediate and early loading protocols need to be confirmed in future studies.", "journal": "Clinical implant dentistry and related research", "date": "2017-11-18", "authors": ["Momen AAtieh", "Nabeel H MAlsabeeha", "AndrewTawse-Smith", "Warwick JDuncan"], "doi": "10.1111/cid.12555"}

Certain dual-frequency configurations produced up to a threefold increase in sonochemical efficiency, while others yeilded no improvement over a single frequency. These results led to two significant findings. First, phase-shift had a strong effect on sonochemical efficiency for both harmonic and non-harmonic frequency combinations. Second, the most efficient dual-harmonic-frequency waveforms had a single peak per half-cycle, rather than two unique peaks.

{"title": "Characterization and Antibiofouling Performance Investigation of Hydrophobic Silver Nanocomposite Membranes: A Comparative Study.", "abstract": "Biofouling is one of the drawbacks restricting the industrial applications of membranes. In this study, different thicknesses of silver nanoparticles with proper adhesion were deposited on poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF) and polyethersulfone (PES) surfaces by physical vapor deposition (PVD). The crystalline and structural properties of modified and pure membranes were investigated by carrying out X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were employed to examine the surface morphology and the bacteria anti-adhesion property of the membranes. The morphology measurements confirmed that even though after silver grafting the surface became more hydrophobic, the homogeneity increased and the flux reduction decreased after coating. Moreover a comparison between PVDF and PES revealed that CFU (colony forming units) reduced 64.5% on PVDF surface and 31.1% on PES surface after modification.

Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) culture supports were prepared with structures ranging between 2D and 3D, based on PVDF films on which PVDF microspheres were deposited with varying surface density. Maintenance of multipotentiality when cultured in expansion medium was studied by flow cytometry monitoring the expression of characteristic hMSCs markers, and revealed that cells were losing their characteristic surface markers on these supports. Cell morphology was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Alkaline phosphatase activity was also assessed after seven days of culture on expansion medium. On the other hand, osteoblastic differentiation was monitored while culturing in osteogenic medium after cells reached confluence. Osteocalcin immunocytochemistry and alizarin red assays were performed. We show that flow cytometry is a suitable technique for the study of the differentiation of hMSC seeded onto biomaterials, giving a quantitative reliable analysis of hMSC-associated markers. We also show that electrosprayed piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) is a suitable support for tissue engineering purposes, as hMSCs can proliferate, be viable and undergo osteogenic differentiation when chemically stimulated.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2017-11-16", "authors": ["RSobreiro-Almeida", "M NTama\u00f1o-Machiavello", "E OCarvalho", "LCord\u00f3n", "SDoria", "LSenent", "D MCorreia", "CRibeiro", "SLanceros-M\u00e9ndez", "RSabater I Serra", "J LGomez Ribelles", "ASempere"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms18112391\n10.1002/jctb.1901\n10.1038/nrm3049\n10.3727/096368910X532756\n10.1042/BSR20150025\n10.1039/C5IB00177C\n10.1038/nrd1088\n10.1016/j.actbio.2009.07.023\n10.1002/smll.201000233\n10.1007/s10856-007-3195-2\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.12.006\n10.1089/ten.teb.2011.0184\n10.1039/c2ra21841k\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.08.043\n10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.12.055\n10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.07.006\n10.1088/1748-6041/7/3/035004\n10.1088/1748-6041/8/4/045007\n10.1002/jbm.a.35368\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.587-588.72\n10.1002/jbm.a.35234\n10.1182/blood-2006-08-039347\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0342\n10.1182/blood-2007-07-099622\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.118\n10.1039/C4RA04581E\n10.1007/s10856-012-4808-y\n10.1097/BCO.0b013e3282630851\n10.1002/jbm.a.30411\n10.1006/cbir.1994.1088\n10.1088/1758-5082/5/2/025007\n10.1038/nmat2013\n10.1073/pnas.0903269107\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044\n10.1016/S1534-5807(04)00075-9\n10.1186/1746-160X-2-8\n10.1002/jcp.23001\n10.22203/eCM.v025a03\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243147\n10.1016/j.ab.2004.02.002"}

The key enabling feature is the serrated teeth along the edges across an inclined gap as a part of the conductive collector. As a result, the electrical field across the gap is shaped to direct the electrospun fibers to merge into multiple bundles. The sharp points on the serrated teeth provide favorable charge dissipation points and thus fibers are preferentially formed bridging two closest sharp points across the gap. To investigate the effectiveness of serrated teeth on the formation of multiple fiber bundles, three-dimensional finite element simulations are conducted. The corresponding collectors are implemented to experimentally study the resulting electrospun fibers. Both simulation and experimental results suggest that multiple fiber bundles can be formed under the condition of a low teeth pitch to gap distance ratio. Furthermore, a sharper tooth angle results in a higher preferential formation of fiber bundles. Finally, the total electrospinning time should be less than 60\u2009seconds to maintain favorable electric field profile. We also demonstrate that these piezoelectric fiber bundles can serve as ultra-flexible textile sensors.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-11-15", "authors": ["Yu-HsiangHsu", "Chen-HaoChan", "William CTang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-15698-7\n10.1038/ncomms7205\n10.1039/C5TB00472A\n10.1002/adfm.201502142\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.09.014\n10.1039/c3tb20795a\n10.1002/jbm.a.32004\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.003\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.10.061\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/8/085040\n10.1016/S1369-7021(06)71389-X\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2010.01.004\n10.1016/j.matdes.2006.12.013\n10.1088/0957-4484/12/3/329\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.03.013\n10.1002/app.23762\n10.1002/app.36519\n10.1021/nl0486158\n10.1021/nl0344256\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.11.045\n10.1002/app.33395\n10.1021/nn101554u\n10.1002/jbm.a.35208\n10.1021/nl0504235\n10.1002/adma.200700171\n10.3390/s140711957"}

The wavelength of the quantum dot emission shows butterfly-like loops, from which the coercive fields are directly derived. The results suggest that coercive fields at cryogenic temperatures are strongly increased, yielding values several tens of times larger than those at room temperature.

ZnO is one of the most investigated metal oxides, thanks to its multifunctional properties coupled with the ease of preparing various morphologies, such as nanowires, nanorods, and nanoparticles.

However, several works have highlighted that ZnO nanostructures may successfully promote the growth, proliferation and differentiation of several cell lines, in combination with the rise of promising antibacterial activities. In particular, osteogenesis and angiogenesis have been effectively demonstrated in numerous cases.

The SA layer is hydrophilic in structure and is capable of strong interaction with water molecules, thus presenting high sensitivity to humidity, whereas the PVDF layer is hydrophobic, inert to humidity. This structural feature results in the bilayer having asymmetric humidity-responsive performances that can thus make its shape change with directionality, which cannot be achieved in an SA single layer. The responsive process to humidity can be adjusted by exposure of the bilayer to sunlight by means of a photothermal effect that accelerates dehydration of the bilayer to cause more rapid shape deformations. When the sunlight is removed, the bilayer adsorbs humidity again and returns to its original shape, indicating good reversibility.

The nonlinearity parameter was measured using contact piezoelectric transducers, which were calibrated using the reciprocity based technique. Aluminum and steel samples were chosen to study the influence of hardness of the sample on the measurement of the nonlinearity parameter. While, lower Ra value (average asperity height) aluminum samples were more susceptible to surface deformation and scratches from coupling the transducer to the sample, the same could not be observed for steel samples. Results demonstrate a large variation in nonlinearity parameter for aluminum (\u223c35%) compared to steel (\u223c2%) between two consecutive experiments, suggesting flattening of asperities after the first experiment. Experiments were also performed with 3 different setup configurations; (1) receiver and transmitter on rough sides, (2) receiver on smooth and transmitter on rough side and (3) receiver on rough and transmitter on smooth side. Results show that least variation in the measured nonlinearity parameter was observed when the receiver was placed on the smooth side, and a 10% variation was observed between the three setup configurations. Finally, a comparison of relative nonlinearity parameter calculated using current or voltage ratio and absolute nonlinearity parameter showed large discrepancies.

{"title": "Concept and Evaluation of a New Piezoelectric Transducer for an Implantable Middle Ear Hearing Device.", "abstract": "Implantable middle ear hearing devices (IMEHDs) have been developed as a new technology to overcome the limitations of conventional hearing aids. The piezoelectric cantilever transducers currently used in the IMEHDs have the advantages of low power consumption and ease of fabrication, but generate less high-frequency output. To address this problem, we proposed and designed a new piezoelectric transducer based on a piezoelectric stack for the IMEHD. This new transducer, attached to the incus body with a coupling rod, stimulates the ossicular chain in response to the expansion-and-contraction of its piezoelectric stack. To test its feasibility for hearing loss compensation, a bench testing of the transducer prototype and a temporal bone experiment were conducted, respectively. Bench testing results showed that the new transducer did have a broad frequency bandwidth. Besides, the transducer was found to have a low total harmonic distortion (<0.75%) in all frequencies, and small release time (1 ms).

This property benefits the treatment of the most common sloping high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.

No demodulation devices like spectrometer or Fabry-Perot filter were needed to gain the voltage signal, and a relatively large sensing frequency range was acquired in this paper; thus, the cost of the sensing system is more acceptable in engineering application. The voltage to be measured was directly applied to the piezoelectric ceramic, and deformation of the ceramics and the grating would be caused because of the inverse piezoelectric effect. With a reference grating, the output light intensity change will be caused by the FBG center wavelength change; thus, the relationship between the applied voltage and the output light intensity was established.

Four-channel fPCG sensors made of low cost (<$1) ceramic piezo vibration sensor within 3D-printed casings were used to collect abdominal phonogram signals from 20 pregnant mothers (>34 weeks of gestation). A novel multi-lag covariance matrix-based eigenvalue decomposition technique was used to separate maternal breathing, fetal heart sounds (fHS) and maternal heart sounds (mHS) from abdominal phonogram signals. Prior to the fHR estimation, the fPCG signals were denoised using a multi-resolution wavelet-based filter. The proposed source separation technique was first tested in separating sources from synthetically mixed signals and then on raw abdominal phonogram signals. fHR signals extracted from fPCG signals were validated using simultaneous recorded CTG-based fHR recordings.The experimental results have shown that the fHR derived from the acquired fPCG can be used to detect periods of acceleration and deceleration, which are critical indication of the fetus' well-being.

Although researchers have proposed control algorithms with dual-axis control inputs to improve gyroscope performance, most have verified the control algorithms through numerical simulations because they lacked practical devices with dual-axis control inputs. The aim of this study was to design a piezoelectric gyroscope equipped with a dual-axis control input so that researchers may experimentally verify those control algorithms in future. Designing a piezoelectric gyroscope with a dual-axis control input is more difficult than designing a conventional gyroscope because the control input must be effective over a broad frequency range to compensate for imperfections, and the multiple mode shapes in flexural deformations complicate the relation between flexural deformation and the proof mass position. This study solved these problems by using a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) material, introducing additional electrodes for shielding, developing an optimal electrode pattern, and performing calibrations of undesired couplings. The results indicated that the fabricated device could be operated at 5.5\u00b11 kHz to perform dual-axis actuations and position measurements. The calibration of the fabricated device was completed by system identifications of a new dynamic model including gyroscopic motions, electromechanical coupling, mechanical coupling, electrostatic coupling, and capacitive output impedance.

A combination of steady state and transient features of the sensor signals showed superior performances with LDA and MLPNN. Although MLPNN gave excellent results reaching 100% recognition rate at 400 s, over all time stations PNN gave the best performance based on an expanded data-set with adjacent neighbours. In this case, 100% of the pheromone mixtures were successfully identified just 200 s after they were first injected into the wind tunnel. We believe that this approach can be used for future chemical communication employing simple mixtures of airborne molecules.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-10-31", "authors": ["GuangfenWei", "SanjuThomas", "MarinaCole", "Zolt\u00e1nR\u00e1cz", "Julian WGardner"], "doi": "10.3390/s17112489\n10.1016/j.neuron.2011.11.003\n10.1016/j.neuron.2013.08.026\n10.1002/cta.1829\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002115\n10.1111/j.1570-7458.1990.tb01331.x\n10.1088/1748-3190/10/4/043001\n10.1016/S0039-9140(00)00401-X\n10.1016/0022-1910(93)90096-A\n10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.043\n10.1109/ICSENS.2012.6411357\n10.1109/ICSENS.2011.6127377\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2512303\n10.1111/j.1365-3032.2008.00645.x\n10.1063/1.3608138\n10.1109/JSEN.2012.2192920\n10.1109/TCBB.2013.101\n10.1109/JSEN.2004.827207\n10.1049/ip-smt:20045011\n10.1109/JSEN.2002.800688\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2326693\n10.1109/ICSENS.2005.1597877\n10.1109/CACSD.2010.5612649"}

Two different processing routes are tested. Firstly a conventional dielectrophoretic structuring is used to induce a chain-like particle configuration, followed by curing the matrix and poling at a high temperature and under a high voltage. Secondly a simultaneous combination of dielectrophoresis and poling is applied at room temperature while the polymer is in the liquid state followed by subsequent curing. This new processing route is practiced in an uncured thermoset system while the polymer matrix still possess a relatively high electrical conductivity. Composites with different degrees of alignment are produced by altering the magnitude of the applied electric field. A significant improvement in piezoelectric properties of quasi 1-3 composites can be achieved by a combination of dielectrophoretic alignment of the ceramic particles and poling process. It has been observed that the degree of structuring as well as the functional properties of the in-situ structured and poled composites enhance significantly compared to those of the conventionally manufactured structured composites.

In an AFM, interaction forces are measured by reflecting a laser beam off a cantilever onto a position sensitive detector and monitoring cantilever deflection. Precise measurements of interaction forces rely on accurately determining the optical lever sensitivity, i.e., the relationship between cantilever deflection and changes in detector voltage. The optical lever sensitivity is measured by pressing the cantilever against a hard substrate using a piezoactuator and recording the resulting change in detector voltage. However, nonlinearities in the motion of commonly used open-loop piezo actuators introduce significant errors in measured optical lever sensitivities.

The diacetylene monomers are self-assembled during the electrospinning process. The PDA-embedded PVDF nanofibers in the blue phase are obtained via photo-polymerization upon UV-light irradiation. The colorimetric transition of the nanofibers is studied as a function of temperature using a spectrophotometer. The morphology and crystal polymorphism of the nanofibers are investigated. The results show that the addition of PDA increases the diameter of the nanofibers due to the increase in the electrospinning solution viscosity. The results of Fourier transform infrared and wide angle X-ray diffraction demonstrate that PDA has the effect of inhibiting the growth of non-polar \u03b1-phase crystals, while promoting the growth of the polar \u03b2-phase. However, the red phase of PDA-embedded PVDF exhibits a lower intensity of the \u03b2-phase in comparison to that of the blue phase. In fact, the blue-to-red color transition of the PDA-embedded electrospun PVDF nanofibers is accompanied by the variation of piezoelectric signaling caused by variations in the \u03b2-phase.

{"title": "Activation of Alkaline Irrigation Fluids in Endodontics.", "abstract": "In conventional endodontic treatment, alkaline solutions of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) are used in combination to disinfect the root canal system and to eliminate debris and smear layers. An important concept that has emerged over recent years is the use of active physical methods for agitating these fluids to improve their penetration within areas that are not reached by endodontic instruments and to accelerate the chemical actions of these alkaline fluids against planktonic microorganisms, biofilms, soft tissue remnants and smear layers. Ultrasonic agitation and more recently pulsed lasers have emerged as two promising methods for activating endodontic irrigation fluids. Ultrasonic agitation with piezoelectric devices employs a moving tip, while laser agitation uses a stationary tip. Both methods cause cavitation, followed by implosions and shear forces which assist with debridement. Fluid streaming further enhances the activity of the fluids.

We placed two different membranes (absorbable and nonabsorbable) underneath the periosteum of rat calvaria. We prepared the periosteum using different methods (piezoelectric device vs mechanical device). We then examined and analyzed periosteal microcirculation over a period of 28 days. A clear difference was observed between the two methods when used with absorbable membranes: The piezoelectric device offered advantages. Absorbable membranes maintain considerably more local periosteal microcirculation and should be given preference.

{"title": "Fall detection using smart floor sensor and supervised learning.", "abstract": "Falls are a major risk for elderly people's health and independence. Fast and reliable fall detection systems can improve chances of surviving the accident and coping with its physical and psychological consequences. Recent research has come up with various solutions, all suffering from significant drawbacks, one of them being the intrusiveness into patient's life. This paper proposes a novel fall detection monitoring system based on a sensitive floor sensor made out of a piezoelectric material and a machine learning approach. The detection is done by a combination between a supervised Random Forest and an aggregation of its output over time. The database was made using acquisitions from 28 volunteers simulating falls and other behaviours. Unlike existent fall detection systems, our solution offers the advantages of having a passive sensor (no power supply is needed) and being completely unobtrusive since the sensor comes with the floor. Results are compared with state-of-the-art classification algorithms. On our database, good performance of fall detection was obtained with a True Positive Rate of 94.4% and a False Positive Rate of 2.4%.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We asked five healthy males (21-24 years old) to sit in an arbitrary position on a chair that had eight piezoelectric sensors attached, and heartbeat signals were measured. The experiment consisted of four measurements (5 min measurements after adequate rest), while performing specific body movements at a specific time, with deliberately mixed noise of body movements. To remove body movement noise, bandpass filter processing (4 Hz-20 Hz) was applied to the signal obtained from the piezoelectric sensors, and the heartbeat component was extracted using independent component analysis (number of separations was eight) on the processed waveform. For verification, the error rate was obtained before and after the removal of body movement noise, respectively. The error rate after removal of body motion was 2.91 \u00b1 0.75%. In our previous study with two piezoelectric sensors without body movement, the error rate was 2.47 \u00b1 2.66%.

This paper presents an approach for analyzing the PVDF signal using extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a synthetic model that has previously been used to model the ECG signal with Gaussian functions. Moreover, a novel approach for incorporating state inequality constraints into the EKF process using a gradient projection method is introduced. The taut string algorithm was first used to estimate the outline of the signal and remove it to highlight the reflection waves. Then, the EKF was used to characterize the morphology of the signal using Gaussian functions. The amplitudes of the Gaussian functions were used as features to train a classifier.

However, due to the hysteresis of the piezoelectric ceramic transducer (PZT) actuator in the ECDL, the optical frequency sweeps of the ECDL exhibit different behaviors, depending on whether the frequency is increasing or decreasing. Consequently, the model parameters of Kalman filter appear time varying in each iteration, which produces state estimation errors with time-invariant filtering. To address this, in this paper, a time-varying Kalman filter is proposed to model the instantaneous movement of a target relative to the different optical frequency tuning durations of the ECDL.

The electromechanical coupling factor of such crystals for all main vibration modes such as the thickness extension and transverse extension modes is more than 0.9. Operation of ultrasonic transducers with such piezoelectric elements in transmitting and receiving modes is rather different. Therefore, for transmission and reception of ultrasonic signals, separate piezoelectric elements with different dimensions must be used. The objective of this research was development of novel air-coupled ultrasonic receivers with PMN-32%PT strip-like piezoelectric elements vibrating in a transverse-extension mode with electromechanically controlled operation and suitable for applications in ultrasonic arrays. Performance of piezoelectric receivers made of the PMN-32%PT strip-like elements vibrating in this mode may be efficiently controlled by selecting geometry of the electrodes covering side surfaces of the piezoelectric element. It is equivalent to introduction of electromechanical damping which does not require any additional backing element. For this purpose; we have proposed the continuous electrodes to divide into two pairs of electrodes. The one pair is used to pick up the electric signal; another one is exploited for electromechanical damping. Two types of electrodes may be used-rectangular or non-rectangular-with a gap between them directed at some angle, usually 45\u00b0. The frequency bandwidth is wider (up to 9 kHz) in the case of non-rectangular electrodes. The strip-like acoustic matching element bonded to the tip of the PMN-32%PT crystal may significantly enhance the performance of the ultrasonic receiver. It was proposed to use for this purpose AIREX T10.110 rigid polymer foam, the acoustic impedance of which is close to the optimal value necessary for matching with air. It was found that in order to get a wide bandwidth the length of the matching strip should be selected not a quarter wavelength \u03bb/4 at the antiresonance frequency but at lower frequency.

{"title": "Quantitative comparison of PZT and CMUT probes for photoacoustic imaging: Experimental validation.", "abstract": "Photoacoustic (PA) signals are short ultrasound (US) pulses typically characterized by a single-cycle shape, often referred to as N-shape. The spectral content of such wideband signals ranges from a few hundred kilohertz to several tens of megahertz. Typical reception frequency responses of classical piezoelectric US imaging transducers, based on PZT technology, are not sufficiently broadband to fully preserve the entire information contained in PA signals, which are then filtered, thus limiting PA imaging performance. Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUT) are rapidly emerging as a valid alternative to conventional PZT transducers in several medical ultrasound imaging applications. As compared to PZT transducers, CMUTs exhibit both higher sensitivity and significantly broader frequency response in reception, making their use attractive in PA imaging applications. This paper explores the advantages of the CMUT larger bandwidth in PA imaging by carrying out an experimental comparative study using various CMUT and PZT probes from different research laboratories and manufacturers. PA acquisitions are performed on a suture wire and on several home-made bimodal phantoms with both PZT and CMUT probes. Three criteria, based on the evaluation of pure receive impulse response, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) respectively, have been used for a quantitative comparison of imaging results. The measured fractional bandwidths of the CMUT arrays are larger compared to PZT probes. Moreover, both SNR and CNR are enhanced by at least 6\u00a0dB with CMUT technology.

Two methods for determining the elongation direction of macrozones in titanium alloys, using the anisotropic spatial coherence of the backscattered field, are presented. Both methods use a phased array attached on a rotative holder that records the array response matrix at several angles. Two titanium alloys were investigated: TA6V and Ti17. TA6V exhibited a strong macrozone elongation, whereas Ti17 macrozones were found equiaxial. The first method is based on the measurement of backscattered intensity in function of the probe angle relative to the macrozones elongation direction. An angular dependence of backscattered intensity is observed in presence of elongated scatterers, and their elongation direction is collinear with the probe direction corresponding to a minimal intensity. This variability is linked to both piezoelectric shape and the backscattered field spatial properties. The second method is based on the measurement of the relative proportion of single to multiple scattering in a diffusive media, using a simplified version of the single scattering filter developed in Aubry and Derode (2009). It allows the measurement of the level of multiple scattering: both titanium alloys exhibited strong multiple scattering.

{"title": "Quantifying the dispersion quality of partially aggregated colloidal dispersions by high frequency rheology.", "abstract": "An important parameter for the performance of nanomaterials is the degree by which the nanoparticles are dispersed in a matrix. Optical microscopy or scattering methods are useful to characterise the state of dispersion, but are not generally applicable to all materials. Electron microscopy methods are laborious in preparation and typically offer only quantitative information on a very local scale. In the present work we investigate how high frequency rheological measurements can be used for partially dispersed suspensions at intermediate to higher particle loadings, even for high viscous matrices. Although the contribution of the particles is particularly visible in the low frequency linear viscoelastic behaviour, a more direct relationship between rheological properties and degree of dispersion can be derived from the loss modulus in the high frequency limit. To this end, a home-built piezo shear rheometer is constructed to extend the frequency range typically accessible by commercial rotational rheometers. Measurements on spherical silica particles, with a varying degree of dispersion in low molecular weight PDMS, are used to demonstrate how high frequency rheometry can be used to quantify dispersion quality. The linear viscoelastic properties are compared to analytical scaling theories to demonstrate that a hydrodynamically dominated regime is reached. The dependence of the relative high frequency loss modulus on volume fraction is then compared to predictions of a hydrodynamic viscosity model for the derivation of a dispersion quality index. It is used to follow the evolution of the dispersion quality as a function of mixing time and consumed power.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2017-10-13", "authors": ["BramSchroyen", "James WSwan", "PeterVan Puyvelde", "JanVermant"], "doi": "10.1039/c7sm01690e"}

{"title": "Deciphering the olfactory repertoire of the tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus.", "abstract": "The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive species and competent vector of several arboviruses (e.g. dengue, chikungunya, Zika) and parasites (e.g. dirofilaria) of public health importance. Compared to other mosquito species, Ae. albopictus females exhibit a generalist host seeking as well as a very aggressive biting behaviour that are responsible for its high degree of nuisance. Several complex mosquito behaviours such as host seeking, feeding, mating or oviposition rely on olfactory stimuli that target a range of sensory neurons localized mainly on specialized head appendages such as antennae, maxillary palps and the mouthparts.\nWith the aim to describe the Ae. albopictus olfactory repertoire we have used RNA-seq to reveal the transcriptome profiles of female antennae and maxillary palps. Male heads and whole female bodies were employed as reference for differential expression analysis. The relative transcript abundance within each tissue (TPM, transcripts per kilobase per million) and the pairwise differential abundance in the different tissues (fold change values and false discovery rates) were evaluated. Contigs upregulated in the antennae (620) and maxillary palps (268) were identified and relative GO and PFAM enrichment profiles analysed. Chemosensory genes were described: overall, 77 odorant binding proteins (OBP), 82 odorant receptors (OR), 60 ionotropic receptors (IR) and 30 gustatory receptors (GR) were identified by comparative genomics and transcriptomics. In addition, orthologs of genes expressed in the female/male maxillary palps and/or antennae and involved in thermosensation (e.g. pyrexia and arrestin1), mechanosensation (e.g. piezo and painless) and neuromodulation were classified.\nWe provide here the first detailed transcriptome of the main Ae. albopictus sensory appendages, i.e. antennae and maxillary palps.

Yet, the use of piezoelectric materials have largely been unexplored as a potential strategy in tissue engineering, wherein a piezoelectric biomaterial acts as a scaffold to promote cell behavior and the formation of large tissues. Here we show, for the first time, that piezoelectric materials can be fabricated into flexible, three-dimensional fibrous scaffolds and can be used to stimulate human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and corresponding extracellular matrix/tissue formation in physiological loading conditions. Piezoelectric scaffolds that exhibit low voltage output, or streaming potential, promoted chondrogenic differentiation and piezoelectric scaffolds with a high voltage output promoted osteogenic differentiation. Electromechanical stimulus promoted greater differentiation than mechanical loading alone.

However, the synthesis of NG devices with a high proportion of piezoelectric materials and a low polymer content, such as of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), continues to be problematic. In this work, high-piezoelectric-material-content flexible films produced from Pb(Zr,Ti)O\u2083 (PZT)-atomically-interconnected CNTs and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are presented. Various physical and chemical characterization techniques are employed to examine the morphology and structure of the materials. The direct growth of the piezoelectric material on the CNTs, by stirring the PZT and CNT mixed solution, results in various positive effects, such as a high-quality dispersion in the polymer matrix and addition of flexoelectricity to piezoelectricity, resulting in the enhancement of the output voltage by an external mechanical force.

{"title": "Crystallographic features of poly(vinylidene fluoride) film upon an attractive substrate of KBr.", "abstract": "Among all the polymorphs of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), the polar \u03b3-form possesses the highest melting point and electrical breakdown strength as well as the strongest solvent and irradiation resistance, which are beneficial for the durability of PVDF products. Since the \u03b3-form is neither kinetically favorable nor the most thermodynamically stable, it is still difficult to attain the exclusive \u03b3-polymorph, particularly in the case of neat PVDF. In this study, the melt isothermal crystallization of PVDF films was carried out between two KBr wafers. Owing to the characteristics of KBr wafer, including no IR absorbance and high optical transmittance, the crystallographic features originating from the KBr substrate can be conveniently elucidated through the in situ inspected techniques of FTIR and PLM. The KBr wafers significantly accelerated the crystallization kinetics of \u03b1-crystals, and then readily triggered the solid-state \u03b1- to \u03b3-transformation of the pre-formed \u03b1-spherulites, resulting in a 10 \u03bcm-thick, neat PVDF film with an absolute crystallinity of 35% and a relative \u03b3 fraction as high as 94%. When the film thickness was increased to 40 \u03bcm, the crystallization rate of the \u03b1-form was still rapid, but the solid-state transformation was not appreciable. These interesting crystallographic phenomena are attributed to the existence of ion-dipole interaction between the -CF", "journal": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": ["RuiHuang", "GangWang", "ShuoGuo", "KeWang", "QiangFu"], "doi": "10.1039/c7cp04741j"}

{"title": "Rise Time Reduction of Thermal Actuators Operated in Air and Water through Optimized Pre-Shaped Open-Loop Driving.", "abstract": "Electrothermal actuators have many advantages compared to other actuators used in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). They are simple to design, easy to fabricate and provide large displacements at low voltages. Low voltages enable less stringent passivation requirements for operation in liquid. Despite these advantages, thermal actuation is typically limited to a few kHz bandwidth when using step inputs due to its intrinsic thermal time constant. However, the use of pre-shaped input signals offers a route for reducing the rise time of these actuators by orders of magnitude. We started with an electrothermally actuated cantilever having an initial 10-90% rise time of 85 \u03bcs in air and 234 \u03bcs in water for a standard open-loop step input. We experimentally characterized the linearity and frequency response of the cantilever when operated in air and water, allowing us to obtain transfer functions for the two cases. We used these transfer functions, along with functions describing desired reduced rise-time system responses, to numerically simulate the required input signals. Using these pre-shaped input signals, we improved the open-loop 10-90% rise time from 85 \u03bcs to 3 \u03bcs in air and from 234 \u03bcs to 5 \u03bcs in water, an improvement by a factor of 28 and 47, respectively. Using this simple control strategy for MEMS electrothermal actuators makes them an attractive alternative to other high speed micromechanical actuators such as piezoelectric stacks or electrostatic comb structures which are more complex to design, fabricate, or operate.", "journal": "Journal of micromechanics and microengineering : structures, devices, and systems", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": ["TLarsen", "J CDoll", "FLoizeau", "NHosseini", "A WPeng", "GFantner", "A JRicci", "B LPruitt"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6439/aa5fd2"}

{"title": "Fractional order implementation of Integral Resonant Control - A nanopositioning application.", "abstract": "By exploiting the co-located sensor-actuator arrangement in typical flexure-based piezoelectric stack actuated nanopositioners, the polezero interlacing exhibited by their axial frequency response can be transformed to a zero-pole interlacing by adding a constant feed-through term. The Integral Resonant Control (IRC) utilizes this unique property to add substantial damping to the dominant resonant mode by the use of a simple integrator implemented in closed loop. IRC used in conjunction with an integral tracking scheme, effectively reduces positioning errors introduced by modelling inaccuracies or parameter uncertainties. Over the past few years, successful application of the IRC control technique to nanopositioning systems has demonstrated performance robustness, easy tunability and versatility. The main drawback has been the relatively small positioning bandwidth achievable. This paper proposes a fractional order implementation of the classical integral tracking scheme employed in tandem with the IRC scheme to deliver damping and tracking. The fractional order integrator introduces an additional design parameter which allows desired pole-placement, resulting in superior closed loop bandwidth. Simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the theory. A 250% improvement in the achievable positioning bandwidth is observed with proposed fractional order scheme.", "journal": "ISA transactions", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": ["AndresSan-Millan", "VicenteFeliu-Batlle", "Sumeet SAphale"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isatra.2017.09.022"}

Startle reflex was evaluated using a piezoelectric force platform. The results of the conducted study show that the range of vertical pressure force of the feet caused by the reaction to a strong acoustic stimulus is significantly smaller when this stimulus is preceded by a signal of lower intensity (prepulse). Such assessment is only possible with the participants' eyes open. The generalized startle response of a person may be estimated using a force platform, based on changes in the range of vertical pressure force of the feet on the ground, which are caused by unexpected acoustic stimuli.

{"title": "Advances in cyanobacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates production.", "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have received much attention in the current scenario due to their attractive material properties, namely biodegradability, biocompatibility, thermoplasticity, hydrophobicity, piezoelectricity and stereospecificity. All these properties make them highly competitive for various industrial applications similar to non-degradable conventional plastics. In PHA biosynthesis, PHA synthase acts as a natural catalyst for PHA polymerization process using the (R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA as substrate. Cyanobacteria can accumulate PHAs under photoautotrophic and/or mixotrophic growth conditions with organic substrates such as acetate, glucose, propionate, valerate, and so on. The natural incidence of PHA accumulation by the cyanobacteria is known since 1966. Nevertheless, PHA accumulation in cyanobacteria based on the cell biomass and volumetric productivity is critically lower than the heterotrophic bacteria. Consequently, cyanobacteria are nowadays not considered for commercial production of PHAs. Thus, strain improvements by genetic modification, new cultivation and harvesting techniques, advanced photobioreactor development, efficient and sustainable downstream processes, alternate economical carbon sources and usage of various metabolic inhibitors are suggested for enhancing cyanobacterial PHA accumulation. In addition, identification of transcriptional regulators like RNA polymerase sigma factor (SigE) and a response regulator (Rre37) together with the recent major scientific breakthrough on the existence of complete Krebs cycle in cyanobacteria would be helpful in taking PHA production from cyanobacteria to a new-fangled height in near future.", "journal": "FEMS microbiology letters", "date": "2017-09-30", "authors": ["Akhilesh KumarSingh", "NirupamaMallick"], "doi": "10.1093/femsle/fnx189"}

It has been found that the domain interaction leads to the intermittent quasiperiodic and chaotic behavior of the domain length in the array in a manner similar to that of polar cuts, but with greater spacing between the points of bias application and voltage amplitudes. It has also been found that the polarization reversal at the non-polar cuts and domain interaction significantly depend on humidity. The spatial distribution of the surface potential measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy in the vicinity of the charged domain walls revealed the decrease of the domain length as a result of the partial backswitching after pulse termination. The phase diagram of switching behavior as a function of tip voltage and spacing between the points of bias application has been plotted.

The level of \u03b2-actin, GAPDH, \u03b2-tubulin, and total protein were tested. The total protein level was consistent in all groups, whereas the protein level of \u03b2-tubulin and \u03b2-actin were different in all groups. However, the protein level of GAPDH was stable in the Rhesus monkey model. We concluded that total protein was the most appropriate internal control in different stages of myocardial ischemic disease of various animal models. GAPDH is a reliable internal control only for ischemic myocardium of Rhesus monkey.", "journal": "Biochemistry and biophysics reports", "date": "2017-09-29", "authors": ["XinNie", "ChenLi", "ShengHu", "FulaiXue", "Y JamesKang", "WenjingZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrep.2017.09.001"}

Interestingly, the replacement of five amino acids among 11 C-terminal amino acids dramatically increased affinity against the large N-terminal fragment, LgBiT, and the complex had NanoLuc luciferase activity. In this study, we first applied this small fragment, HiBiT, to elucidate the expression of ATF4 protein by transient overexpression of HiBiT-tagged ATF4. According to the regulation of intrinsic ATF4 protein, stabilization of HiBiT-tagged ATF4 with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, was observed by detecting luciferase activity in cell lysate and after SDS-PAGE and transfer onto a PVDF membrane. Next, we knocked-in the HiBiT-epitope tag into the ATF4 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and rapidly selected positive clones by measuring luciferase activity in an aliquot of each cell suspension. Using a selected clone, we observed that the expression of HiBiT-tagged ATF4 in the selected cells varied in response to treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors or proteasome inhibitors and tunicamycin.

A few years ago, Sc was also found to be suitable for use in electrical devices. High-Sc-content ScAlN thin films have attracted significant attention because of their strong piezoelectricity. The piezoelectric response of ScAlN suggests that ScAlN thin films formed on a hard substrate would be suitable surface acoustic wave wideband filters for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, it is often difficult to use ScAlN thin films in MEMS devices-including acoustic ones-because of the extremely high price of metallic Sc, given the difficulty associated with smelting it. Here, we propose a novel process for smelting Sc metal by microwave irradiation. Sc metal was able to be obtained successfully from ScF\u2083 through a microwave-irradiation-based carbon reduction reaction. The reaction temperature for this reduction process was approximately 880\u00b0C, which is half of that for the conventional smelting process involving reduction with Ca.

The biggest challenge for catheter guidance by ultrasound lies in distinguishing the catheter from neighboring tissue, as well as the ability to differentiate the catheter body from its tip.\nIn our previous work, we introduced a functional prototype of an acoustically active catheter, in which a miniature piezoelectric crystal allowed accurate localization of the catheter tip by pulsed wave (PW) Doppler imaging and Doppler spectrogram. In this paper, the theory behind the symmetric Doppler shift due to the interaction of ultrasound wave with a vibrating piezoelectric crystal is explained. The theory is validated in an experimental continuous flow phantom setup. A novel algorithm, symmetric frequency detection algorithm, is presented for identification and visualization of the catheter tip in real time along with B-mode and PW Doppler.\nThe catheter tip is identified with a distinct color differentiable from common Doppler colors with a frame rate varying from 22 to 50\u00a0Hz. The catheter tip can be visualized in a small region of 2.4 mm in the elevational direction.\nThe algorithm can be implemented in most clinical ultrasound machines with minor additions to the PW Doppler processing algorithm.

{"title": "Contact atomic force microscopy using piezoresistive cantilevers in load force modulation mode.", "abstract": "Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) encompasses several techniques for imaging of the physical and chemical material properties at nanoscale. The scanning process is based on the detection of the deflection of the cantilever, which is caused by near field interactions, while the tip runs over the sample's surface. The variety of deflection detection methods including optical, piezoresistive, piezoelectric technologies has been developed and applied depending on the measurement mode and measurement environment. There are many advantages (compactness, vacuum compatibility, etc.) of the piezoresistive detection method, which makes it very attractive for almost all SPM experiments. Due to the technological limitations the stiffness of the piezoresistive beams is usually higher than the stiffness of the cantilever detected using optical methods. This is the basic constraint for the application of the piezoresistive beams in contact mode (CM) atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations performed at low load forces (usually less than 20\u00a0nN). Drift of the deflection signal, which is related to thermal fluctuations of the measurement setup, causes that the microscope controller compensates the fluctuations instead of compensating the strength of tip-surface interactions. Therefore, it is quite difficult to keep near field interaction precisely at the setpoint level during the whole scanning process. This can lead to either damage of the cantilever's tip and material surface or loosing the contact with the investigated sample and making the measurement unreliable. For these reasons, load force modulation (LoFM) scanning mode, in which the interaction at the tip is precisely controlled at every point of the sample surface, is proposed to enable precise AFM surface investigations using the piezoresistive cantilevers. In this article we describe the developed measurement algorithm as well as proposed and introduced hardware and software solutions. The results of the experiments confirm strong reduction of the AFM entire setup drift. The results demonstrating contactless tip lateral movements are presented.

{"title": "Steady Method for the Analysis of Evaporation Dynamics.", "abstract": "Droplet evaporation is an important phenomenon governing many man-made and natural processes. Characterizing the rate of evaporation with high accuracy has attracted the attention of numerous scientists over the past century. Traditionally, researchers have studied evaporation by observing the change in the droplet size in a given time interval. However, the transient nature coupled with the significant mass-transfer-governed gas dynamics occurring at the droplet three-phase contact line makes the classical method crude. Furthermore, the intricate balance played by the internal and external flows, evaporation kinetics, thermocapillarity, binary-mixture dynamics, curvature, and moving contact lines makes the decoupling of these processes impossible with classical transient methods. Here, we present a method to measure the rate of evaporation of spatially and temporally steady droplets. By utilizing a piezoelectric dispenser to feed microscale droplets (R \u2248 9 \u03bcm) to a larger evaporating droplet at a prescribed frequency, we can both create variable-sized droplets on any surface and study their evaporation rate by modulating the piezoelectric droplet addition frequency.

The degree of renal degeneration from the resection surface was compared by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining and immunostaining for 1-methyladenosine, a sensitive marker for the ischemic tissue damage. The mRNA levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), a biomarker for acute kidney injury, were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Off-clamp LPN with ADPJ system was successfully performed while preserving fine blood vessels and the renal calix with little bleeding. In contrast to other devices, the resection surface obtained with the ADPJ system showed only marginal degree of ischemic changes. Indeed, the expression level of Ngal mRNA was lower in the resection surface obtained with the ADPJ system than that with soft coagulation (p = 0.02).

Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop and test a phage-based paper dipstick biosensor for the detection of various foodborne pathogens in food matrices. The first step was to identify the best method for immobilizing phages on paper such that their biological activity (infectivity) was preserved. It was found that piezoelectric inkjet printing resulted in lower loss of phage infectivity when compared with other printing methods (namely gravure and blade coating) and that ColorLok paper was ideally suited to create functional sensors. The phage-based bioactive papers developed with use of piezoelectric inkjet printing actively lysed their target bacteria and retained this antibacterial activity for up to 1 week when stored at room temperature and 80% relative humidity. These bioactive paper strips in combination with quantitative real-time PCR were used for quantitative determination of target bacteria in broth and food matrices. A phage dipstick was used to capture and infect Escherichia coli O157:H7, E. coli O45:H2, and Salmonella Newport in spinach, ground beef and chicken homogenates, respectively, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the progeny phages. A detection limit of 10-50 colony-forming units per millilitre was demonstrated with a total assay time of 8 h, which was the duration of a typical work shift in an industrial setting. This detection method is rapid and cost-effective, and may potentially be applied to a broad range of bacterial foodborne pathogens.

In this model, a time-dependent driving force is applied to actuate the droplet ejection. As a result, the actuation can be accurately controlled by adjusting the intensity and duration of the positive and negative forces, as well as the idle time. The present model was verified by reproducing the actual single droplet ejection process captured by fast imaging. This model was subsequently used to investigate droplet formation in piezoelectric inkjet printing. It was determined that the wettability of the nozzle inner wall and the surface tension of the ink are vital factors controlling the print quality and speed. Increasing the contact angle of the nozzle inner delays the droplet breakup time and reduces the droplet velocity. In contrast, higher surface tension values promote earlier droplet breakup and faster drop velocity. These results indicate that the hydrophilic modification of the nozzle inner wall and the choice of inks with high surface tensions will improve printing quality.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-09-21", "authors": ["BingHe", "SucuiYang", "ZhangrongQin", "BinghaiWen", "ChaoyingZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-12189-7\n10.1016/j.physrep.2010.03.003\n10.1002/adma.200901141\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-120710-101148\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.1.014004\n10.1063/1.2217929\n10.1016/j.measurement.2008.03.016\n10.1103/PhysRevE.83.036306\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.074506\n10.1016/j.compfluid.2008.06.003\n10.1002/fld.3997\n10.1098/rspa.1997.0137\n10.1016/j.jcp.2004.12.012\n10.1063/1.2800784\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-121108-145519\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.30.1.329\n10.1007/s00170-009-2255-9\n10.1143/JJAP.49.060217\n10.1088/0960-1317/20/1/015033\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.034504\n10.1088/0960-1317/16/1/024\n10.1023/A:1010414013942\n10.1007/s10404-010-0624-1\n10.1209/0295-5075/112/44002\n10.1016/j.jcp.2014.02.018\n10.1147/rd.283.0314\n10.1016/j.jcp.2007.08.010\n10.1016/j.jcp.2006.02.015\n10.1063/1.1744102"}

Bone also processes electromechanical properties, such as piezoelectricity and streaming potentials, which termed as stress generated potentials. Furthermore, the electrostrictive effect and flexoelectric effect can also affect electromechanical properties of the bone. In the present work, time responses of bending deflections of bone cantilever in an external electric field are measured experimentally to investigate bone's electromechanical behavior. It is found that, when subjected to a square waveform electric field, a bone cantilever specimen begins to bend and its deflection increases gradually to a peak value. Then, the deflection begins to decrease gradually during the period of constant voltage. To analyze the reasons of the bending response of bone, additional experiments were performed. Experimental results obtained show the following two features. The first one is that the electric polarization, induced in bone by an electric field, is due to the Maxwell-Wagner polarization mechanism that the polarization rate is relatively slow, which leads to the electric field force acted on a bone specimen increase gradually and then its bending deflections increase gradually. The second one is that the flexoelectric polarization effect that resists the electric force to decrease and then leads to the bending deflection of a bone cantilever decrease gradually. It is concluded that the first aspect refers to the organic collagens decreasing the electric polarization rate of the bone, and the second one to the inorganic component influencing the bone's polarization intensity.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2017-09-20", "authors": ["HuiminKang", "ZhendeHou", "Qing-HuaQin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.09.017"}

In the present study, the solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure and the analytical method for dissolved BMAA in water were investigated and optimized. The results showed both derivatized and underivatized methods were qualified for the measurement of BMAA and its isomer in natural water, and the limit of detection and the precision of the two methods were comparable. Cartridge characteristics and SPE conditions could greatly affect the SPE performance, and the competition of natural organic matter is the primary factor causing the low recovery of BMAA, which was reduced from approximately 90% in pure water to 38.11% in natural water. The optimized SPE method for BMAA was a combination of rinsed SPE cartridges, controlled loading/elution rates and elution solution, evaporation at 55 \u00b0C, reconstitution of a solution mixture, and filtration by polyvinylidene fluoride membrane.

To date, such findings have not been confirmed in any other mammalian sperm species. An important question that has remained regarding these observations is whether the fast [Ca2+]i oscillations are real or might they be due to remaining defocusing effects of the Z component arising from the 3D beating of the flagella.\nHealthy donors whose semen samples fulfill the WHO criteria between the age of 18-28 were selected. Cells from at least six different donors were utilized for analysis. Approximately the same number of experimental and control cells were analyzed.\nMotile cells were obtained by the swim-up technique and were loaded with Fluo-4 (Ca2+ sensitive dye) or with Calcein (Ca2+ insensitive dye). Ni2+ was used as a non-specific plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker. Fluorescence data and flagella position were acquired in 3D. Each cell was recorded for up to 5.6 s within a depth of 16 microns with a high speed camera (coupled to an image intensifier) acquiring at a rate of 3000 frames per second, while an oscillating objective vibrated at 90 Hz via a piezoelectric device. From these samples, eight experimental and nine control sperm cells were analyzed in both 2D and 3D.\nWe have implemented a new system that allows [Ca2+]i measurements of the human sperm flagellum beating in 3D. These measurements reveal statistically significant [Ca2+]i oscillations that correlate with the flagellar beating frequency. These oscillations may arise from intracellular sources and/or Ca2+ transporters, as they were insensitive to external Ni2+, a non-specific plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker.\nN/A.\nAnalysis in 3D needs a very fast image acquisition rate to correctly sample a volume containing swimming sperm. This condition requires a very short exposure time per image making it necessary to use an image intensifier which also increases noise. The lengthy analysis time required to obtain reliable results limited the number of cells that could be analyzed.\nThe possibility of recording flagellar [Ca2+]i oscillations described here may open a new avenue to better understand ciliary and flagellar beating that are fundamental for mucociliary clearance, oocyte transport, fertilization, cerebrospinal fluid pressure regulation and developmental left-right symmetry breaking in the embryonic node.\nThis work was supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CONACyT) (grants 253952 to G.C.; 156667 to F.M.M. and Fronteras 71 39908-Q to A.D. and Post-doctoral scholarships 366844 to P.H.-H. and 291028 to F.M.) and the Direcci\u00f3n General de Asuntos del Personal Acad\u00e9mico of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (DGAPA-UNAM) (grants CJIC/CTIC/4898/2016 to F.M. and IN205516 to A.D.).

{"title": "A low-cost, large field-of-view scanning ion conductance microscope for studying nanoparticle-cell membrane interactions.", "abstract": "Nanoparticles have the potential to become versatile tools in the medical and life sciences. One potential application is delivering drugs or other compounds to the cell cytoplasm, which requires the nanoparticles to bind to or cross the cell membrane. However, there are only a few tools available which allow studying the interaction of nanoparticles and the cell membrane of living cells in a physiological environment. Currently, the tool which least biases living cells is Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM). Specialized SICMs allow imaging at high resolution, however, they are cost intensive, particularly when providing a large field-of-view. In contrast, less cost intensive SICMs which provide a large field-of-view do not allow imaging at high resolutions. We have developed a SICM setup consisting of a compact three-axis piezo system and an additional fast shear-force piezo actor. This combination allows imaging fields-of-view of up to 80 \u03bcm \u00d7 80 \u03bcm, recording sections of living cells with a temporal resolution in the range of minutes as well as imaging with a spatial resolution of below 70 nm. Using our SICM we found that the cell membrane of HeLa cells treated with carboxylated latex nanoparticles was significantly more convoluted compared to control cells. The SICM setup we introduce here combines high resolution imaging with a large field-of-view at low costs. Our setup only requires a mounting adapter to extend existing inverted light microscopes, thus it could be a valuable and cost effective tool for researchers in all fields of the medical and life sciences performing investigations at the nanometer scale.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2017-09-15", "authors": ["AstridGesper", "PhilippHagemann", "PatrickHappel"], "doi": "10.1039/c7nr04306f"}
{"title": "Investigating the structural dynamics of the PIEZO1 channel activation and inactivation by coarse-grained modeling.", "abstract": "The PIEZO channels, a family of mechanosensitive channels in vertebrates, feature a fast activation by mechanical stimuli (eg, membrane tension) followed by a slower inactivation. Although a medium-resolution structure of the trimeric form of PIEZO1 was solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), key structural changes responsible for the channel activation and inactivation are still unknown. Toward decrypting the structural mechanism of the PIEZO1 activation and inactivation, we performed systematic coarse-grained modeling using an elastic network model and related modeling/analysis tools (ie, normal mode analysis, flexibility and hotspot analysis, correlation analysis, and cryo-EM-based hybrid modeling and flexible fitting). We identified four key motional modes that may drive the tension-induced activation and inactivation, with fast and slow relaxation time, respectively. These modes allosterically couple the lateral and vertical motions of the peripheral domains to the opening and closing of the intra-cellular vestibule, enabling external mechanical forces to trigger, and regulate the activation/inactivation transitions. We also calculated domain-specific flexibility profiles, and predicted hotspot residues at key domain-domain interfaces and hinges. Our results offer unprecedented structural and dynamic information, which is consistent with the literature on mutational and functional studies of the PIEZO channels, and will guide future studies of this important family of mechanosensitive channels.", "journal": "Proteins", "date": "2017-09-15", "authors": ["WenjunZheng", "FrederickSachs"], "doi": "10.1002/prot.25384"}
{"title": "How Chain Intermixing Dictates the Polymorphism of PVDF in Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/Polymethylmethacrylate Binary System during Recrystallization: A Comparative Study on Core\u207bShell Particles and Latex Blend.", "abstract": "In the past few decades, Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/Polymethylmethacrylate (PVDF/PMMA) binary blend has attracted substantial attention in the scientific community due to possible intriguing mechanical, optical and ferroelectric properties that are closely related to its multiple crystal structures/phases. However, the effect of PMMA phase on the polymorphism of PVDF, especially the relationship between miscibility and polymorphism, remains an open question and is not yet fully understood. In this work, three series of particle blends with varied levels of miscibility between PVDF and PMMA were prepared via seeded emulsion polymerization: PVDF\u207bPMMA core\u207bshell particle (PVDF@PMMA) with high miscibility; PVDF/PMMA latex blend with modest miscibility; and PVDF@c\u207bPMMA (crosslinked PMMA) core\u207bshell particle with negligible miscibility. The difference in miscibility, and the corresponding morphology and polymorphism were systematically studied to correlate the PMMA/PVDF miscibility with PVDF polymorphism. It is of interest to observe that the formation of polar \u03b2/\u03b3 phase during melt crystallization could be governed in two ways: dipole\u207bdipole interaction and fast crystallization. For PVDF@PMMA and PVDF/PMMA systems, in which fast crystallization was unlikely triggered, higher content of \u03b2/\u03b3 phase, and intense suppression of crystallization temperature and capacity were observed in PVDF@PMMA, because high miscibility favored a higher intensity of overall dipole\u207bdipole interaction and a longer interaction time. For PVDF@c\u207bPMMA system, after a complete coverage of PVDF seeds by PMMA shells, nearly pure \u03b2/\u03b3 phase was obtained owing to the fast homogeneous nucleation. This is the first report that high miscibility between PVDF and PMMA could favor the formation of \u03b2/\u03b3 phase.", "journal": "Polymers", "date": "2017-09-14", "authors": ["YueLi", "GuoqiangZhang", "ShaofengSong", "HaijunXu", "MingwangPan", "Gan-JiZhong"], "doi": "10.3390/polym9090448\n10.1016/j.matchemphys.2008.09.018\n10.1007/s10853-012-6379-1\n10.1021/ma301460h\n10.1002/polb.21264\n10.1016/00323-8619(59)92967-\n10.1002/pen.10558\n10.1016/j.polymer.2010.01.055\n10.1021/ma00229a008\n10.1021/ma00244a007\n10.1021/ma60044a013\n10.1021/ma60077a057\n10.1021/ma00015a031\n10.1016/j.tca.2007.05.023\n10.1016/j.polymer.2011.09.045\n10.1021/ma500249p\n10.1038/pj.2013.53\n10.1002/pc.23022\n10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2012.06.021\n10.1007/s10853-009-3395-x\n10.1039/c1sm06498c\n10.1002/masy.200550435\n10.1002/sia.2003\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2007.04.001\n10.1007/BF00657448\n10.1002/mren.200600006\n10.1007/BF01987426\n10.1021/ma60048a040\n10.1021/ma50007a028\n10.1063/1.325780\n10.1007/BF00262191\n10.1021/acs.macromol.5b01895\n10.1016/j.polymer.2004.05.034\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2006.08.003\n10.1016/S0142-9418(03)00003-5\n10.1016/j.polymer.2016.01.003\n10.1007/s10853-010-4519-z"}

{"title": "Autonomous Sensors Powered by Energy Harvesting from von Karman Vortices in Airflow.", "abstract": "In this paper an energy harvesting system based on a piezoelectric converter to extract energy from airflow and use it to power battery-less sensors is presented. The converter is embedded as a part of a flexure beam that is put into vibrations by von Karman vortices detached from a bluff body placed upstream. The vortex street has been investigated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, aiming at assessing the vortex shedding frequency as a function of the flow velocity. From the simulation results the preferred positioning of the beam behind the bluff body has been derived. In the experimental characterization the electrical output from the converter has been measured for different flow velocities and beam orientations. Highest conversion effectiveness is obtained by an optimal orientation of the beam, to exploit the maximum forcing, and for flow velocities where the repetition frequency of the vortices allows to excite the beam resonant frequency at its first flexural mode. The possibility to power battery-less sensors and make them autonomous has been shown by developing an energy management and signal conditioning electronic circuit plus two sensors for measuring temperature and flow velocity and transmitting their values over a RF signal.

The presented studies aim at the improvement of this electromechanical stimulation (EMS) approach by substituting the external hearing aid by an internal stimulus provided by miniaturized piezoelectric actuators. Finite element analyses are performed in order to derive fundamental guidelines for the actuator layout aiming at maximal mechanical stimuli. Further analyses aim at investigating how the actuator position inside the cochlea influences the basilar membrane oscillation profile. While actuator layout guidelines leading to maximized acoustic stimuli could be derived, some of these guidelines are of complementary nature suggesting that further studies under realistic boundary conditions must be performed. Actuator positioning inside the cochlea is shown to have a significant influence on the resulting auditory impression of the patient.

All sutural ostectomies were performed using a piezoelectric instrument (Woodpecker DTE, DS-II, Guangxi, China) before expander application with the rabbits under anesthesia. Modified hyrax expanders were placed across the midsagittal sutures of the rabbits and secured with miniscrew implants located bilaterally in the frontal bone. The hyrax expanders were activated 0.5\u00a0mm/day for 12\u00a0days (group 1) or with a 2.5-mm initial expansion, followed by 0.5\u00a0mm/day for 7\u00a0days (groups 2 to 4). After 6\u00a0weeks of retention, the bone volume fraction, sutural separation, and new bone formation were evaluated using micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman's rho correlation (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nRanking of the median sutural separation was as follows: group 1, 3.05\u00a0mm; group 2, 3.97\u00a0mm; group 4, 4.78\u00a0mm; and group 3, 5.66\u00a0mm.

The purpose of this study is to introduce the nonlinear parameter to the FEM and to establish the method for measuring the nonlinear parameter through evaluating a nonlinear model for a piezoelectric vibration. In a previous study about the nonlinear piezoelectric vibration, the third term was mainly focused on because the third mode vibration affects the fundamental vibration in the case of a simple bar-type transducer. On the other hand, we considered the second nonlinear parameter of the compliance to the piezoelectric constitutive equation. We observed that this parameter affects the vibration amplitude with each position and the velocity at the tip of the transducer with a double frequency at resonant. It was confirmed that two measured nonlinear parameters based on these two relationships were almost same. From these values, we concluded that the proposed model is reasonable.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-09-12", "authors": ["RyoheiOzaki", "YaoyangLiu", "HiroshiHosaka", "TakeshiMorita"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.04.009"}

The secular equations in the flexoelectric piezoelectric material are first derived from the general governing equation. Different from the classical piezoelectric medium, there are five kinds of coupled elastic waves in the piezoelectric material with the microstructure effects taken into consideration. The state vectors are obtained by the summation of contributions from all possible partial waves. The state transfer equation of flexoelectric piezoelectric slab is derived from the motion equation by the reduction of order, and the transfer matrix of flexoelectric piezoelectric slab is obtained by solving the state transfer equation. By using the continuous conditions at the interface and the approach of partition matrix, we get the resultant algebraic equations in term of the transfer matrix from which the reflection and transmission coefficients can be calculated. The amplitude ratios and further the energy flux ratios of various waves are evaluated numerically. The numerical results are shown graphically and are validated by the energy conservation law.

Eight weeks after implantation, immunofluorescence staining showed that the HAP stem cells differentiated into neurons and glial cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the HAP stem cell hair spheres promoted rejoining of the sciatic nerve of both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that the severed scatic nerves had regenerated. Quantitative walking analysis showed that the transplanted mice recovered the ability to walk normally.

Chemical stability of the polymers of XIENCE stents in the in-vivo environment was evaluated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) detection. For this evaluation, XIENCE stents explanted from porcine coronary arteries and from human coronary artery specimens at autopsy after 2-4 and 5-7 years of implantation, respectively, were compared to freshly manufactured XIENCE stents (controls). The comparison of pyrograms of explanted stent samples and controls showed identical fragmentation fingerprints of polymers, indicating that PVDF-HFP and PBMA maintained their chemical integrity after multiple years of XIENCE coronary stent implantation.

{"title": "Complex Dynamical Networks Constructed with Fully Controllable Nonlinear Nanomechanical Oscillators.", "abstract": "Control of the global parameters of complex networks has been explored experimentally in a variety of contexts. Yet, the more difficult prospect of realizing arbitrary network architectures, especially analog physical networks that provide dynamical control of individual nodes and edges, has remained elusive. Given the vast hierarchy of time scales involved, it also proves challenging to measure a complex network's full internal dynamics. These span from the fastest nodal dynamics to very slow epochs over which emergent global phenomena, including network synchronization and the manifestation of exotic steady states, eventually emerge. Here, we demonstrate an experimental system that satisfies these requirements. It is based upon modular, fully controllable, nonlinear radio frequency nanomechanical oscillators, designed to form the nodes of complex dynamical networks with edges of arbitrary topology. The dynamics of these oscillators and their surrounding network are analog and continuous-valued and can be fully interrogated in real time. They comprise a piezoelectric nanomechanical membrane resonator, which serves as the frequency-determining element within an electrical feedback circuit. This embodiment permits network interconnections entirely within the electrical domain and provides unprecedented node and edge control over a vast region of parameter space. Continuous measurement of the instantaneous amplitudes and phases of every constituent oscillator node are enabled, yielding full and detailed network data without reliance upon statistical quantities.

{"title": "Nano-Composite Foam Sensor System in Football Helmets.", "abstract": "American football has both the highest rate of concussion incidences as well as the highest number of concussions of all contact sports due to both the number of athletes and nature of the sport. Recent research has linked concussions with long term health complications such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and early onset Alzheimer's. Understanding the mechanical characteristics of concussive impacts is critical to help protect athletes from these debilitating diseases and is now possible using helmet-based sensor systems. To date, real time on-field measurement of head impacts has been almost exclusively measured by devices that rely on accelerometers or gyroscopes attached to the player's helmet, or embedded in a mouth guard. These systems monitor motion of the head or helmet, but do not directly measure impact energy. This paper evaluates the accuracy of a novel, multifunctional foam-based sensor that replaces a portion of the helmet foam to measure impact. All modified helmets were tested using a National Operating Committee Standards for Athletic Equipment-style drop tower with a total of 24 drop tests (4 locations with 6 impact energies). The impacts were evaluated using a headform, instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer, mounted to a Hybrid III neck assembly. The resultant accelerations were evaluated for both the peak acceleration and the severity indices. These data were then compared to the voltage response from multiple Nano Composite Foam sensors located throughout the helmet. The foam sensor system proved to be accurate in measuring both the HIC and Gadd severity index, as well as peak acceleration while also providing additional details that were previously difficult to obtain, such as impact energy.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2017-09-09", "authors": ["A JakeMerrell", "William FChristensen", "Matthew KSeeley", "Anton EBowden", "David TFullwood"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-017-1910-9"}

{"title": "Reactive Compatibilization: Formation of Double-Grafted Copolymers by In Situ Binary Grafting and Their Compatibilization Effect.", "abstract": "Reactive compatibilizers are usually used to enhance the compatibility of immiscible polymer blends. However, reactive linear compatibilizers containing reactive groups on the main chains form graft copolymers during reactive blending, and such graft copolymers with an asymmetric molecular structure are often \"pulled in\" or \"pulled out\" under mechanical shear. Double-grafted compatibilizers have a symmetric structure, and they usually exhibit higher compatibilizing efficiency. In this work, we propose a binary grafting strategy during melt blending to form compatibilizers located at the interface of an immiscible polymer blend. Specifically, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) oligomer with carboxylic end groups (PMMA-COOH) and poly(styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (SG) copolymer were simultaneously incorporated into immiscible poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(l-lactic acid) (PVDF/PLLA) blends. The carboxylic acid groups of both the PMMA oligomer and PLLA can react with the epoxide groups on the SG main chains. Therefore, novel compatibilizing polymers with both PMMA and PLLA chains grafted onto the SG main chains form in situ. The grafted PMMA chains can entangle with PVDF, and the grafted PLLA chains are embedded in the PLLA phase, so the double-grafted copolymers act as effective compatibilizers for the PVDF/PLLA blends. Moreover, the effects of the PMMA molecular weight and PMMA loading (number of grafted PMMA side chains) on the compatibilization efficiency were investigated. The compatibilizing efficiency increases with increasing molecular weight and number of side chains in the ranges considered in this study. This one-pot synthesis of double-grafted compatibilizers by in situ grafting provides a new and simple method to prepare double-comb compatibilizers, and it offers the possibility of high-efficiency compatibilization.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-09-09", "authors": ["DepeiChen", "HengtiWang", "YongjinLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b08699"}
{"title": "Helix Electrohydrodynamic Printing of Highly Aligned Serpentine Micro/Nanofibers.", "abstract": "Micro/nano serpentine structures have widespread applications in flexible/stretchable electronics; however, challenges still exist for low-cost, high-efficiency and controllable manufacturing. Helix electrohydrodynamic printing (HE-printing) has been proposed here to realize controllable direct-writing of large area, highly aligned serpentine micro/nanofibers by introducing the rope coiling effect into printing process. By manipulating the flying trajectory and solidification degree of the micro/nano jet, the solidified micro/nanofiber flying in a stabilized helical manner and versatile serpentine structures deposited on a moving collector have been achieved. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the transformation behavior and the size changing rules for various deposited microstructures, and highly aligned serpentine microfibers were directly written by controlling the applied voltage, nozzle-to-collector distance and collector velocity.

{"title": "Q-Factor Spectrum of a Piezoceramic Resonator and Method for Piezoelectric Loss Factor Determination.", "abstract": "The quality factor (Q) spectrum of a piezoceramic resonator, as a Q-factor frequency dependence for the specific resonator and its vibrational modes, was determined under baseline low-excitation level with a new approach proposed. The theoretical prediction was experimentally confirmed that the resonator Q-factor increases with frequency nearly linearly from the resonance reaching its maximum near the antiresonance. For the industrial PZT-5A piezoceramic the antiresonance-to-resonance quality factor ratio is 1.8 to 2.4 as much, depending on the type of vibration. As the theory states, this effect is directly related to the piezoelectric \"losses\" in piezoceramics, usually represented by the imaginary part of complex piezocoefficients, which have a unique property of lowering the total cumulative energy dissipation in a resonator in certain frequency intervals. Based on the electromechanical Q-factor (EMQ) concept, a new relatively simple method was proposed for the piezoelectric loss factor determination at just a single resonance frequency-it requires measurements of the resonance Q-factor and its frequency derivative at the resonance, or the first and second frequency derivatives of the immittance phase at the resonance. Experimentally determined is close to near 0.8 of its upper (positive) phenomenological limit in the conventional PZT-5A piezoceramic at the basic vibrational modes. The piezoelectric loss factor, theoretically reaching the upper limit, can provide extremely high value of the Q-factor (near the fundamental antiresonance) with possible an order of magnitude EMQ increase. That paradoxical fact for the piezoelectric \"losses\" is a novel possible way of improving the piezoceramic performance and operation.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2017-09-08", "authors": ["AlexMezheritsky"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2748901"}

For our experimental work, two types of lead-free piezoelectric ceramic coatings, including potassium-sodium niobate-based and bismuth sodium titanate-based, are fabricated by thermal spray process, and their structure, morphology, and piezoelectric properties are characterized. Our obtained lead-free ceramic coatings exhibit single phase of perovskite structure, relatively dense morphology, and competitive piezoelectric coefficients. The mechanism of forming the piezoelectric perovskite crystalline phase by thermal spray involving melting-recrystallization process is analyzed in comparison to that of ceramic synthesis through solid-state reaction. Suppression of volatile loss and decomposition at high temperature due to the extremely high melting and cooling rate in the thermal spray process, and the impact on the resulting structure are discussed. Significant advantages of the thermal spray method over alternative processing methods for forming piezoelectric ceramic coatings are summarized.

The shell is obtained by plastically deforming an initially flat copper disc, so as to induce large isotropic and almost uniform inelastic curvatures. Following the plastic deformation, in a perfectly isotropic system, the shell is theoretically neutrally stable, having a continuous set of stable cylindrical shapes corresponding to the rotation of the axis of maximal curvature. Small imperfections render the actual structure bistable, giving preferred orientations. A three-parameter piezoelectric actuation, exerted through micro-fibre-composite actuators, allows us to add a small perturbation to the plastic inelastic curvature and to control the direction of maximal curvature. This actuation law is designed through a geometrical analogy based on a fully nonlinear inextensible uniform-curvature shell model. We report on the fabrication, identification and experimental testing of a prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness of the piezoelectric actuators in controlling its shape. The resulting motion is an apparent rotation of the shell, controlled by the voltages as in a 'gear-less motor', which is, in reality, a precession of the axis of principal curvature.", "journal": "Proceedings.

The LVT Q-filter is designed based on the modulus maximum of wavelet detail coefficients calculated by wavelet transform to determine the high-frequency locations of each iteration with the advantages of avoiding cross-terms and segmenting manually. The proposed approach was verified on a piezo nanopositioner. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can locate the high-frequency regions accurately and achieve the best performance under varying references compared with traditional frequency-domain and projection ILC with a fixed-bandwidth Q-filter, which validates that through implementing the LTV filter on projection ILC, high-bandwidth and flexible tracking can be achieved simultaneously by the proposed approach.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2017-09-03", "authors": ["ZhaoFeng", "JieLing", "MinMing", "Xiao-HuiXiao"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4998303"}

The ability to control the Q factor of multiple modes is believed to be of great benefit for atomic force microscopy techniques involving multiple eigenmodes. In this paper, we propose a novel cantilever design employing multiple piezoelectric transducers which are used for separated actuation and sensing, leading to guaranteed collocation of the first eight eigenmodes up to 3\u2009MHz. The design minimizes the feedthrough usually observed with these systems by incorporating a guard trace on the cantilever chip. As a result, a multimode Q controller is demonstrated to be able to modify the quality factor of the first two eigenmodes over up to four orders of magnitude without sacrificing robust stability.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2017-09-03", "authors": ["Michael GRuppert", "Yuen KYong"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4990451"}

An original encapsulation technique was performed to provide the stiff active element with a compliant cover as an interface towards the soft human skin. The interface stiffness, together with the new geometry, generated an effective transmission of vibrotactile stimulation and made the encapsulated transducer a performant component for the development of wearable tactile displays. The mechanical behavior of the developed transducer was numerically modeled as a function of the driving voltage and frequency, and the exerted normal forces were experimentally measured with a load cell. The actuator was then tested for the integration in a haptic glove in single-finger and bi-finger condition, in a 2-AFC tactile stimulus recognition test.

{"title": "Phantom study evaluating detection of simulated upper airway occlusion using piezoelectric ultrasound transducers.", "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by repetitive narrowing or full collapse of the upper airway concomitant with continued respiratory effort during sleep lasting 10s or more. OSAHS is the most prevalent form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting more than 17% of the middle-aged U.S.\nHence, many individuals need to be tested for having OSAHS. Currently, detection of airway occlusion due to OSAHS is achieved by indirect measurements, often requiring multiple sensor types, such as a flow transducer combined with chest and abdomen plethysmography. The need for the use of multiple sensors in the current OSAHS detection systems adds to the cost and complexity of the current systems and associated procedures. Development of a simple sensor system that allows direct detection of airway occlusion is advantageous, as it simplifies detection of OSAHS and paves the way for home diagnosis of OSAHS. The utilization of ultrasonic transducers is attractive, as it is non-invasive and non-ionizing. We present a new ultrasound sensing system for direct detection of the occlusion in the upper airway in OSAHS patients during sleep. The system takes into consideration the constraints arising from the location of probing and the acoustic requirements for transducers. The physiological and theoretical backgrounds are presented for using ultrasonic pulses to detect the presence and degree of occlusion in the airway. The proposed methodology for creating an anthropomorphically-correct neck and airway phantoms to test the hypothesis and the results of the tests are presented.\nAn ultrasonic signal transmitted through or reflected from an open airway will have different features compared to those associated with a partially or fully occluded airway.\nA system, comprising a phantom model of the airway and neck with the approximate anatomical-correct dimensions and acoustic properties of the airway, is designed and built. It allows simulating fully open airway as well as hypopnea and apnea events. Further, it facilitates probing using multiple ultrasonic frequencies and transducer configurations for use with different neck sizes. Ultrasound waves are generated using a piezoelectric source to the model of the airway and received by piezoelectric receivers on the opposite side. Energy, the area under the curve, and the peak value of the received signal, are used to detect the airway occlusion.\nThe amount of reflected ultrasonic energy from the phantom model of the airway back to the transmitting transducer reduces as the airway model occlusion increases. Also, transmitted signal through the airway model increases as the amount occlusion of the airway model increases.\nThe results of this study support the hypothesis that it is feasible to use ultrasonic pulses to detect partial and full upper airway occlusion.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2017-09-02", "authors": ["MohammadAl-Abed", "PeterAntich", "Donald EWatenpaugh", "KhosrowBehbehani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.08.019"}

Many preclinical research techniques require the use of accurate needle deliveries to soft tissues, including brain tissue. Soft tissues are optimally visualized in MR images, which offer high-soft tissue contrast, as well as a range of unique imaging techniques, including functional, spectroscopy and thermal imaging, however, there are currently no solutions for delivering needles to small animal brains inside the bore of an ultra-high field MR scanner. This paper describes the mechatronic design, evaluation of MR compatibility, registration technique, mechanical calibration, the quantitative validation of the in-bore image-guided needle targeting accuracy and repeatability, and demonstrated the system's ability to deliver needles in situ.\nOur six degree-of-freedom, MR compatible, mechatronic system was designed to fit inside the bore of a 9.4 T MR scanner and is actuated using a combination of piezoelectric and hydraulic mechanisms. The MR compatibility and targeting accuracy of the needle delivery system are evaluated to ensure that the system is precisely calibrated to perform the needle targeting procedures. A semi-automated image registration is performed to link the robot coordinates to the MR coordinate system. Soft tissue targets can be accurately localized in MR images, followed by automatic alignment of the needle trajectory to the target. Intra-procedure visualization of the needle target location and the needle were confirmed through MR images after needle insertion.\nThe effects of geometric distortions and signal noise were found to be below threshold that would have an impact on the accuracy of the system. The system was found to have negligible effect on the MR image signal noise and geometric distortion. The system was mechanically calibrated and the mean image-guided needle targeting and needle trajectory accuracies were quantified in an image-guided tissue mimicking phantom experiment to be 178 \u00b1 54 \u03bcm and 0.27 \u00b1 0.65\u00b0, respectively.\nAn MR image-guided system for in-bore needle deliveries to soft tissue targets in small animal models has been developed.

We fabricated carbon fibre-reinforced polymer panels equipped with embedded microstructured optical fibre sensors and experimentally demonstrated the strain waves associated with the propagating Lamb waves in both the axial and transverse directions of the optical fibre.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-25", "authors": ["BenDe Pauw", "SidneyGoossens", "ThomasGeernaert", "DimitriosHabas", "HugoThienpont", "FrancisBerghmans"], "doi": "10.3390/s17091948\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/4/032\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/6/309\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.01.020\n10.1109/JLT.2005.862442\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2005.07.014\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/4/009\n10.1016/S1359-835X(02)00036-2\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/1/015007\n10.1299/jsmea.46.620\n10.1088/1674-1056/20/9/094301\n10.1002/lpor.200810034\n10.1155/2009/871580\n10.1155/2008/239417\n10.1002/lpor.200810010\n10.1155/2012/598178\n10.1088/0964-1726/24/5/055003\n10.3390/s110302566\n10.1364/OE.21.020404\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/10/105026\n10.1088/0964-1726/23/7/075007"}

This can be attributed to defect accumulation at the grain surfaces and at grain boundaries and the associated density of carriers.

{"title": "Critical Interface States Controlling Rectification of Ultrathin NiO-ZnO p-n Heterojunctions.", "abstract": "Herein, we consider the heterojunction formation of two prototypical metal oxides: p-type NiO and n-type ZnO. Elementally abundant, low-cost metal oxide/oxide' heterojunctions are of interest for UV optical sensing, gas sensing, photocatalysis, charge confinement layers, piezoelectric nanogenerators, and flash memory devices. These heterojunctions can also be used as current rectifiers and potentially as recombination layers in tandem photovoltaic stacks by making the two oxide layers ultrathin. In the ultrathin geometry, understanding and control of interface electronic structure and chemical reactions at the oxide/oxide' interface are critical to functionality, as oxygen atoms are shared at the interface of the dissimilar materials. In the studies presented here the extent of chemical reactions and interface band bending is monitored using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies. Interface reactivity is controlled by varying the near surface composition of nickel oxide, nickel hydroxide, and nickel oxyhydroxide using standard surface-treatment procedures. A direct correlation between relative percentage of interface hydroxyl chemistry (and hence surface Lewis basicity) and the local band edge alignment for ultrathin p-n junctions (6 nm NiO/30 nm ZnO) is observed. We propose an acid-base formulism to explain these results: the stronger the acid-base reaction, the greater the fraction of interfacial electronic states which lower the band offset between the ZnO conduction band and the NiO valence band. Increased interfacial gap states result in larger reverse bias current of the p-n junction and lower rectification ratios. The acid-base formulism could serve as a future design principle for oxide/oxide' and other heterojunctions based on dissimilar materials.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-08-24", "authors": ["K XerxesSteirer", "Kai LinOu", "Neal RArmstrong", "Erin LRatcliff"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b08899"}

As a result, antennas typically have a size greater than one-tenth of the wavelength, and further miniaturization of antennas has been an open challenge for decades. Here we report on acoustically actuated nanomechanical magnetoelectric (ME) antennas with a suspended ferromagnetic/piezoelectric thin-film heterostructure. These ME antennas receive and transmit electromagnetic waves through the ME effect at their acoustic resonance frequencies. The bulk acoustic waves in ME antennas stimulate magnetization oscillations of the ferromagnetic thin film, which results in the radiation of electromagnetic waves. Vice versa, these antennas sense the magnetic fields of electromagnetic waves, giving a piezoelectric voltage output. The ME antennas (with sizes as small as one-thousandth of a wavelength) demonstrates 1-2 orders of magnitude miniaturization over state-of-the-art compact antennas without performance degradation. These ME antennas have potential implications for portable wireless communication systems.The miniaturization of antennas beyond a wavelength is limited by designs which rely on electromagnetic resonances.

Herein, surface selective crosslinking of copper oxide-polyphosphoester (CuO-PPE) hybrid nanogels on to polyvinylidene fluoride-styrene maleic anhydride (PVDF/SMA) ultrafiltration membranes was developed. The hybrid nanogels, composed of PPE and CuO, with inherent antifouling and antibacterial properties, were crosslinked using a macroinitiator (polyethylene glycol, PEG) and subsequently grafted on to PVDF/SMA by alkyne-anhydride reaction. Partially hydrolysed SMA solubilizes membrane proteins and the phosphatase/phospholipase triggers the cleavage of PPE segments resulting in controlled release of Cu ions. This unique strategy renders the membrane surface antibacterial through sustained and controlled release of Cu ions thereby generating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, the enhanced antibiofouling performance of these membranes is facilitated by the presence of the hydrophilic macroinitiator (PEG and PPE). The modified membranes designed in this study are durable and possess long-term stability due to strong covalent interaction between CuO-PPE and the PVDF/SMA membrane. Studies on the flux, porosity and protein adsorption of the membranes were performed. An enhanced flux recovery ratio was observed for the modified membrane due to the pendant PPE groups (from CuO-PPE) which prohibit irreversible protein adsorption on the PVDF surface. The cytotoxicity of CuO-PPE is greatly reduced because of an effective coverage of CuO by biocompatible PPEs.

To this end, Euler-Bernoulli theory was used to model the vibrating behavior of piezoelectric MC with added mass at its free end. Frequency analysis was conducted by considering geometric discontinuities and taking added mass into account. The effect of liquid environment applied to the MC (as hydrodynamic forces) was based on a string of spheres model. Since changes in resonance frequency are used as the measurement parameter in mass sensors, changes in resonance frequency during absorption of nanoparticles was selected as the main parameter to be investigated in this study. Ultimately, with the aim to achieve optimal geometric dimensions for the piezoelectric MC, sensitivity analysis was additionally performed in order to increase the frequency sensitivity. According to the results, frequency sensitivity of the piezoelectric MC decreased in liquid environment compared to air environments. Moreover, increases in fluid density and viscosity caused a decreased frequency sensitivity.

{"title": "Multiphysics Simulation of Low-Amplitude Acoustic Wave Detection by Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors Validated by In-Situ AE-Fatigue Experiment.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are commonly used for detecting Lamb waves for structural health monitoring application. However, in most applications of active sensing, the signals are of high-amplitude and easy to detect. In this article, we have shown a new avenue of using the PWAS transducer for detecting the low-amplitude fatigue-crack related acoustic emission (AE) signals. Multiphysics finite element (FE) simulations were performed with two PWAS transducers bonded to the structure. Various configurations of the sensors were studied by using the simulations. One PWAS was placed near to the fatigue-crack and the other one was placed at a certain distance from the crack. The simulated AE event was generated at the crack tip. The simulation results showed that both PWAS transducers were capable of sensing the AE signals. To validate the multiphysics simulation results, an in-situ AE-fatigue experiment was performed.

{"title": "Low-Frequency and Broadband Vibration Energy Harvesting Using Base-Mounted Piezoelectric Transducers.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters often consist of a cantilevered beam composed of a support layer and one or two piezoelectric layers with a tip mass. While this configuration is advantageous for maximizing electromechanical coupling, the mechanical properties of the piezoelectric material can place limitations on harvester size and resonant frequency. Here, we present numerical and experimental results from a new type of piezoelectric energy harvester in which the mechanical properties and the resonant frequency of the cantilever beam resonator are effectively decoupled from the piezoelectric component. Referred to as a base-mounted piezoelectric (BMP) harvester in this paper, this new design features a piezoelectric transducer mounted beneath the base of the cantilevered beam resonator. The flexibility in the material choice for the cantilever beam resonator means that the resonant frequency and the beam dimensions are essentially free parameters. A prototype made with a 1.6 mm mm mm polyurethane beam, a PZT-5H piezoelectric transducer, and an 8.36-g tip mass is shown to produce an average power of 8.75 and at 45 Hz across a 13.0- load under harmonic base excitations of constant peak acceleration at 0.25 and 1.0-g, respectively. We also show an increase in full-width half-maximum bandwidth approximately from 1.5 to 5.6 Hz using an array of four individual BMP harvesters of similar dimensions with peak power generation of at 37.6 Hz across a 1.934- load at 0.25-g peak base excitation. Finite elements-based numerical simulations are shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results, indicating that the harvester behaves like a damped mass-spring system as proposed in this paper.

Therefore, prevention and treatment of dysphagia would contribute to extending healthy-life and QOL of elderly people and decreasing healthcare cost. Robotics technologies are expected as one of the effective methods to solve the problem in terms of detecting malfunction in swallowing and recovering swallowing function. The aim of this study is to investigate muscle activity during normal swallowing using mechanomyography (MMG) with PolyVinylidene DiFluoride (PVDF) film which is a ferroelectrics polymer. Measurement of MMG signal during voluntary isometric contraction of the biceps brachii muscle was conducted to confirm whether PVDF film can detect MMG signal. In the experiment, surface electromyography (sEMG) was also measured as a reference to estimate muscle activity for comparison. Then, activities of swallowing muscles during normal swallowing with different volume of bolus were measured using MMG signal. As the result, it was confirmed that swallowing activity can be quantified by the detected MMG signal from different region of neck.", "journal": "IEEE ...

Our aim was to quantify in vivo longitudinal changes in mesh shape and geometry in a large animal model. We compare two commonly used mesh shapes, armed and flat, that are differently affixed. The secondary outcomes were active and passive biomechanical properties.\nA total of 18 animals were used. Six each were implanted with either an arm mesh, a flat mesh or underwent a sham surgery. PVDF meshes loaded with Fe\nMR images of 5 animals in each group were used for longitudinal comparison. Compared to the initial implant size, there was an immediate drop in the ESA measurement at day 2 of almost 32.22 [7.06] % (median [IQR]) for flat meshes, and by 17.59 [6.50] % for arm meshes. After 14 days, the reduction in area was 41.84 [14.89] % and 27.18 [20.44] %, and at day 60 it was 36.61 [6.64] % and 26.43 [14.56] % for the flat and armed meshes respectively. The reduction in area in the two groups was different between the two groups only day 14 (p = 0.046). The ellipticity of the arms was 0.81 [0.08] (median [IQR]) and there was no significant change in the ellipticity profiles over time. The mesh arm length did not change significantly over time. The part comparison showed a maximum difference of 4.26 [3.29] mm in 3D models according to the MHD measure, which is clinically not relevant. Comparison of high thickness areas on the thickness maps correlated well with the areas of mesh folding in the arm mesh group observed during postmortem dissection. Thickness maps did not help us understand why the flat meshes had a reduction in support area. The comfort zone stiffness of the flat mesh and of the central part of the arm mesh were 2.4 fold and 4.5 times stiffer compared to sham groups, respectively. The arms were 36% stiffer than the central part of the mesh. The comfort zone length of the sham group was 46% longer than the flat mesh group (p = 0.027) and 59% longer than that of the central part of the arm mesh (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in vaginal contractile forces generated in samples from the arm, flat mesh, and sham groups.\nThis is a first longitudinal study observing deformations in vaginally implanted synthetic meshes in a large animal model. A novel methodology is presented to calculate the area of the vaginal tissue effectively supported by the mesh implant. Immediately post-operatively, a reduction in 32% and 17% was noted, which remained stable over the 60 following days of observation. We use thickness maps to analyze the cause of this dramatic immediate reduction. In the armed mesh we found it to be mesh folding at the interface between the arms and central part.

{"title": "Electromechanical Coupling of Murine Lung Tissues Probed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy.", "abstract": "Elastin is a major constituent of lung that makes up approximately 30% of lung's dry weight, and the piezoelectricity of elastin is expected to be exhibited in lung tissues. Because hundreds of millions of cycles of inhalation and exhalation occur in one's lifetime, such piezoelectric effect leads to hundreds of millions of cycles of charge generations in lung tissues, suggesting possible physiological significance. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we show that the murine lung tissues are indeed piezoelectric, exhibiting predominantly first harmonic piezoresponse in both vertical and lateral modes. The second harmonic response, which could arise from ionic motions, electrochemical dipoles, and electrostatic interactions, is found to be small. The mappings of amplitude, phase, resonance frequency, and quality factor of both vertical and lateral PFM are also obtained, showing small fluctuation in frequency, but larger variation in quality factor, and thus energy dissipation. The phase mapping is confined in a small range, indicating a polar distribution with preferred orientation. It is also found that the polarity of the electromechanical coupling in lung tissues can be switched by an external electric field, resulting in characteristic hysteresis and butterfly loops, with a presence of internal bias in the polar structure. It is hypothesized that the piezoelectric charge generation during inhalation and exhalation could play a role in binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, and the polarity switching can help damp out the possible sudden increase in air pressure. We hope such observation of piezoelectricity and its polarity switching in lung lay the foundation for the subsequent studies of its physiological significance.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2017-08-14", "authors": ["PengJiang", "FeiYan", "EhsanNasr Esfahani", "ShuhongXie", "DaifengZou", "XiaoyanLiu", "HairongZheng", "JiangyuLi"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00107"}

In recent years, its reversible wettability has also attracted increasing interest. The wettability of ZnO nanostructures with various morphologies has been studied. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of investigations on further modifications on ZnO to provide more benefits than pristine ZnO. Comprehensive studies on the reversible wettability are still needed. In this study, a ZnO nanorod array was prepared via a hydrothermal process and subsequently coated with thin gold layers with varied thickness. The morphologies and structures, optical properties and wettability were investigated. It is revealed that the ZnO-Au system possesses recoverable wettability upon switching between visible-ultraviolet light and a dark environment, which is verified by the contact angle change. The introduction of the thin gold layer to the ZnO nanorod array effectively increases the recovery rate of the wettability. The improvements are attributed to the hierarchical structures, which are formed by depositing thin gold layers onto the ZnO nanorod array, the visible light sensitivity due to the plasmonic effect of the deposited gold, as well as the fast charge-induced surface status change upon light illumination or dark storage.

This study presents an efficient method for remotely measuring heart rate and respiratory rate from video captured by a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UVA). The proposed method estimates heart rate and respiratory rate based on the acquired signals obtained from video-photoplethysmography that are synchronous with cardiorespiratory activity.\nSince the PPG signal is highly affected by the noise variations (illumination variations, subject's motions and camera movement), we have used advanced signal processing techniques, including complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to remove noise under these assumptions.\nTo evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method, a set of experiments were performed on 15 healthy volunteers in a front-facing position involving motion resulting from both the subject and the UAV under different scenarios and different lighting conditions.\nThe experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system with and without the magnification process achieves robust and accurate readings and have significant correlations compared to a standard pulse oximeter and Piezo respiratory belt. Also, the squared correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and mean error rate yielded by the proposed method with and without the magnification process were significantly better than the state-of-the-art methodologies, including independent component analysis (ICA) and principal component analysis (PCA).", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2017-08-10", "authors": ["AliAl-Naji", "Asanka GPerera", "JavaanChahl"], "doi": "10.1186/s12938-017-0395-y\n10.1371/journal.pone.0071384\n10.1364/BOE.6.001565\n10.1016/j.bspc.2014.03.004\n10.1088/0967-3334/35/9/1913\n10.1088/0967-3334/37/5/N27\n10.3390/s17020286\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2006.09.006\n10.1364/OE.16.021434\n10.1109/TBME.2010.2086456\n10.1142/S0219467817500012\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2266196\n10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2364415\n10.1109/JSEN.2014.2347397\n10.1049/iet-ipr.2016.0569\n10.1016/j.bspc.2014.06.009\n10.1142/S1793536909000047\n10.1109/TSP.2009.2021636\n10.1109/TNN.2007.894017\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2506982\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2225427\n10.1109/JSEN.2015.2490038\n10.1016/S0169-7439(03)00113-8\n10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.10.001"}

Inhomogeneous domains of phase grating are produced by operating the transducers at different phase shifts, resulting in two-dimensional index modulation of periodic and sinc function profiles. Also different phase shifts provide a mechanism to steer the grating lobe in various directions and, therefore, the incident angle of the laser beam on the grating plane is automatically modified without moving the beam. Additionally, the acoustic frequency can be varied to achieve the Bragg condition for the new incident angle of the laser beam so that the diffraction efficiency of the deflector is maximized. The Gaussian beam is expressed in terms of planes and the second order coupled mode theory is implemented to analyze the diffraction of the beam. The diffraction efficiency is found to be nearly unity for optimal operating parameters of the acousto-optic device.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2017-08-10", "authors": ["TiansiWang", "ChongZhang", "AleksandarAleksov", "IslamSalama", "AravindaKar"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.25.016002"}

Regarding the band-to-band properties, we discuss the variation of the screening of the internal electric field by free carriers, as a function of the doping density and well/nanodisk size. We observe that nanowire heterostructures consistently present longer photoluminescence decay times than their planar counterparts, which supports the existence of an in-plane piezoelectric field associated to the shear component of the strain tensor in the nanowire geometry. Regarding the ISB characteristics, we report absorption covering 1.45-1.75 \u03bcm using Ge-doped quantum wells, with comparable performance to Si-doped planar heterostructures. We also report similar ISB absorption in Si- and Ge-doped nanowire heterostructures indicating that the choice of dopant is not an intrinsic barrier for observing ISB phenomena.

This study identifies some challenges associated with the potential impacts of indoor air contaminants on ionization and analysis involving open-air methods.\nUnexpected effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from floor maintenance activities on ambient ionization mass spectrometry were studied using three different ambient ionization techniques. Extractive electrospray ionization (EESI), direct analysis in real time (DART) and ionization by piezoelectric direct discharge (PDD) plasma were demonstrated in this study to be affected by indoor air contaminants. Identification of contaminant vapors was verified by comparison with standards using EESI-MS/MS product ion scans.\nEmissions of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether are identified from floor stripping and waxing solutions using three ambient ionization mass spectrometry techniques. These unexpected indoor air contaminants are capable of more than 75% ion suppression of target analytes due to their high volatility, proton affinity and solubility compared with the target analytes. The contaminant vapors are also shown to form adducts with one of the target analytes.\nThe common practice in MS analysis of subtracting a background air spectrum may not be appropriate if the presence of ionizable air contaminants alters the spectrum in unexpected ways.

GsMTx4 had been used for years to investigate the functional role of cationic MSCs, especially in muscle tissue, but with little understanding of its target or inhibitory mechanism. The sensitivity of Piezo channels to bilayer stress and its robust mechanosensitivity when expressed in heterologous systems were keys to determining GsMTx4's mechanism of action. However, questions remain regarding Piezo's role in muscle function due to the non-selective nature of GsMTx4 inhibition toward membrane mechanoenzymes and the implication of MCS channel types by genetic knockdown. Evidence supporting Piezo like activity, at least in the developmental stages of muscle, is presented. While the MSC targets of GsMTx4 in muscle pathology are unclear, its muscle protective effects are clearly demonstrated in two recent in situ studies on normal cardiomyocytes and dystrophic skeletal muscle.

{"title": "An analysis of signal processing algorithm performance for cortical intrinsic optical signal imaging and strategies for algorithm selection.", "abstract": "Intrinsic Optical Signal (IOS) imaging has been used extensively to examine activity-related changes within the cerebral cortex. A significant technical challenge with IOS imaging is the presence of large noise, artefact components and periodic interference. Signal processing is therefore important in obtaining quality IOS imaging results. Several signal processing techniques have been deployed, however, the performance of these approaches for IOS imaging has never been directly compared. The current study aims to compare signal processing techniques that can be used when quantifying stimuli-response IOS imaging data. Data were gathered from the somatosensory cortex of mice following piezoelectric stimulation of the hindlimb. The effectiveness of each technique to remove noise and extract the IOS signal was compared for both spatial and temporal responses. Careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each method were carried out to inform the choice of signal processing for IOS imaging. We conclude that spatial Gaussian filtering is the most effective choices for improving the spatial IOS response, whilst temporal low pass and bandpass filtering produce the best results for producing temporal responses when periodic stimuli are an option. Global signal regression and truncated difference also work well and do not require periodic stimuli.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["J ATurley", "KZalewska", "MNilsson", "F RWalker", "S JJohnson"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-06864-y\n10.1177/1073858409333076\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.04.041\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.001272\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.06.021\n10.3389/fnins.2014.00211\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.02.025\n10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00403-3\n10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00221-1\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.01.043\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.04.024\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.05.051\n10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.07.008\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.036\n10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00286-1\n10.1006/nimg.2000.0547\n10.1006/nimg.2000.0551\n10.1006/nimg.2001.0950"}
{"title": "An Advanced Multi-Sensor Acousto-Ultrasonic Structural Health Monitoring System: Development and Aerospace Demonstration.", "abstract": "A key longstanding objective of the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) research community is to enable the embedment of SHM systems in high value assets like aircraft to provide on-demand damage detection and evaluation. As against traditional non-destructive inspection hardware, embedded SHM systems must be compact, lightweight, low-power and sufficiently robust to survive exposure to severe in-flight operating conditions. Typical Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems can be bulky, costly and are often inflexible in their configuration and/or scalability, which militates against in-service deployment. Advances in electronics have resulted in ever smaller, cheaper and more reliable components that facilitate the development of compact and robust embedded SHM systems, including for Acousto-Ultrasonics (AU), a guided plate-wave inspection modality that has attracted strong interest due mainly to its capacity to furnish wide-area diagnostic coverage with a relatively low sensor density. This article provides a detailed description of the development, testing and demonstration of a new AU interrogation system called the Acousto Ultrasonic Structural health monitoring Array Module\u207a (AUSAM\u207a). This system provides independent actuation and sensing on four Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensor (PWAS) elements with further sensing on four Positive Intrinsic Negative (PIN) photodiodes for intensity-based interrogation of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG). The paper details the development of a novel piezoelectric excitation amplifier, which, in conjunction with flexible acquisition-system architecture, seamlessly provides electromechanical impedance spectroscopy for PWAS diagnostics over the full instrument bandwidth of 50 KHz-5 MHz.

{"title": "Strain Wave Acquisition by a Fiber Optic Coherent Sensor for Impact Monitoring.", "abstract": "A novel fiber optic sensing technology for high frequency dynamics detection is proposed in this paper, specifically tailored for structural health monitoring applications based on strain wave analysis, for both passive impact identification and active Lamb wave monitoring. The sensing solution relies on a fiber optic-based interferometric architecture associated to an innovative coherent detection scheme, which retrieves in a completely passive way the high-frequency phase information of the received optical signal. The sensing fiber can be arranged into different layouts, depending on the requirement of the specific application, in order to enhance the sensor sensitivity while still ensuring a limited gauge length if punctual measures are required. For active Lamb wave monitoring, this results in a sensing fiber arranged in multiple loops glued on an aluminum thin panel in order to increase the phase signal only in correspondence to the sensing points of interest. Instead, for passive impact identification, the required sensitivity is guaranteed by simply exploiting a longer gauge length glued to the structure. The fiber optic coherent (FOC) sensor is exploited to detect the strain waves emitted by a piezoelectric transducer placed on the aluminum panel or generated by an impulse hammer, respectively. The FOC sensor measurements have been compared with both a numerical model based on Finite Elements and traditional piezoelectric sensors, confirming a good agreement between experimental and simulated results for both active and passive impact monitoring scenarios.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["ClaudioSbarufatti", "AlessioBeligni", "AndreaGilioli", "MaddalenaFerrario", "MarcoMattarei", "MarioMartinelli", "MarcoGiglio"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10070794\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.06.010\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2011.08.003\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2010.01.007\n10.1002/stc.1492\n10.1080/09243046.2012.736346\n10.1111/j.1475-1305.2001.tb01254.x\n10.1016/S0263-2241(98)00036-0\n10.1121/1.2400668\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.926894\n10.1088/0964-1726/11/6/314\n10.1088/0964-1726/12/1/314\n10.1364/OE.21.010697\n10.1109/TUFFC.2005.1406556\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/5/020\n10.1088/1742-6596/628/1/012118\n10.1109/JLT.2009.2028656\n10.1364/AOP.1.000279\n10.1364/AO.19.002926\n10.1109/19.543989\n10.1016/0030-4018(89)90436-7\n10.1109/JSEN.2009.2020244\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/002"}

Guided waves are advantageous for structural health monitoring due to their slow geometrical decay of amplitude with propagating distance, which is ideal for rapid wide-area inspection. This paper presents a 3D laser vibrometry experimental and finite element analysis of the interaction between an edge-guided wave and a small through-thickness hidden edge crack on a racecourse shaped hole that occurs, in practice, as a fuel vent hole. A piezoelectric transducer is bonded on the straight edge of the hole to generate the incident wave. The excitation signal consists of a 5.5 cycle Hann-windowed tone burst of centre frequency 220 kHz, which is below the cut-off frequency for the first order Lamb wave modes (SH1). Two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation (2D FFT) is applied to the incident and scattered wave field along radial lines emanating from the crack mouth, so as to identify the wave modes and determine their angular variation and amplitude. It is shown experimentally and computationally that mid-plane symmetric edge waves can travel around the hole's edge to detect a hidden crack.

{"title": "Early Damage Detection in Composites during Fabrication and Mechanical Testing.", "abstract": "Fully integrated monitoring systems have shown promise in improving confidence in composite materials while reducing lifecycle costs. A distributed optical fibre sensor is embedded in a fibre reinforced composite laminate, to give three sensing regions at different levels through-the-thickness of the plate. This study follows the resin infusion process during fabrication of the composite, monitoring the development of strain in-situ and in real time, and to gain better understanding of the resin rheology during curing. Piezoelectric wafer active sensors and electrical strain gauges are bonded to the plate after fabrication. This is followed by progressive loading/unloading cycles of mechanical four point bending. The strain values obtained from the optical fibre are in good agreement with strain data collected by surface mounted strain gauges, while the sensing regions clearly indicate the development of compressive, neutral, and tensile strain.

{"title": "On-Line Multi-Damage Scanning Spatial-Wavenumber Filter Based Imaging Method for Aircraft Composite Structure.", "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) of aircraft composite structure is helpful to increase reliability and reduce maintenance costs. Due to the great effectiveness in distinguishing particular guided wave modes and identifying the propagation direction, the spatial-wavenumber filter technique has emerged as an interesting SHM topic. In this paper, a new scanning spatial-wavenumber filter (SSWF) based imaging method for multiple damages is proposed to conduct on-line monitoring of aircraft composite structures. Firstly, an on-line multi-damage SSWF is established, including the fundamental principle of SSWF for multiple damages based on a linear piezoelectric (PZT) sensor array, and a corresponding wavenumber-time imaging mechanism by using the multi-damage scattering signal. Secondly, through combining the on-line multi-damage SSWF and a PZT 2D cross-shaped array, an image-mapping method is proposed to conduct wavenumber synthesis and convert the two wavenumber-time images obtained by the PZT 2D cross-shaped array to an angle-distance image, from which the multiple damages can be directly recognized and located. In the experimental validation, both simulated multi-damage and real multi-damage introduced by repeated impacts are performed on a composite plate structure. The maximum localization error is less than 2 cm, which shows good performance of the multi-damage imaging method. Compared with the existing spatial-wavenumber filter based damage evaluation methods, the proposed method requires no more than the multi-damage scattering signal and can be performed without depending on any wavenumber modeling or measuring. Besides, this method locates multiple damages by imaging instead of the geometric method, which helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, it can be easily applied to on-line multi-damage monitoring of aircraft composite structures.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-08-05", "authors": ["YuanqiangRen", "LeiQiu", "ShenfangYuan", "QiaoBao"], "doi": "10.3390/ma10050519\n10.1016/j.msea.2005.08.064\n10.1088/0964-1726/18/7/074002\n10.3390/ma9110894\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/4/045022\n10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/302\n10.1016/j.ultras.2012.12.015\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.06.017\n10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1792\n10.1177/1475921713479643\n10.1007/s10921-007-0027-8\n10.1177/1045389X11421821\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/2/020\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055018\n10.1177/1475921709352145\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.02.001\n10.3390/ma9110901\n10.1177/1045389X14549873\n10.1016/j.ultras.2007.10.008\n10.1016/j.ultras.2008.07.019\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/2/025002\n10.1016/j.sna.2014.04.027\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.413-414.811\n10.1177/1475921710379512\n10.1177/1475921716636375\n10.1109/TUFFC.2015.2496423\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045017\n10.1016/j.ast.2016.04.014\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.05.041\n10.3390/s16091511\n10.1177/1045389X10372003\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.04.062\n10.1121/1.2804699\n10.1016/j.sna.2009.02.032"}

The experimental results show that the vapor pressure effect and the plasma pressure effect in the process of pulsed laser irradiation lead to the splashing of high temperature and high density melt. With the decrease of the laser wavelength, the laser breakdown threshold decreases and the shock wave is weakened. Because of the pressure effect of the laser shock, the brittle fracture zone is at the edge of the irradiated area. The surface tension gradient and surface shear wave caused by the surface wave are the result of coherent coupling between optical and thermodynamics.

{"title": "Fabrication of Lead-Free Bi", "abstract": "Piezoelectric ceramics are widely used in actuator applications, and currently the vast majority of these devices are based on Pb ( Zr , Ti ) O 3 , which constitutes environmental and health hazards due to the toxicity of lead. One of the most promising lead-free material systems for actuators is based on Bi 0 . 5 Na 0 . 5 TiO 3 (BNT), and here we report on successful fabrication of BNT thin films by aqueous chemical solution deposition. The precursor solution used in the synthesis is based on bismuth citrate stabilized by ethanolamine, NaOH , and a Ti-citrate prepared from titanium tetraisopropoxide and citric acid. BNT thin films were deposited on SrTiO 3 and platinized silicon substrates by spin-coating, and the films were pyrolized and annealed by rapid thermal processing. The BNT perovskite phase formed after calcination at 500 \u00b0C in air.

General equations of input displacement, output displacement, displacement amplification, input stiffness, output stiffness and stress are presented. Using the established equations, a piezo-driven compliant bridge mechanism has been optimized to maximize displacement amplification. The presented equations were verified using both computational finite element analysis and through experimentation.

{"title": "Spreading Dynamics of Molten Polymer Drops on Glass Substrates.", "abstract": "Wetting dynamics drive numerous processes involving liquids in contact with solid substrates with a wide range of geometries. The spreading dynamics of organic liquids and liquid metals at, respectively, room temperature and >1000 \u00b0C have been studied extensively, both experimentally and numerically; however, almost no attention has been paid to the wetting behavior of molten drops of thermoplastic polymers, despite its importance, for example, in the processing of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Indeed, the ability of classical theories of dynamic wetting, that is, the hydrodynamic and the molecular-kinetic theories, to model these complex liquids is unknown. We have therefore investigated the spreading dynamics on glass, over temperatures between 200 and 260 \u00b0C, of two thermoplastics: polypropylene (PP) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). PP and PVDF showed, respectively, the highest and lowest slip lengths due to their different interactions with the glass substrate. The jump lengths of PP and PVDF are comparable to their Kuhn segment lengths, suggesting that the wetting process of these polymers is mediated by segmental displacements. The present work not only provides evidence of the suitability of the classical models to model dynamic wetting of molten polymers but also advances our understanding of the wetting dynamics of molten thermoplastics at the liquid/solid interface.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2017-08-03", "authors": ["YichuanZhang", "Carlos AFuentes", "RobinKoekoekx", "ChristianClasen", "Aart WVan Vuure", "Jo\u00eblDe Coninck", "DavidSeveno"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b01500"}
{"title": "Cloning Mice.", "abstract": "Viable and fertile mice can be generated by somatic nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes, presumably because the transplanted somatic cell genome becomes reprogrammed by factors in the oocyte. The first somatic cloned offspring of mice were obtained by directly injecting donor nuclei into recipient enucleated oocytes. When this method is used (the so-called Honolulu method of somatic cell nuclear transfer [SCNT]), the donor nuclei readily and completely condense within the enucleated metaphase II-arrested oocytes, which contain high levels of M-phase-promoting factor (MPF). It is believed that the condensation of the donor chromosomes promotes complete reprogramming of the donor genome within the mouse oocytes. Another key to the success of mouse cloning is the use of blunt micropipettes attached to a piezo impact-driving micromanipulation device. This system saves a significant amount of time during the micromanipulation of oocytes and thus minimizes the loss of oocyte viability in vitro. For example, a group of 20 oocytes can be enucleated within 10 min by an experienced operator. This protocol is composed of seven parts: (1) preparing micropipettes, (2) setting up the enucleation and injection micropipettes, (3) collecting and enucleating oocytes, (4) preparing nucleus donor cells, (5) injecting donor nuclei, (6) activating embryos and culturing, and (7) transferring cloned embryos.", "journal": "Cold Spring Harbor protocols", "date": "2017-08-03", "authors": ["AtsuoOgura"], "doi": "10.1101/pdb.prot094425"}

The flexible hinge and piezoelectric actuators are analyzed, and a dynamic model of the scanning systems is established. A force sensor and an integral controller are utilized in integral force feedback (IFF) to directly augment the damping of the piezoelectric scanning systems. Hysteresis has been effectively eliminated, but the mechanical resonance is still evident. Noticeable residual vibration occurred after the inflection points and then gradually disappeared. For the further control of mechanical resonance, based on the theory of minimum-acceleration trajectory planning, the time-domain input shaping method was developed. The turning sections of a scanning trajectory are replaced by smooth curves, while the linear sections are retained. The IFF method is combined with the input shaping method to control the non-linearity and mechanical resonance in high-speed piezo-based scanning systems. Experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2017-08-03", "authors": ["MengZhang", "ZhigangLiu", "YuZhu", "MingfanBu", "JunHong"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4993926"}

{"title": "Hysteresis compensation of the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model for piezoelectric actuators using modified particle swarm optimization with chaotic map.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators invariably exhibit hysteresis nonlinearities that tend to become significant under the open-loop condition and could cause oscillations and errors in nanometer-positioning tasks. Chaotic map modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is proposed and implemented to identify the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model for piezoelectric actuators. Hysteresis compensation is attained through application of an inverse Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, in which the parameters are formulated based on the original model with chaotic map MPSO. To strengthen the diversity and improve the searching ergodicity of the swarm, an initial method of adaptive inertia weight based on a chaotic map is proposed. To compare and prove that the swarm's convergence occurs before stochastic initialization and to attain an optimal particle swarm optimization algorithm, the parameters of a proportional-integral-derivative controller are searched using self-tuning, and the simulated results are used to verify the search effectiveness of chaotic map MPSO. The results show that chaotic map MPSO is superior to its competitors for identifying the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model and that the inverse Prandtl-Ishlinskii model can provide hysteresis compensation under different conditions in a simple and effective manner.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2017-08-03", "authors": ["ZhiliLong", "RuiWang", "JiwenFang", "XufeiDai", "ZuohuaLi"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4991854"}

Important physical properties, such as surface morphology, wettability, and heat stability were considered for the PET-reinforced PVDF nanofiber (PRPN) hybrid separator. Images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the PRPN hybrid separator had a homogeneous pore size and high porosity. It can wet out in battery electrolytes completely and quickly, satisfying wettability requirements. Moreover, the electrolyte uptake was higher than that of dry-laid and wet-laid nonwovens. For heat stability, no shrink occurred even when the heating temperature reached 135 \u00b0C, demonstrating thermal and dimensional stability. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the PRPN hybrid separator possessed a shutdown temperature of 131 \u00b0C, which is the same as conventional separators. Also, the meltdown temperature reached 252 \u00b0C, which is higher than the shutdown temperature, and thus can protect against internal cell shorts.

Here, a series of programmable actuators fabricated as single- or bilayer elements is described that can reversibly respond to minute concentrations of acetone vapors. By using templates, microchannel structures are replicated onto the surface of two highly elastic polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl alcohol, to induce chiral coiling upon exposure to acetone vapors. The vapomechanical coiling is reversible and can be conducted repeatedly over 100 times without apparent fatigue. If they are immersed in liquid acetone, the actuators are saturated with the solvent and temporarily lose their motility but regain their shape and activity within seconds after the solvent evaporates. The desorption of acetone from the PVDF layer is four times faster than its adsorption, and the actuator composed of a single PVDF layer maintains its ability to move over an acetone-soaked filter paper even after several days.

Noise optimization of the front-end revealed that an impedance-matching optimum exists, which balances the system parasitic capacitances relative to the transducer complex impedance. Optimized design equations compared favorably to simulation results in predicting front-end bandwidth and transducer-referred SNR.

ME voltage coefficient that is the ratio of induced electric field to applied magnetic field is the key parameter of ME coupling strength. It has been known that the ME coupling strength is dictated by the product of the piezoelectric and piezomagnetic coefficients of initial phases. As a result, using the laminates with graded piezoelectric and piezomagnetic parameters are a new pathway to the increase in the ME coupling strength. Recently developed models predict stronger ME interactions in composites based on graded components compared to homogeneous ones. We discuss predicting the ME coupling strength for layered structures of homogeneous and compositionally graded magnetostrictive and piezoelectric components based on the graphs of ME voltage coefficients against composite parameters. For obtaining the graphs, we developed equations for ME output in applied magnetic field for possible modes of operation and layered structure configurations. In particular, our studies have been performed on low-frequency ME coupling, enhanced ME effect in electromechanical resonance (EMR) region for longitudinal and bending modes.

The interdisciplinary field of tissue engineering has great potential in regenerative medicine and might overcome negative side effects in the replacement of damaged organs. In particular, tubular organ structures of the genitourinary tract, such as the ureter and urethra, are challenging because of their complexity and special milieu that gives rise to incrustation, inflammation and stricture formation. Tubular biohybrids were prepared from primary porcine smooth muscle cells embedded in a fibrin gel with a stabilising poly(vinylidene fluoride) mesh. A mechanotransduction was performed automatically with a balloon kyphoplasty catheter. Diffusion of urea and creatinine, as well as the bursting pressure, were measured. Light and electron microscopy were used to visualise cellular distribution and orientation. Histological evaluation revealed a uniform cellular distribution in the fibrin gel. Mechanical stimulation with a stretch of 20% leads to a circumferential orientation of smooth muscle cells inside the matrix and a longitudinal alignment on the outer surface of the tubular structure. Urea and creatinine permeability and bursting pressure showed a non-statistically significant trend towards stimulated tissue constructs. In this proof of concept study, an innovative technique of intraluminal pressure for mechanical stimulation of tubular biohybrids prepared from autologous cells and a composite material induce bi-directional orientation of smooth muscle cells by locally and cyclically applied mechanical tension.

Earlier works have shown that major morphological changes can be achieved when PVDF is dissolved under different conditions with practical applications in membrane distillation and protein attachment. However, no previous report has discussed the effects of dissolution conditions on the performance of PVDF under ultrafiltration, which is one of the most important applications of the polymer. In this work, four different PVDF ultrafiltration membranes were produced from dopes dissolved either by stirring at 24\u00b0C, 90\u00b0C, 120\u00b0C or by sonication. It is shown that dope sonication results in membrane with enhanced thermal and mechanical stability, improved permeate flux during oil emulsion filtration and high flux recovery of \u223c63% after cleaning. As a comparison, flux recovery of only \u223c26% was obtained for the membrane produced from dope dissolved at 24\u00b0C. The outstanding performance of the dope-sonicated membrane was linked to its slightly lower porosity, narrow distribution of small pores and relatively smooth skin layer. Performance parameters for all membranes showed good correlation to porosity suggesting a tool for membrane design achievable by simple variation in the mode of polymer dissolution. The polymer dissolution effect was related to the degree of unfolding of the polymer molecular chains and their entanglements.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2017-07-25", "authors": ["Ikechukwu AIke", "JianhuaZhang", "AndrewGroth", "John DOrbell", "MikelDuke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.05.041"}

The understanding of the origin of the high-performance piezoelectric property remains a challenge mainly due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. We perform in\u00a0situ high-energy x-ray diffraction combined with 2D geometry scattering technology to reveal the underlying mechanism for the perovskite-type lead-based high-performance piezoelectric materials. The direct structural evidence reveals that the electric-field-driven continuous polarization rotation within the monoclinic plane plays a critical role to achieve the giant piezoelectric response. An intrinsic relationship between the crystal structure and piezoelectric performance in perovskite ferroelectrics has been established: A strong tendency of electric-field-driven polarization rotation generates peak piezoelectric performance and vice versa. Furthermore, the monoclinic M_{A} structure is the key feature to superior piezoelectric properties as compared to other structures such as monoclinic M_{B}, rhombohedral, and tetragonal. A high piezoelectric response originates from intrinsic lattice strain, but little from extrinsic domain switching.

{"title": "Mechanosensitive Piezo Channels in the Gastrointestinal Tract.", "abstract": "Sensation of mechanical forces is critical for normal function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and abnormalities in mechanosensation are linked to GI pathologies. In the GI tract there are several mechanosensitive cell types-epithelial enterochromaffin\u00a0cells, intrinsic and extrinsic enteric neurons, smooth muscle cells\u00a0and interstitial cells of Cajal. These cells use mechanosensitive ion channels that respond to mechanical forces by altering transmembrane ionic currents\u00a0in a process called mechanoelectrical coupling. Several mechanosensitive ionic conductances have been identified in the mechanosensory GI cells, ranging from mechanosensitive voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels to the mechanogated ion channels, such as the two-pore domain potassium channels K2P (TREK-1) and nonselective cation channels from the transient receptor potential\u00a0family. The recently discovered Piezo channels are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to cellular mechanosensitivity.

{"title": "In Touch With the Mechanosensitive Piezo Channels: Structure, Ion Permeation, and Mechanotransduction.", "abstract": "Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical forces into biological signals, plays critical roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes in mammals, such as conscious sensing of touch, pain, and sound, as well as unconscious sensing of blood flow-associated shear stress, urine flow, and bladder distention. Among the various molecules involved in mechanotransduction, mechanosensitive (MS) cation channels have long been postulated to represent one critical class of mechanotransducers that directly and rapidly converts mechanical force into electrochemical signals. Despite the awareness of their functional significance, the molecular identities of MS cation channels in mammals had remained elusive for decades till the groundbreaking finding that the Piezo family of genes, including Piezo1 and Piezo2, constitutes their essential components. Since their identification about 6years ago, tremendous progress has been made in understanding their physiological and pathophysiological importance in mechanotransduction and their structure-function relationships of being the prototypic class of mammalian MS cation channels. On the one hand, Piezo proteins have been demonstrated to serve as physiologically and pathophysiologically important mechanotransducers for most,\u00a0if not all, mechanotransduction processes. On the other hand, they have been shown to form a remarkable three-bladed, propeller-shaped homotrimeric channel complex comprising a separable ion-conducting pore module and mechanotransduction modules. In this chapter, we review the major advancements, with a particular focus on the structural and biophysical features that enable Piezo proteins to serve as sophisticated MS cation channels for force sensing, transduction, and ion conduction.", "journal": "Current topics in membranes", "date": "2017-07-22", "authors": ["JGeng", "QZhao", "TZhang", "BXiao"], "doi": "10.1016/bs.ctm.2016.11.006"}
{"title": "The Structural Basis for Sensing by\u00a0the Piezo1 Protein.", "abstract": "Mechanotransduction is one of the processes by which cells sense and convert mechanical stimuli into biological signals. Experimental data from various species have revealed crucial roles for mechanotransduction in organ development and a plethora of physiological activities. Piezo proteins have recently been identified as the long-sought-after mechanically activated cation channels in eukaryotes. The architecture of mouse Piezo1 (mPiezo1) channel determined by cryoelectron microscopic\u00a0single-particle analysis at medium resolution yielded important insights into the mechanical force sensing mechanism. mPiezo1 is found to form a trimeric propeller-like structure with the extracellular domains resembling three distal blades and a central cap. The transmembrane region consists of a central pore module that likely determines the ion-conducting properties of mPiezo1, and three peripheral wings formed by arrays of paired transmembrane helices. Compared with the central pore module, the three distal blades display considerably larger flexibility. In the intracellular region, three long beam-like domains (\u223c80\u00c5 in length) support the whole transmembrane region and connect the mobile peripheral regions to the central pore module. This unique design suggests that the trimeric mPiezo1 may mechanistically function in similar principles as how propellers sense and transduce force to control the ion conductivity.

{"title": "A Tour de Force: The Discovery, Properties, and Function of Piezo Channels.", "abstract": "Mechanical transducers appear throughout cell biology and are used to convert mechanical stress into chemical or electrical signals that allow the cell to respond to environmental changes. In the past six years, a eukaryotic mechanical channel family with two members, Piezo1 and Piezo2, has been identified. Piezo1 was shown to be a cation-selective channel that does not require ancillary proteins for activity. Mouse Piezo1 is large, with over 2500 amino acids, and is not homologous to other ion channels. Both piezo channels have rapid voltage-dependent inactivation with a reversal potential near 0mV. The CryoEm structure of Piezo1 at 4.8\u00c5 shows trimer stoichiometry. Since the discovery of the piezo channels, their roles in the physiological response of cells have started to emerge. Significant progress has been made in understanding the intrinsic properties of the channels and how these properties are modulated by cytoskeletal elements. Specific diseases, such as hereditary xerocytosis affecting red blood cells, have mutations in Piezo1 that alter the cell's response to force, typically slowing inactivation and introducing a latency for activation. A number of physiological functions for piezo channels have been identified. These range from sensing the stiffness of surrounding substrate, to the response to light touch, to serotonin release from the gut.

Here we present a series of processing strategies, adapted from methods used in bulk polymer processing, that allow us to control the solidification of polymer nanostructures. First, we show that supramolecular nucleating agents can be readily used to modify the crystallization kinetics of confined poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). In addition, we demonstrate that microstructural features that are not traditionally affected by nucleating agents, such as the orientation of crystals, can be tuned with the crystallization temperature applied. Interestingly, we also show that high crystallization temperatures and long annealing periods induce the formation of the \u03b3 modification of PVDF, hence enabling the simple production of ferro/piezoelectric nanostructures. We anticipate that the approaches presented here can open up a plethora of new possibilities for the processing of polymer-based nanostructures with tailored properties and functionalities.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The temperature sensitivity of this high-frequency quartz resonator is 14\u202f600 Hz/K due to the high phenomenological sensitivity of quartz.

X-ray diffraction and calorimetric experiments on heating reveal that, at 154\u2009\u00b0C, the original mixture between ferroelectric \u03b4-phase and paraelectric \u03b1-phase transits to a system with only this latter phase in the crystalline fraction. A gradual and slight increment of amorphous fraction up to the melting at 161\u2009\u00b0C is also observed.

{"title": "The bone lid technique in oral surgery: a case series study.", "abstract": "The aim of this case series study was to illustrate the bone lid technique implemented using piezoelectric surgery to access mandibular alveolar bone diseases and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes. The technique was used to treat 21 consecutive patients with various conditions: cysts in six cases, impacted teeth with associated cysts in nine, keratocystic odontogenic tumours in three, impacted teeth in two, and an endodontic lesion in one. The bone lid was fashioned using piezoelectric surgery and a thin osteotomy insert. After the surgical procedure, the bone lid was replaced and fixed with miniplates. On clinical and radiological follow-up at 12 months, the outcome measures were bone lid integration and alveolar bone volume recovery. Any complications were also documented. The lesion and bone lid healed completely in 19 cases; one patient experienced permanent mild paresthesia and one experienced trauma-induced bone lid necrosis. Computed tomography volumetric analyses conducted on 11 cases indicated a mean recovery of 93.8% of the volume of bone lost.

Firstly, the composition of the sensor, the spatial layout of force-sensitive components, and measurement principle are analyzed and designed. There is no interference of piezoelectric six-dimensional force sensor in theoretical analysis. Based on the principle of actual work and deformation compatibility coherence, this paper deduces the parallel load sharing principle of the piezoelectric six-dimensional force sensor. The main effect factors which affect the load sharing ratio are obtained. The finite element model of the piezoelectric six-dimensional force sensor is established. In order to verify the load sharing principle of the sensor, a load sharing test device of piezoelectric force sensor is designed and fabricated. The load sharing experimental platform is set up. The experimental results are in accordance with the theoretical analysis and simulation results. The experiments show that the multi-dimensional and heavy force measurement can be realized by the parallel arrangement of the load sharing ring and the force sensitive element in the novel integrated piezoelectric six-dimensional force sensor. The ideal load sharing effect of the sensor can be achieved by appropriate size parameters.

Compared with the derivation of the inverse model analytically from a generalized P-I model, this direct modeling approach has the following advantages. First, direct inverse model identification is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem, which is not subject to the constraint condition on the generalized P-I model's threshold and density functions, where this is indispensable for the analytical model inversion procedure. Second, this approach may be a simple and attractive alternative when the identification precision of a generalized P-I model is limited by the constraint condition, which necessarily results in insufficient hysteresis compensation functionality for the analytically derived inverse model. Finally, direct inverse model identification can overcome the drawbacks of the analytical inversion method, including the accumulation of parameter estimation errors in an analytical inverse model because these parameters are computed from the generalized P-I model's parameters in a recursive manner. Our experimental results demonstrated that the implementation of open-loop control with the directly identified inverse generalized P-I model as a feedforward compensator achieved precise compensation for the asymmetric hysteresis nonlinearities of a piezoelectric stack actuator.", "journal": "ISA transactions", "date": "2017-07-19", "authors": ["Young-RaeKo", "YoonkyuHwang", "MinjiChae", "Tae-HyoungKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isatra.2017.07.004"}

To minimize hardware costs, we employ a single piezoelectric element, mechanically swept across the target scene, and a highly cost-engineered single channel acquisition circuit. Given this constraint, we compare the achievable image quality of a monostatic fixed focus scanner (MFFS) with a monostatic synthetic aperture scanner (MSAS) using postfocusing. Quantitative analysis of image quality was carried out using simulation and phantom experiments, which were used to compare a proof-of-concept MSAS prototype with an MFFS device currently available on the market. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to validate the MSAS prototype in obstetric imaging.\nSimulations show that the achievable lateral resolution of the MSAS approach is superior at all ranges compared to the fixed focus approach. Phantom experiments verify the improved resolution of the MSAS prototype but reveal a lower signal to noise ratio. In vivo experiments show promising results using the MSAS for clinical diagnostics in prenatal care.\nThe proposed MSAS achieves superior resolution but lower SNR compared to an MFFS approach, principally due to lower acoustic energy emitted.\nThe production costs of the proposed MSAS could be an order of magnitude lower than any other ultrasound system on the market today, bringing affordable obstetric imaging a step closer for developing countries.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2017-07-18", "authors": ["Thomas L Avan den Heuvel", "David JGraham", "Kristopher JSmith", "Chris Lde Korte", "Jeffrey ANeasham"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2695240"}

A hopping model, where electron tunnels between bands of localized states, gives appropriate interpretation for temperature-independent PC decay across the temperature range 150-290 K.

Both platinum and iridium oxide top electrodes were examined, and iridium oxide appears to significantly mitigate radiation-induced damage that is observed in platinum top electrode samples. This mitigation of radiation damage is attributed to the reduced number of oxygen vacancies within the PZT films when an iridium oxide top electrode is used. Devices with applied bias during radiation were compared with devices under applied bias only.

For example, when photoacoustic spectroscopy is performed to detect oil-soluble gas in transformers, a micro-cantilever beam can be used to detect gas content. The dynamic characteristics of piezoelectric bimorph beams, such as resonant frequency, are important indexes in the applications of these beams. The equivalent circuit model for a piezoelectric bimorph beam is examined in this study and an admittance test is performed on the beam to accurately, quickly, and economically measure and analyze its dynamic characteristics.

In this paper, based on ab initio calculations, we report a 2D materials system, namely, the recently synthesized Janus MXY (M = Mo or W, X/Y = S, Se, or Te) monolayer and multilayer structures, with large out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. For MXY monolayers, both strong in-plane and much weaker out-of-plane piezoelectric polarizations can be induced by a uniaxial strain in the basal plane. For multilayer MXY, we obtain a very strong out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization when strained transverse to the basal plane, regardless of the stacking sequence.

{"title": "Enhanced piezoresponse of highly aligned electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanofibers.", "abstract": "Well-ordered nanostructure arrays with controlled densities can potentially improve material properties; however, their fabrication typically involves the use of complicated processing techniques. In this work, we demonstrate a uniaxial alignment procedure for fabricating poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) electrospun nanofibers (NFs) by introducing collectors with additional steps. The mechanism of the observed NF alignment, which occurs due to the concentration of lateral electric field lines around collector steps, has been elucidated via finite-difference time-domain simulations. The membranes composed of well-aligned PVDF NFs are characterized by a higher content of the PVDF \u03b2-phase, as compared to those manufactured from randomly orientated fibers. The piezoelectric energy harvester, which was fabricated by transferring well-aligned PVDF NFs onto flexible substrates with Ag electrodes attached to both sides, exhibited a 2-fold increase in the output voltage and a 3-fold increase in the output current as compared to the corresponding values obtained for the device manufactured from randomly oriented NFs. The enhanced piezoresponse observed for the aligned PVDF NFs is due to their higher \u03b2-phase content, denser structure, smaller effective radius of curvature during bending, greater applied strain, and higher fraction of contributing NFs.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2017-07-13", "authors": ["Sung BumKang", "Sang HyukWon", "Min JiIm", "Chan UlKim", "Won IlPark", "Jeong MinBaik", "Kyoung JinChoi"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/aa7f6b"}

However, the fouling and low flux of the polymeric membrane remains the big challenges. Novel modified Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was introduced, in this work, using a novel treatment technique for an electrospun polymeric PVDF membrane to be used in oil/water separation systems. The Characterizations of the modified and pristine membranes showed distinct changes in the phase and crystal structure of the membrane material as well as the wettability. The modification process altered the surface morphology and structure of the membrane by forming hydrophilic microspheres on the membrane surface. Therefore, the proposed treatment converts the membrane from highly hydrophobic to be a superhydrophilic under-oil when wetted with water.

All these issues are addressed in this study and the proposed technique is validated through the \u03b2 measurements of thick solid samples. A simplified self-reciprocity calibration procedure for a broadband receiver is described. The diffraction and attenuation corrections for the fundamental and second harmonics are explicitly derived. Aluminum alloy samples in five different thicknesses (4, 6, 8, 10, 12cm) are prepared and \u03b2 measurements are made using the finite amplitude, through-transmission method.

However, current detection methods cannot meet these clinical requirements because the methods are slow or of low specificity. Consequently, a new highly specific ssDNA aptamer against M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv was selected by using the whole-cell systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technique. The selected aptamer was used to construct a fast and highly specific H37Rv sensor. The probe was produced by immobilizing thiol-modified aptamer on an Au interdigital electrode (Au-IDE) of a multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) through Au-S bonding, and then single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were bonded on the aptamer by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. SWCNTs were used as a signal indicator because of their considerable difference in conductivity compared with H37Rv. When H37Rv is present, it replaces the SWCNTs because it binds to the aptamer much more strongly than SWCNTs do. The replacement of SWCNTs by H37Rv resulted in a large change in the electrical properties, and this change was detected by the MSPQC. The proposed sensor is highly selective and can distinguish H37Rv from Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG). The detection time was 70min and the detection limit was 100cfu/mL.

The membrane is composed of a hydroxyapatite (HAP)-mineralized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane prepared via an interface diffusion-controlled chemical precipitation method. Due to gradient distribution of the HAP nanocrystals across the PVDF membrane, the composite membrane exhibits an asymmetric wetting property where a tiny whole blood droplet (13 \u03bcL) can spontaneously permeate across the membrane within 20 s and red blood cells in the whole blood are successfully blocked by the membrane.

{"title": "Modeling of ultrasonic wave propagation in composite laminates with realistic discontinuity representation.", "abstract": "This paper presents a method for embedding realistic defect geometries of a fiber reinforced material in a finite element modeling environment in order to simulate active ultrasonic inspection. When ultrasonic inspection is used experimentally to investigate the presence of defects in composite materials, the microscopic defect geometry may cause signal characteristics that are difficult to interpret. Hence, modeling of this interaction is key to improve our understanding and way of interpreting the acquired ultrasonic signals. To model the true interaction of the ultrasonic wave field with such defect structures as pores, cracks or delamination, a realistic three dimensional geometry reconstruction is required. We present a 3D-image based reconstruction process which converts computed tomography data in adequate surface representations ready to be embedded for processing with finite element methods. Subsequent modeling using these geometries uses a multi-scale and multi-physics simulation approach which results in quantitative A-Scan ultrasonic signals which can be directly compared with experimental signals. Therefore, besides the properties of the composite material, a full transducer implementation, piezoelectric conversion and simultaneous modeling of the attached circuit is applied. Comparison between simulated and experimental signals provides very good agreement in electrical voltage amplitude and the signal arrival time and thus validates the proposed modeling approach. Simulating ultrasound wave propagation in a medium with a realistic shape of the geometry clearly shows a difference in how the disturbance of the waves takes place and finally allows more realistic modeling of A-scans.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-07-06", "authors": ["Andreea-ManuelaZelenyak", "NoraSchorer", "Markus G RSause"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.06.014"}

The V-shaped transducer consists of two piezoelectric beams connected through a flexible joint to form an appropriate coupling angle. The V-shaped motor is operated in the coupled longitudinal-bending mode. Longitudinal and bending movements are transferred by the flexible joint between the two beams. Compared with the coupled longitudinal-bending mode of the single piezoelectric beam or the symmetrical and asymmetrical modes of the previous V-shaped transducer, the coupled longitudinal-bending mode of the V-shaped transducer with a flexible joint provides higher vibration efficiency and more convenient mode conformance adjustment. A finite element model of the V-shaped transducer is created to numerically study the influence of geometrical parameters and to determine the final geometrical parameters.

This method avoids the need to harvest autogenous bone and the requirement to fix a block with screws, and could help prevent the uncontrolled fracture and avascular necrosis that may result from the traditional alveolar split. Eighteen patients and 43 implants were included in this retrospective study. The width of the alveolar ridge was measured before implantation, immediately after implantation, and after the final restoration. The width increased significantly after the insertion of implants and decreased slightly after bone remodelling. Overall, the width of the alveolar ridge increased by 2.37\u00b11.44mm on average, ranging from -0.20mm to 5.75mm.

This study reports on novel LPAS technique that offers instant and standoff detection capabilities of trace explosives. Over the current study, light is generated using pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser; the generated photoacoustic response in stimulated explosive material offers signature values that depend on the optical, thermal, and acoustical properties. The generated acoustic waves were captured using piezoelectric transducer as well as novel customized optical sensor with remotely laser interferometer probe. A digital signal processing algorithm was employed to identify explosive material signatures via calculation of characteristic optical properties (absorption coefficient), sound velocity, and frequency response of the generated photoacoustic signal. Customized LPAS technique was employed for instantaneous trace detection of three main different high explosive materials including TNT, RDX, and HMX. The main outcome of this study is that the novel customized optical sensor signals were validated with traditional piezoelectric transducer. Furthermore, the customized optical sensor offered standoff detection capabilities (10cm), fast response, high sensitivity, and enhanced signal to noise ratio.

{"title": "Effect of whisker geometry on contact force produced by vibrissae moving at different velocities.", "abstract": "Rats and mice are able to perform a variety of subtle tactile discriminations with their mystacial vibrissae. Increasingly, the design and interpretation of neurophysiological and behavioral studies are inspired by and linked to a more precise understanding of the detailed physical properties of the whiskers and their associated hair follicles. Here we used a piezoelectric sensor (bimorph) to examine how contact forces are influenced by the geometry of individual whisker hairs. For a given point along a whisker, bimorph signals are linearly related to whisker movement velocity. The slope of this linear function, called velocity sensitivity (VS), diminishes nonlinearly as whisker diameter decreases. Whiskers differ in overall length, thickness, and proximal-distal taper. Thus VS varies along an individual whisker and among different whiskers on the mystacial pad. Thinner, shorter whiskers, such as those located rostrally in rats and those in mice, have lower overall VSs, rendering them potentially less effective for mediating discriminations that rely on subtle velocity cues. The nonlinear effect of diameter combined with the linear effect of arc length produces radial distance tuning curves wherein small differences in the proximal-distal location of impacts yields larger differences in signal magnitude. Such position-dependent cues could contribute to the localization of objects near the face. Proximal-to-distal changes in contact location during whisking sweeps could also provide signals that aid texture discrimination.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2017-07-01", "authors": ["George ECarvell", "Daniel JSimons"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.00046.2017\n10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00198-9\n10.1038/nn.3378\n10.1098/rstb.1980.0083\n10.1152/jn.00054.2016\n10.1152/jn.00707.2006\n10.3389/fnbeh.2012.00074\n10.3109/08990229509063138\n10.3109/08990229109144740\n10.1016/j.neuron.2010.02.007\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5008-07.2008\n10.1152/jn.01104.2005\n10.1152/jn.00011.2015\n10.3109/08990220.2014.888993\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1516-06.2006\n10.1152/jn.00574.2012\n10.1080/08990220802467612\n10.1126/science.7123247\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.05.019\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0050015\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3762-09.2010\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4316-12.2013\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.08.027\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1707-12.2014\n10.1002/cne.902520203\n10.1016/j.neuron.2007.12.024\n10.1016/j.tins.2016.04.008\n10.1080/08990220050020580\n10.1016/0006-8993(83)90561-9\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1864-06.2006\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a109950\n10.3758/BF03194861\n10.1093/cercor/bht305\n10.3389/fnint.2015.00053\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008806\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0060215\n10.1016/0006-8993(70)90079-X\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.06.015\n10.1093/cercor/bht241"}

The measured resonant frequency of the developed transducer at 526\u2009MHz is the highest frequency of piezoelectric single crystal based ultrasonic transducers ever reported. This focused UHF ultrasonic transducer exhibits a wide bandwidth (95.5% at -10\u2009dB) due to high attenuation of high-frequency ultrasound wave, which allows the SBAT effectively excite with a wide range of excitation frequency from 150 to 400\u2009MHz by using the \"piezoelectric actuator\" model. Through controlling the excitation frequency, the wavelength of ultrasound emitted from the SBAT can be changed to selectively manipulate a single microparticle of different sizes (3-100\u2009\u03bcm) by using only one transducer. This concept of flexibly changing \"tweezers\" size is firstly introduced into the study of SBAT.

{"title": "Optoelectronic device physics and technology of nitride semiconductors from the UV to the terahertz.", "abstract": "This paper reviews the device physics and technology of optoelectronic devices based on semiconductors of the GaN family, operating in the spectral regions from deep UV to Terahertz. Such devices include LEDs, lasers, detectors, electroabsorption modulators and devices based on intersubband transitions in AlGaN quantum wells (QWs). After a brief history of the development of the field, we describe how the unique crystal structure, chemical bonding, and resulting spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations in heterostructures affect the design, fabrication and performance of devices based on these materials. The heteroepitaxial growth and the formation and role of extended defects are addressed. The role of the chemical bonding in the formation of metallic contacts to this class of materials is also addressed. A detailed discussion is then presented on potential origins of the high performance of blue LEDs and poorer performance of green LEDs (green gap), as well as of the efficiency reduction of both blue and green LEDs at high injection current (efficiency droop).

The time-variant circumferential force from the shrink of piezoelectric ceramic is one of the factors that distort the elastic wave. The distorted waveshape deviates from the ideal standard sinusoidal fashion and affects the contact mechanics and driving performance. An analytical dynamic model of ring ultrasonic motor is developed. Based on this model, the piezoelectric parametric effects on the wave distortion and contact mechanics are examined. Multi-scale method is employed to obtain unstable regions and distorted wave response. The unstable region is verified by Floqu\u00e9t theory. Since the waveshape affects the contact mechanism, a contact model involving the distorted waveshape and normal stiffness of the contact layer is established. The contact model is solved by numerical calculation. The results verify that the deformation of the contact layer deviates from sinusoidal waveshape and the pressure distribution is changed, which influences the output characteristics directly. The surface speed within the contact region is averaged such that the rotor speed decreases for lower torque and increases for larger torque.

{"title": "Determination of absolute material nonlinearity with air-coupled ultrasonic receivers.", "abstract": "Quantitative evaluation of the microstructural state of a specimen can be deduced from knowledge of the sample's absolute acoustic nonlinearity parameter, \u03b2, making the measurement of \u03b2 a powerful tool in the NDE toolbox. However, the various methods used in the past to measure \u03b2 each suffer from significant limitations. Piezoelectric contact transducers are sensitive to nonlinear signals, cheap, and simple to use, but they are hindered by the variability of the interfacial contact between transducer and specimen surface. Laser interferometry provides non-contact detection, but requires carefully prepared specimens or complicated optics to maximize sensitivity to the higher harmonic components of a received waveform. Additionally, laser interferometry is expensive and relatively difficult to use in the field. Air-coupled piezoelectric transducers offer the strengths of both of these technologies and the weaknesses of neither, but are notoriously difficult to calibrate for use in nonlinear measurements. This work proposes a hybrid modeling and experimental approach to air-coupled transducer calibration and the use of this calibration in a model-based optimization to determine the absolute \u03b2 parameter of the material under investigation. This approach is applied to aluminum and fused silica, which are both well-documented materials and provide a strong reference for comparison of experimental and modeling results.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-06-24", "authors": ["DavidTorello", "NicholasSelby", "Jin-YeonKim", "JianminQu", "Laurence JJacobs"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.06.001"}
{"title": "First Demonstration of a Scintillating Xenon Bubble Chamber for Detecting Dark Matter and Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering.", "abstract": "A 30-g xenon bubble chamber, operated at Northwestern University in June and November 2016, has for the first time observed simultaneous bubble nucleation and scintillation by nuclear recoils in a superheated liquid. This chamber is instrumented with a CCD camera for near-IR bubble imaging, a solar-blind photomultiplier tube to detect 175-nm xenon scintillation light, and a piezoelectric acoustic transducer to detect the ultrasonic emission from a growing bubble. The time of nucleation determined from the acoustic signal is used to correlate specific scintillation pulses with bubble-nucleating events. We report on data from this chamber for thermodynamic \"Seitz\" thresholds from 4.2 to 15.0\u00a0keV. The observed single- and multiple-bubble rates when exposed to a ^{252}Cf neutron source indicate that, for an 8.3-keV thermodynamic threshold, the minimum nuclear recoil energy required to nucleate a bubble is 19\u00b16\u2009\u2009keV (1\u03c3 uncertainty). This is consistent with the observed scintillation spectrum for bubble-nucleating events. We see no evidence for bubble nucleation by gamma rays at any of the thresholds studied, setting a 90%\u00a0C.L. upper limit of 6.3\u00d710^{-7} bubbles per gamma interaction at a 4.2-keV thermodynamic threshold. This indicates stronger gamma discrimination than in CF_{3}I bubble chambers, supporting the hypothesis that scintillation production suppresses bubble nucleation by electron recoils, while nuclear recoils nucleate bubbles as usual. These measurements establish the noble-liquid bubble chamber as a promising new technology for the detection of weakly interacting massive particle dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering.", "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2017-06-24", "authors": ["DBaxter", "C JChen", "MCrisler", "TCwiok", "C EDahl", "AGrimsted", "JGupta", "MJin", "RPuig", "DTemples", "JZhang"], "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.231301"}

Piezoelectric PVDF enables generation of electrical charges on its surface upon acoustic stimulation, inducing neuritogenesis of PC12 cells. We demonstrate that the effect of pure piezoelectric stimulation on neurite generation in PC12 cells is comparable to the ones induced by neuronal growth factor (NGF). In inhibitor experiments, our results indicate that dynamic stimulation of PVDF by ultrasonic (US) waves activates calcium channels, thus inducing the generation of neurites via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathway. This mechanism is independent from the well-studied NGF induced mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway.

The irradiation of an ultrasound pulsed wave (amplitude 5 kPa, around 1 MHz) induced weak electrical potentials that were almost 0.1% of that observed with conventional ultrasonic transducers using piezoelectric polymer films.\nThe induced potentials clearly depended on the angle between the direction of the irradiation and the direction of the bone axis and showed a maximum when the angle was 45 degrees. It is known that the ultrasonic wave velocity changes due to the propagation direction and shows anisotropy. The behavior of induced potentials, however, was different from the anisotropy of wave velocities.

We specifically focus on gels that undergo the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction and thus exhibit self-sustained oscillations. In our models, we couple the BZ gel to an overlaying piezoelectric (PZ) cantilever to create a BZ-PZ unit. By connecting the BZ-PZ units by electrical wires, we design networks that autonomously transduce chemical, mechanical, and electrical energy to propagate a signal across the device and achieve synchronization of the oscillating gels in the network. This synchronization allows the device to perform pattern recognition in a self-organized manner, without the need for external electrical power sources. In particular, we imposed a collection of input patterns onto different BZ-PZ networks, where each network encompassed a distinct stored pattern. The network encompassing the stored pattern closest to the input pattern exhibited the fastest convergence time to the stable synchronization behavior, and could be identified as the \"winner\". In this way, the networks of coupled BZ-PZ oscillators achieved pattern recognition. We demonstrated that the convergence time to the stable synchronization provides a robust measure of the degree of match between the input and stored patterns.

The erasing probe is a conically shaped hydrogel (tip size, ca. 500 nm) template-synthesized from track-etched conical glass wafers. The \"nanosponge\" hydrogel probe \"erases\" patterns by hydrating and absorbing molecules into a porous hydrogel matrix via diffusion analogous to a wet sponge. The presence of an interfacial liquid water layer between the hydrogel tip and the substrate during erasing enables frictionless, uninterrupted translation of the eraser on the substrate. The erasing capacity of the hydrogel is extremely high because of the large free volume of the hydrogel matrix. The fast frictionless translocation and interfacial hydration resulted in an extremely high erasing rate (~785 \u03bcm", "journal": "Science advances", "date": "2017-06-21", "authors": ["Pradeep RamiahRajasekaran", "ChuanhongZhou", "MallikaDasari", "Kay-ObbeVoss", "ChristinaTrautmann", "PunitKohli"], "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.1602071"}

For composites, adhesive bonding is usually the preferred choice over the mechanical fastening method, and monitoring for delamination is an essential factor in the field of composite materials. In this study, a non-destructive method known as the electromechanical impedance method is used with an approach of monitoring multiple areas by specifying certain frequency ranges to correspond to a certain test specimen.

Here we propose a scaffold that mimics aspects of cardiac extracellular matrix while preserving the contractility of cardiomyocytes. The scaffold is based on a poly(caprolactone) (PCL) nanofilm with magnetic properties (MNF, standing for magnetic nanofilm) coated with a layer of piezoelectric (PIEZO) microfibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (MNF+PIEZO). The nanofilm creates a flexible support for cell contraction and the aligned PIEZO microfibers deposited on top of the nanofilm creates conditions for cell alignment and electrical stimulation of the seeded cells. Our results indicate that MNF+PIEZO scaffold promotes rat and human cardiac cell attachment and alignment, maintains the ratio of cell populations overtime, promotes cell-cell communication and metabolic maturation, and preserves cardiomyocyte (CM) contractility for at least 12 days.

Photostriction is found to be related to the structural change induced by a screened electric polarization (i.e., a converse piezoelectric effect) in photoexcited electronic states with either p_{x} or p_{y} (in-plane) orbital symmetry that leads to a compression of a_{1} and a comparatively smaller increase of a_{2} for a reduced unit cell area. The structural change documented here is 10 times larger than that observed in BiFeO_{3}, making monochalcogenide monolayers an ultimate platform for this effect.

This study evaluated and compared the marginal seal of class V glass ionomer, composite resin, and amalgam restorations after subjecting them to hand instrumentation and ultrasonic scaling.\nIn this experimental study, 30 sound human first premolars were selected. In each tooth, buccal and lingual cavities (4 mm mesiodistal width, 3 mm occlusogingival height, and 2 mm depth) were made. The teeth were randomly assigned to three groups of 10 teeth: (1) Glass ionomer group, (2) composite group, and (3) amalgam group. Teeth were subjected to thermocycling procedure for 1,000 cycles between 5 and 55\u00b0C water baths and a 1-minute dwell time. Then, each group was randomly subdivided: (1) Margins of 30 restorations were exposed to hand instrumentation procedures by applying 10 working strokes, (2) margins of 30 restorations were exposed to a periodontal tip mounted on a piezoelectric ultrasonic handpiece working at 25 kHz for 10 seconds. The specimens were serially sectioned mesiodistally. Each section was examined under a stereomicroscope. The extent of microleakage was ranked using a 0 to 4 scale at both occlusal and cervical margins of the restorations. Data were analyzed initially using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparisons using the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon test.\nThe type of restorative material had a significant influence on dye penetration, whether in the enamel margin or in the dentinal margin (p < 0.001). The microleakage of glass ionomer group was the highest. No statistical differences were found in dye penetration between scaling groups (hand instrumentation and ultrasonic scaling) (p > 0.05).\nType of restorative material had a significant influence on microleakage.

For quantitative studies of these promoters, the concentration of only a single factor is typically varied to obtain the dose response or transfer function of the promoters with respect to the factor. Such design of experiments has limited our ability to understand quantitative, combinatorial interactions between multiple regulatory factors at promoters. This limitation is primarily due to the intractable number of experimental combinations that arise from multifactorial design of experiments. To overcome this major limitation, we integrate impact printing and cell-free systems to enable multi-dimensional studies of genetic promoters. We first present a gradient printing system which comprises parallel piezoelectric cantilever beams as a scalable actuator array to generate droplets with tunable volumes in the range of 100 pL-10 nL, which facilitates highly accurate direct dilutions in the range of 1-10\u2009000-fold in a 1 \u03bcL drop. Next, we apply this technology to study interactions between three regulatory factors at a synthetic genetic promoter.

{"title": "Structural model of standard ultrasonic transducer array developed for FEM analysis of mechanical crosstalk.", "abstract": "One of the reasons of distortions in ultrasonic imaging are crosstalk effects. They can be divided into groups according to the way of their formation. One of them is constituted by mechanical crosstalk, which is propagated by a construction of a multi-element array of piezoelectric transducers. When an individual transducer is excited, mechanical vibrations are transferred to adjacent construction components, thereby stimulating neighboring transducers to an undesired operation. In order to explore ways of the propagation of such vibrations, the authors developed the FEM model of the array of piezoelectric transducers designed for calculations in COMSOL Multiphysics software. Simulations of activating individual transducers and calculated electrical voltages appearing on transducers unstimulated intentionally, were performed in the time domain in order to assess the propagation velocity of different vibration modes through the construction elements. On this basis, conclusions were drawn in terms of the participation of various construction parts of the array of piezoelectric transducers in the process of creating the mechanical crosstalk. The elaborated FEM model allowed also to examine the ways aimed at reducing the transmission of mechanical crosstalk vibrations through the components of the array. Studies showed that correct cuts in the fasteners and the front layer improve the reduction of the mechanical crosstalk effect. The model can become a helpful tool in the process of design and modifications of manufactured ultrasonic arrays particularly in terms of mechanical crosstalk reduction.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-06-15", "authors": ["MCelmer", "K JOpieli\u0144ski", "MDopiera\u0142a"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.06.006"}

This study introduces the mechanical structure and working principle of a new LWD caliper based on ultrasonic distance measurement (UDM). The detection range is a major performance index of a UDM system. This index is determined by the blind zone length and remote reflecting interface detection capability of the system. To reduce the blind zone length and detect near the reflecting interface, a full bridge acoustic emission technique based on bootstrap gate driver (BGD) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is designed by analyzing the working principle and impedance characteristics of a given piezoelectric transducer. To detect the remote reflecting interface and reduce the dynamic range of the received echo signals, the relationships between the echo amplitude and propagation distance of ultrasonic waves are determined. A signal compensation technique based on time-varying amplification theory, which can automatically change the gain according to the echo arrival time is designed. Lastly, the aforementioned techniques and corresponding circuits are experimentally verified. Results show that the blind zone length in the UDM system of the LWD caliper is significantly reduced and the capability to detect the remote reflecting interface is considerably improved.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-06-13", "authors": ["YongchaoYao", "XiaodongJu", "JunqiangLu", "BaiyongMen"], "doi": "10.3390/s17061351\n10.2118/97224-PA\n10.2118/36545-PA\n10.1109/TCSII.2006.880337\n10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.670-671.1233\n10.1088/1742-2132/6/3/006\n10.1088/1742-2132/11/4/045008\n10.1088/1742-2132/11/4/045006"}

{"title": "A Flexure-Guided Piezo Drill for Penetrating the Zona Pellucida of Mammalian Oocytes.", "abstract": "Mammalian oocytes such as mouse oocytes have a highly elastic outer membrane, zona pellucida (ZP) that cannot be penetrated without significantly deforming the oocyte, even with a sharp micropipette. Piezo drill devices leverage lateral and axial vibration of the micropipette to accomplish ZP penetration with greatly reduced oocyte deformation. However, existing piezo drills all rely on a large lateral micropipette vibration amplitude ( 20 ) and a small axial vibration amplitude (0.1 ). The very large lateral vibration amplitude has been deemed to be necessary for ZP penetration although it also induces larger oocyte deformation and more oocyte damage. This paper reports on a new piezo drill device that uses a flexure guidance mechanism and a systematically designed pulse train with an appropriate base frequency. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that a small lateral vibration amplitude (e.g., 2 ) and an axial vibration amplitude as large as 1.2 were achieved. Besides achieving 100% effectiveness in the penetration of mouse oocytes (n = 45), the new piezo device during ZP penetration induced a small oocyte deformation of 3.4 versus larger than 10 using existing piezo drill devices.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2017-06-11", "authors": ["WesleyJohnson", "ChangshengDai", "JunLiu", "XianWang", "Devin KLuu", "ZhuoranZhang", "ChanghaiRu", "ChaoZhou", "MinTan", "HuayanPu", "ShaorongXie", "YanPeng", "JunLuo", "YuSun"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2017.2713302"}

Although well-developed microfabrication technology has made silicon the prevailing material for MEMS, unique properties of other materials are overlooked in this context. Here we investigate optically induced forces exerted upon a semi-insulating InP waveguide suspended above a highly doped InP:Si substrate, in three different regimes: the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ), with excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and phonons excitation. An order of magnitude amplification of the force is observed when light is coupled to SPPs, and three orders of magnitude amplification is achieved in the phonon excitation regime. In the ENZ regime, the force is found to be repulsive and higher than that in a waveguide suspended above a dielectric substrate. Low losses in InP:Si result in a big propagation length. The induced deflection can be detected by measuring the phase change of the light when passing through the waveguide, which enables all-optical functioning, and paves the way towards integration and miniaturization of micro-cantilevers.

However, since concrete might be susceptible to brittle fracture, it is essential to confirm the strength of concrete at the early-age stage of the curing process to prevent unexpected collapse. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method to estimate the early-age strength of concrete, by integrating an artificial neural network algorithm with a dynamic response measurement of the concrete material. The dynamic response signals of the concrete, including both electromechanical impedances and guided ultrasonic waves, are obtained from an embedded piezoelectric sensor module. The cross-correlation coefficient of the electromechanical impedance signals and the amplitude of the guided ultrasonic wave signals are selected to quantify the variation in dynamic responses according to the strength of the concrete. Furthermore, an artificial neural network algorithm is used to verify a relationship between the variation in dynamic response signals and concrete strength. The results of an experimental study confirm that the proposed approach can be effectively applied to estimate the strength of concrete material from the early-age stage of the curing process.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-06-08", "authors": ["JunkyeongKim", "ChaggilLee", "SeungheePark"], "doi": "10.3390/s17061319\n10.1520/CCA11911\n10.15554/pcij.03012003.72.79\n10.1617/14267\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/038\n10.1784/insi.2016.58.11.609\n10.1080/15732479.2014.920397\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.02.017\n10.1007/s12205-013-0390-1\n10.1155/2013/932568\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/5/055005\n10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(1995)9:4(279)\n10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00165-3\n10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2008)14:1(80)\n10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2004)17:4(154)\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/3/033001\n10.1088/0964-1726/5/2/006\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/6/028\n10.1007/s10921-010-0067-3\n10.1016/S0008-8846(03)00006-1\n10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2005)17:3(353)\n10.1109/MASSP.1987.1165576"}

This paper describes a metal-shielded piezoelectric sensor designed to work in the range of frequencies between 1 and 2 kHz and in these environmental conditions.

{"title": "LEM Characterization of Synthetic Jet Actuators Driven by Piezoelectric Element: A Review.", "abstract": "In the last decades, Synthetic jet actuators have gained much interest among the flow control techniques due to their short response time, high jet velocity and absence of traditional piping, which matches the requirements of reduced size and low weight. A synthetic jet is generated by the diaphragm oscillation (generally driven by a piezoelectric element) in a relatively small cavity, producing periodic cavity pressure variations associated with cavity volume changes. The pressured air exhausts through an orifice, converting diaphragm electrodynamic energy into jet kinetic energy. This review paper considers the development of various Lumped-Element Models (LEMs) as practical tools to design and manufacture the actuators. LEMs can quickly predict device performances such as the frequency response in terms of diaphragm displacement, cavity pressure and jet velocity, as well as the efficiency of energy conversion of input Joule power into useful kinetic power of air jet. The actuator performance is also analyzed by varying typical geometric parameters such as cavity height and orifice diameter and length, through a suited dimensionless form of the governing equations. A comprehensive and detailed physical modeling aimed to evaluate the device efficiency is introduced, shedding light on the different stages involved in the process. Overall, the influence of the coupling degree of the two oscillators, the diaphragm and the Helmholtz frequency, on the device performance is discussed throughout the paper.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-06-08", "authors": ["MatteoChiatto", "FrancescoCapuano", "GennaroCoppola", "Luigide Luca"], "doi": "10.3390/s17061216\n10.1146/annurev.fluid.34.090501.094913\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-122109-160634\n10.1017/S0022112001007406\n10.1098/rsta.2010.0374\n10.1063/1.4943520\n10.2514/2.1236\n10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2008.02.006\n10.1115/1.2241889\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2009.11.005\n10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2007.06.004\n10.1088/1742-6596/778/1/012005\n10.1007/s00542-005-0599-0\n10.1260/1756-8250.1.1.29\n10.1063/1.869828\n10.1017/S0022112002002264\n10.2514/1.12957\n10.1017/S0022112006003995\n10.1017/jfm.2011.258\n10.2514/2.1936\n10.2514/1.19855\n10.2514/1.J051381\n10.1016/j.ast.2009.06.004\n10.2514/1.J051459\n10.2514/1.20747\n10.2514/1.25427\n10.2514/1.J052674\n10.1016/j.sna.2016.06.016\n10.2514/2.7454\n10.2514/1.42967\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.07.030\n10.1016/0894-1777(88)90043-X\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2016.03.020\n10.1121/1.3081514\n10.1243/09596518JSCE519\n10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2017.03.010\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-010816-060042"}

Lamb waves were generated by an Nd:YAG pulse laser system, while a galvanometer-based laser scanner was used to scan the preliminarily designated area. The signals of the structural responses were measured using a piezoelectric sensor attached on the front or back side of the plates. The obtained responses were analyzed by calculating the root mean square (RMS) values to achieve the visualization of structural defects such as crack, corrosion, and so on. If the propagating waves encounter the damage, the waves are scattered at the damage and the energy of the scattered waves can be expressed by the RMS values. In this study, notch and corrosion were artificially formed on aluminum plates and were considered as structural defects. The notches were created with different depths and angles on the aluminum plates, and the corrosion damage was formed with different depths and areas. To visualize the damage more clearly, edge detection methodologies were applied to the RMS images and the feasibility of the methods was investigated.

The absorption of near-infrared wavelength light is significantly enhanced due to the nanostructured/textured top surface. The general performance of the broadband photodiodes can be further improved by the piezo-phototronic effect. The enhancement of responsivity can reach a maximum of 78% to 442 nm illumination, the linearity and saturation limit to 1060 nm light are also significantly increased by applying external strains.

We demonstrate acousto-optic modulation, resonant in both the optical and mechanical domains, in which waveforms encoded on the RF carrier are mapped to the optical field.

{"title": "Enhanced pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties of PZT with aligned porosity for energy harvesting applications.", "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the significant benefits of exploiting highly aligned porosity in piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials for improved energy harvesting performance. Porous lead zirconate (PZT) ceramics with aligned pore channels and varying fractions of porosity were manufactured in a water-based suspension using freeze-casting. The aligned porous PZT ceramics were characterized in detail for both piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties and their energy harvesting performance figures of merit were assessed parallel and perpendicular to the freezing direction. As a result of the introduction of porosity into the ceramic microstructure, high piezoelectric and pyroelectric harvesting figures of merits were achieved for porous freeze-cast PZT compared to dense PZT due to the reduced permittivity and volume specific heat capacity. Experimental results were compared to parallel and series analytical models with good agreement and the PZT with porosity aligned parallel to the freezing direction exhibited the highest piezoelectric and pyroelectric harvesting response; this was a result of the enhanced interconnectivity of the ferroelectric material along the poling direction and reduced fraction of unpoled material that leads to a higher polarization. A complete thermal energy harvesting system, composed of a parallel-aligned PZT harvester element and an AC/DC converter, was successfully demonstrated by charging a storage capacitor. The maximum energy density generated by the 60 vol% porous parallel-connected PZT when subjected to thermal oscillations was 1653 \u03bcJ cm", "journal": "Journal of materials chemistry.

This grafted membrane showed an enhanced hydrophilicity (10\u00b0 decrease of water contact angle), water content ratio, settling ability and wettability compared to the control membrane. Interestingly, filtration tests showed an improved dependence of water flux of the grafted membrane on the solution pH in the acidic stage. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis provided in-situ evidence that the reduced surface pore size of the grafted membrane with the solution pH governed such a dependence. It was proposed that, the reduced surface pore size was caused by the swelling of the grafted chain matrix, with the pH increase due to the\u00a0chemical potential change. It was found that the grafted membrane showed a lower relative flux decreasing rate than the control membrane. Moreover, flux of the bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution was noticeably larger than that of pure water for the grafted membrane. Higher BSA flux than water flux can be explained by the effects of electric double layer compression on the polymeric swelling.

The disposable hydrophones are intended for onetime use in such damaging environments as chemically contaminating fluids and high-amplitude (peak amplitude \u223c100MPa) shock wave fields, where the use of commercial membrane hydrophones is not recommended. Fabrication of a hydrophone is done using only off-the-shelf components and hand tools, which translates into ease of fabrication and orders-of-magnitude reduction in unit cost. In particular, poling and sputtering, the two processes that are chiefly responsible for the cost and difficulty associated with the conventional fabrication method, are replaced with the use of pre-poled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-coated aluminum foils, respectively. Despite the seemingly crude construction, these disposable hydrophones can exhibit voltage sensitivity response that compares favorably with that of commercial hydrophones.

{"title": "Analysis and Validation of Contactless Time-Gated Interrogation Technique for Quartz Resonator Sensors.", "abstract": "A technique for contactless electromagnetic interrogation of AT-cut quartz piezoelectric resonator sensors is proposed based on a primary coil electromagnetically air-coupled to a secondary coil connected to the electrodes of the resonator. The interrogation technique periodically switches between interleaved excitation and detection phases. During the excitation phase, the resonator is set into vibration by a driving voltage applied to the primary coil, whereas in the detection phase, the excitation signal is turned off and the transient decaying response of the resonator is sensed without contact by measuring the voltage induced back across the primary coil. This approach ensures that the readout frequency of the sensor signal is to a first order approximation independent of the interrogation distance between the primary and secondary coils. A detailed theoretical analysis of the interrogation principle based on a lumped-element equivalent circuit is presented. The analysis has been experimentally validated on a 4.432 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal resonator, demonstrating the accurate readout of the series resonant frequency and quality factor over an interrogation distance of up to 2 cm. As an application, the technique has been applied to the measurement of liquid microdroplets deposited on a 4.8 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal.

First, electrical impedance measurements on several elements in air and liquid have been conducted in order to support material parameter identification using the Krimholtz-Leedom-Matthaei model.

This technique is able to directly measure the displacement gradient distribution on the object surface. Shearography visualizes the internal structural damages as the anomalous pattern in the shearograpic fringe pattern. A piezoelectric (PZT) excitation system is able to generate loadings in the vibrational, acoustic, and ultrasonic regimes. In this paper, we propose a PZT-excited stroboscopic shearography. The PZT excitation could generate vibrational loading, a stationary wavefield, and a nonstationary propagation wave to fulfill the external loading requirement of shearography. The sweeping of the PZT excitation frequency, the formation of a standing wave, and a small shearing to suppress the incident wave were powerful controllable tools to detect the defects. The sweeping of the PZT excitation frequency enabled us to determine one of the defect-sensitive frequencies almost in real time. In addition, because the defect sensitive frequencies always existed in wide and plural ranges, the risk of the defect being overlooked by the inspector could be alleviated. The results of evaluation using stroboscopic shearography showed that an artificial 20 mm-diameter defect could be visualized at the excitation frequencies of 5-8 kHz range and 12.5-15.5 kHz range. This technique provided full field reliable and repeatable inspection results.

{"title": "Distributed Piezoelectric Sensor System for Damage Identification in Structures Subjected to Temperature Changes.", "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a very important area in a wide spectrum of fields and engineering applications. With an SHM system, it is possible to reduce the number of non-necessary inspection tasks, the associated risk and the maintenance cost in a wide range of structures during their lifetime. One of the problems in the detection and classification of damage are the constant changes in the operational and environmental conditions. Small changes of these conditions can be considered by the SHM system as damage even though the structure is healthy. Several applications for monitoring of structures have been developed and reported in the literature, and some of them include temperature compensation techniques. In real applications, however, digital processing technologies have proven their value by: (i) offering a very interesting way to acquire information from the structures under test; (ii) applying methodologies to provide a robust analysis; and (iii) performing a damage identification with a practical useful accuracy. This work shows the implementation of an SHM system based on the use of piezoelectric (PZT) sensors for inspecting a structure subjected to temperature changes. The methodology includes the use of multivariate analysis, sensor data fusion and machine learning approaches. The methodology is tested and evaluated with aluminum and composite structures that are subjected to temperature variations.

In cardiac microenvironments, electric pulse and cyclic mechanical strain are sequentially produced. However, no study has applied the pulsatile mechanoelectric cues (PMEC) to stimulate cardiomyogenic differentiation of MSCs ex vivo. In this study, we developed a stretchable piezoelectric substrate (SPS) that can provide PMEC to human MSCs (hMSCs) for cardiomyogenic differentiation ex vivo. Our data showed that hMSCs subjected to PMEC by SPS underwent promoted cardiac phenotype development: cell alignment and the expression of cardiac markers (i.e., cardiac transcription factors, structural proteins, ion channel proteins, and gap junction proteins). The enhanced cardiac phenotype development was mediated by the upregulation of cardiomyogenic differentiation-related autocrine factor expression, focal adhesion kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases signaling pathways. Thus, SPS providing electrical and mechanical regulation of stem cells may be utilized to potentiate hMSC therapies for myocardial infarction and provide a tool for the study of stem cell biology.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2017-06-01", "authors": ["Jeong-KeeYoon", "Tae IlLee", "Suk HoBhang", "Jung-YounShin", "Jae-MinMyoung", "Byung-SooKim"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.7b03050"}

The membrane morphology was observed under a field emission scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that the PVDF hybrid membranes had an asymmetrical structure, and their hydraulic permeability was evidently enhanced with the addition of modified MWNTs. When compared with the primitive PVDF membrane, the hybrid membranes presented improved surface hydrophilicity. After three ultrafiltration-regeneration cycles with bovine serum albumin as model biofoulant and pure water as detergent, the PVDF hybrid membranes exhibited a high flux recovery ratio (FRR). Furthermore, when compared with other membranes, the membrane containing N-Si-MWNTs displayed the highest FRR value of above 96.5% after the entire fouling and cleaning experiment. The fabricated PVDF/N-Si-MWNTs hybrid membranes had excellent antibacterial efficacy, presenting maximum antibacterial efficacy of 98.0% and 95.6% against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively.

Two zygomatic oncology implants (unthreaded coronal portion) were placed in each hemi-maxilla. Implants that achieved an insertion torque superior to 40\u2005Ncm were immediately loaded with screw-retained metal reinforced acrylic provisional prostheses. Outcome measures were: prosthesis and implant failures, any complications, time to place the implants, presence of post-operative haematoma, and patient's preference by independent assessors. All patients were followed up to 1 year after loading.\nIn two patients drills had also to be used at the piezoelectric surgery side to enable implant sites to be prepared. One implant for the conventional drill group did not achieve an insertion torque superior to 40\u2005Ncm since it fractured the zygoma. No patients dropped out and two distal oncology implants failed in the same patient (one per group), who was not prosthetically rehabilitated. Six complications occurred at drilled sites and three at piezoelectric surgery sites (two patients had bilateral complications), the difference being not statistically significant (P (McNemar's test)\u2005=\u20050.375; odds ratio\u2005=\u20054.00; 95% CI of odds ratio: 0.45 to 35.79).

Normally, stress/strain can rotate the magnetization of a shape anisotropic elliptical nanomagnet by only up to 90\u00b0, resulting in incomplete magnetization reversal. Recently, we predicted that applying uniaxial stress sequentially along two different axes that are not collinear with the major or minor axis of the elliptical nanomagnet will rotate the magnetization by full 180\u00b0. Here, we demonstrate this complete 180\u00b0 rotation in elliptical Co nanomagnets (fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate) at room temperature. The two stresses are generated by sequentially applying voltages to two pairs of shorted electrodes placed on the substrate such that the line joining the centers of the electrodes in one pair intersects the major axis of a nanomagnet at \u223c +30\u00b0 and the line joining the centers of the electrodes in the other pair intersects at \u223c -30\u00b0. A finite element analysis has been performed to determine the stress distribution underneath the nanomagnets when one or both pairs of electrodes are activated, and this has been approximately incorporated into a micromagnetic simulation of magnetization dynamics to confirm that the generated stress can produce the observed magnetization rotations.

Twenty-five patients with severe posterior maxillary atrophy were treated with bilateral sinus floor elevation with lateral approach. Antrostomies were randomly performed by eroding the cortical wall with a manual bone scraper (test site) or with an ultrasonic insert (control site) until the membrane was visible under a thin layer of bone, before outlining the window with a piezoelectric device. Occurrence of membrane perforation, laceration of vascular branches, and surgical time were recorded. Mean surgical time of the antrostomy in the test sites was 9'18\", while in the control sites was 9'47\".

{"title": "Role of Piezo Channels in Ultrasound-stimulated Dental Stem Cells.", "abstract": "Piezo1 and Piezo2 are mechanosensitive membrane ion channels. We hypothesized that Piezo proteins may play a role in transducing ultrasound-associated mechanical signals and activate downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling processes in dental cells. In this study, the expression and role of Piezo channels were investigated in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) after treatment with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS).\nCell proliferation was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Western blots were used to analyze the proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as the transcription factors c-fos and c-jun. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were used to determine the activation of MAPK after LIPUS treatment. Ruthenium red (RR), a Piezo ion channel blocker, was applied to determine the functional role of Piezo proteins in LIPUS-stimulated cell proliferation and MAPK signaling.\nWestern blotting showed the presence of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in both dental cell types. LIPUS treatment significantly increased the level of the Piezo proteins in DPSCs after 24 hours; however, no significant effects were observed in PDLSCs. Treatment with RR significantly inhibited LIPUS-stimulated DPSC proliferation but not PDLSC proliferation. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 MAPK was consistently activated in DPSCs over a 24-hour time period after LIPUS exposure, whereas phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK were mainly increased in PDLSCs. RR affected MAPK signaling in both dental cell types with its most prominent effects on ERK1/2/MAPK phosphorylation levels; the significant inhibition of LIPUS-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 activation in DPSCs by RR suggests that stimulation of DPSC proliferation by LIPUS involves Piezo-mediated regulation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling.\nThis study for the first time supports the role of Piezo ion channels in transducing the LIPUS response in dental stem cells.", "journal": "Journal of endodontics", "date": "2017-05-22", "authors": ["QianhuaGao", "Paul RCooper", "A DamienWalmsley", "Ben AScheven"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joen.2017.02.022"}

Nine subjects (5 male, 4 female) walked on a force-instrumented treadmill at 1.34\u00a0m/s for 120\u00a0s each while wearing a shoe that was instrumented with four NCPF sensors. GRF data, measured via the treadmill, and sensor data, measured via the NCPF inserts, were used in a tenfold cross validation process to calibrate a separate model for each individual. The calibration model estimated average anterior-posterior, mediolateral and vertical GRF with mean average errors (MAE) of 6.52\u00a0N (2.14%), 4.79\u00a0N (6.34%), and 15.4\u00a0N (2.15%), respectively. Two additional models were created using the sensor data from all subjects and subject demographics.

Two vibration modes with a phase shift of \u03c0/2 in both space and time domains are exited simultaneously in the elliptical motion of points on the structural surface. By means of adjusting driving signal parameters, such as frequency, voltage amplitude and phase shift, different machining performances could be achieved. The configuration and working vibration modes of the proposed machining tool were firstly calculated by the finite element method, and then the optimal working frequency of the machining tool prototype was determined by vibration characteristic experiments. At last, machining characteristic experiments were conducted to validate the proposed machining method. Experimental results showed that the minimum working contact force between the machining tool and workpiece was 1N, and the chipped depth of 1.93\u03bcm was achieved at the same contact force after machining for 5min. And at the conditions of the contact force of 6N, two driving voltages of 400V", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-05-17", "authors": ["RuinanJi", "JiameiJin", "LiangWang", "JianhuiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.05.001"}
{"title": "Sound Power Estimation for Beam and Plate Structures Using Polyvinylidene Fluoride Films as Sensors.", "abstract": "The theory for calculation and/or measurement of sound power based on the classical velocity-based radiation mode (V-mode) approach is well established for planar structures. However, the current V-mode theory is limited in scope in that it can only be applied to conventional motion sensors (i.e., accelerometers). In this study, in order to estimate the sound power of vibrating beam and plate structure by using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as sensors, a PVDF-based radiation mode (C-mode) approach concept is introduced to determine the sound power radiation from the output signals of PVDF films of the vibrating structure. The proposed method is a hybrid of vibration measurement and numerical calculation of C-modes. The proposed C-mode approach has the following advantages: (1) compared to conventional motion sensors, the PVDF films are lightweight, flexible, and low-cost; (2) there is no need for special measuring environments, since the proposed method does not require the measurement of sound fields; (3) In low frequency range (typically with dimensionless frequency ", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-05-17", "authors": ["QiboMao", "HaibingZhong"], "doi": "10.3390/s17051111\n10.1121/1.400211\n10.1121/1.407490\n10.1121/1.410102\n10.3813/AAA.918253\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2003.08.002\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2008.07.003\n10.1121/1.1499133\n10.1016/j.jsv.2014.09.014\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2015.06.013\n10.1016/j.apacoust.2011.01.006\n10.1121/1.4861242\n10.1088/0964-1726/13/4/017\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.02.046\n10.3390/s121216641\n10.3390/s16091470\n10.1115/1.2892008\n10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.09.001\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.04.005\n10.1115/1.2894001\n10.1088/0964-1726/16/1/004\n10.1016/j.jsv.2015.04.034"}

The use of antibiofouling membranes is an emerging method to tackle this issue. In this study, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was modified using a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) to create an antibiofouling membrane. The membrane was used in an MBR and the performance, mechanisms, and effects on microbial communities of this membrane were compared to a control operated in parallel. Results showed that the membrane exhibited a significantly reduced transmembrane pressure increase rate of 0.29\u00a0kPa/d compared with 0.91\u00a0kPa/d of the control. Analysis using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) revealed almost complete lack of living microbes on the antibiofouling membrane in contrast to the control. However, specific oxygen uptake rate and dehydrogenase activity analyses demonstrated no adverse impacts on microbial viability of the bulk activated sludge. Bacterial population analysis using the Illumina Miseq platform added further evidence that the use of antibiofouling membrane did not exert negative influences on richness, diversity and structure of the bacterial community. Effluent quality of the test MBR also exhibited minimal difference from that of the control reactor. The amount of polysaccharides and proteins in the biofouling layer was also significantly reduced.

In order to improve reproducibility, this study addresses (1) how solution processing steps (oxidation, sonication) affect CNT properties, and (2) how CNT chemistry, morphology, and dispersion influence alignment. Aligned CNT were deposited onto PVDF membranes using a combination of electric-field alignment and vacuum-filtration. At each step in solution processing, the CNT chemistry (oxygen content) and morphology (length/diameter) were characterized and compared to the final aligned morphology.

PIM membrane exhibited a hydrophobic (\u223c100\u00b0) and thermally stable up to \u223c200\u00b0C porous homogenous structure. The transport of Ni(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solutions was studied by competitive transport across polymer inclusion membranes (PIM). Competitive transport of ions in solution across PIM provide the selectivity order: Ni", "journal": "Journal of hazardous materials", "date": "2017-05-12", "authors": ["DjamilaZioui", "OmarArous", "NabilMameri", "Hac\u00e8neKerdjoudj", "M SanSebastian", "J LVilas", "JNunes-Pereira", "SenentxuLanceros-M\u00e9ndez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.04.035"}
{"title": "Intraoperative Complications During Sinus Floor Elevation with Lateral Approach: A Systematic Review.", "abstract": "To analyze the occurrence of intraoperative complications during sinus floor elevation with a lateral approach and their correlations with the technique adopted by surgeons.\nElectronic and manual searches resulted in 4,417 records on sinus floor elevation. Twenty-one randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 prospective controlled clinical trials (CCTs) reporting occurrence of intraoperative complications were included. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane tool and a modified Downs and Black quality analysis for RCTs and CCTs, respectively.\nSinus membrane perforation and hemorrhagic events following vascular lesions were the only intraoperative complications reported by the selected studies with overall occurrences of 15.7% and 0.4%, respectively. Three different surgical devices (rotary instruments, piezoelectric osteotomes, and manual bone scrapers) were used to perform the lateral antrostomy. Ultrasonic devices and bone scrapers showed a lower incidence (10.9% and 6.0%, respectively) of membrane perforation compared with that of rotary instruments (20.1%). Among the different ultrasonic procedures, erosion of the lateral antral wall showed the lowest membrane perforations (4.7% incidence). Hemorrhagic complications seemed to be extremely infrequent with any surgical technique.\nSinus membrane perforation was the most frequently described intraoperative complication during sinus floor elevation with a lateral approach. Thinning the lateral wall of the sinus before performing the antrostomy (either with ultrasonic devices or manual bone scrapers) seemed to be an important factor in preventing membrane perforation during sinus surgery. Further high-quality RCTs specifically investigating intraoperative complication occurrence are needed.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2017-05-12", "authors": ["ClaudioStacchi", "FrancescaAndolsek", "FedericoBerton", "GiuseppePerinetti", "Chiara OttaviaNavarra", "RobertoDi Lenarda"], "doi": "10.11607/jomi.4884"}

Surgical viability is typically determined via endoscopic ultrasound imaging. However, many patients who may be eligible for resection are not offered surgery due to diagnostic challenges in determining vascular or lymphatic invasion. In this paper, we describe the development of a dual-frequency piezoelectric transducer for rotational endoscopic imaging designed to transmit at 4 MHz and receive at 20 MHz in order to image microbubble-specific superharmonic signals. Imaging performance is assessed in a tissue-mimicking phantom at depths from 1 cm [contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) = 21.6 dB] to 2.5 cm (CTR = 11.4 dB), in ex vivo porcine vessels, and in vivo in a rodent. The prototyped 1.1-mm aperture transducer demonstrates contrast-specific imaging of microbubbles in a 200- [Formula: see text]-diameter tube through the wall of a 1-cm-diameter porcine artery, suggesting such a device may enable direct visualization of small vessels from within the lumen of larger vessels such as the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2017-05-11", "authors": ["Brooks DLindsey", "JinwookKim", "Paul ADayton", "XiaoningJiang"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2702010"}

{"title": "Trans-oral miniature X-ray radiation delivery system with endoscopic optical feedback.", "abstract": "Surgery, chemo- and/or external radiation therapy are the standard therapy options for the treatment of laryngeal cancer. Trans-oral access for the surgery reduces traumata and hospitalization time. A new trend in treatment is organ-preserving surgery. To avoid regrowth of cancer, this type of surgery can be combined with radiation therapy. Since external radiation includes healthy tissue surrounding the cancerous zone, a local and direct intraoral radiation delivery would be beneficial.\nA general concept for a trans-oral radiation system was designed, based on clinical need identification with a medical user. A miniaturized X-ray tube was used as the radiation source for the intraoperative radiation delivery. To reduce dose distribution on healthy areas, the X-ray source was collimated by a newly designed adjustable shielding system as part of the housing. For direct optical visualization of the radiation zone, a miniature flexible endoscope was integrated into the system. The endoscopic light cone and the field of view were aligned with the zone of the collimated radiation. The intraoperative radiation system was mounted on a semi-automatic medical holder that was combined with a frontal actuator for rotational and translational movement using piezoelectric motors to provide precise placement.\nThe entire technical set-up was tested in a simulated environment. The shielding of the X-ray source was verified by performing conventional detector-based dose measurements. The delivered dose was estimated by an ionization chamber. The adjustment of the radiation zone was performed by a manual controlling mechanism integrated into the hand piece of the device. An endoscopic fibre was also added to offer visualization and illumination of the radiation zone. The combination of the radiation system with the semi-automatic holder and actuator offered precise and stable positioning of the device in range of micrometres and will allow for future combination with a radiation planning system.\nThe presented system was designed for radiation therapy of the oral cavity and the larynx. This first set-up tried to cover all clinical aspects that are necessary for a later use in surgery. The miniaturized X-ray tube offers the size and the power for intraoperative radiation therapy. The adjustable shielding system in combination with the holder and actuator provides a precise placement.

B. anthracis was not recovered from any of 18 replicates generated from high concentrations of vegetative cells (107 to 108 cfu), but a single B. anthracis colony was recovered from one of 18 replicates generated from high concentrations of bacterial spores (108 cfu), using a post-treatment viability culture method of 7 days on L-agar plate only.

However, the present understanding of the mechanical behavior of cement-based piezoelectric smart materials under impact load is still limited. The dynamic characteristics under impact load are of importance, for example, for studying the anti-collision properties of engineering structures and aircraft takeoff-landing safety. Therefore, in this paper, an analytical model was proposed to investigate the dynamic properties of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor under impact load based on the piezoelectric effect. Theoretical solutions are obtained by utilizing the variable separation and Duhamel integral method. To simulate the impact load and verify the theory, three types of loads, including atransient step load, isosceles triangle load and haversine wave load, are considered and the comparisons between the theoretical results, Li's results and numerical results are presented by using the control variate method and good agreement is found.

In this paper, the dynamical model is established to analyze various forms of energy consumption. In addition, a FE COMSOL model is also created to discuss the damping influences of several significant parameters of the adhesive layer and piezoelectric electrodes, respectively, and then explicit influence laws are obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the adhesive layer has some impact on the damping characteristic, but it not significant.

It is found that the optical confinement factor of multi-quantum well (MQW) always increases with increasing indium content of InGaN barrier layer, which results in a decrease of threshold current when indium content of InGaN barrier layer increases from 0 to 5%. However, when a high In content InGaN barrier is used (> 5%), both threshold current and slop efficiency of LDs deteriorate. It may be attributed to the waste of carriers in the potential well at the interface between the last barrier (LB) and the upper waveguide (UWG) layers, which is induced by the piezoelectric polarization effect in high In content InGaN LB layer. Therefore, a new LD structure using a thin thickness of the LB layer to reduce the effect of polarization shows a low threshold current and a high output power even when the In content of barrier layers is as large as 7%.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2017-05-05", "authors": ["JYang", "D GZhao", "D SJiang", "XLi", "FLiang", "PChen", "J JZhu", "Z SLiu", "S TLiu", "L QZhang", "MLi"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.25.009595"}

To avoid this problem, this study proposes a novel method for collecting single cell suspensions from culture chambers for subculture using an ultrasonic pump driven by the squeeze film effect. First, we developed a cell culture device consisting of a cell culture substrate with a piezoelectric ceramic disk glued to the back, so that we can elicit resonance vibration of the substrate. A glass pipe is then placed vertically against the cell culture substrate with a slight gap (corresponding to cell diameter) between the pipe and the substrate. By exciting an out-of-plane resonance vibration of the cell culture substrate, we can collect a cell suspension from the cell culture chamber. Since the gap distance between the glass pipe and the cell culture substrate corresponds to cell diameter, the collected cell suspension only contains single cells. We evaluated the capability of the developed cell suspension pumping system and the proliferation of the collected cells with C2C12 myoblast cells. The ratio of single cells in the cell suspension was improved by up to 9.6% compared with that of suspensions collected by the control method (traditional pipetting). Moreover, after cultivating the collected cells for 72 hr, the cells collected by our method proliferated 13.6% more than those collected by the control method.

Several surgical procedures have been advocated for bone augmentation of the atrophic mandible, and the sandwich osteotomy is one of these techniques. The aim of the present case report was to assess the suitability of segmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy combined with a tunnel technique of soft tissue. Based on our knowledge, nobody described before the sandwich osteotomy with tunnel technique to improve the healing of the wound and meet the dimensional requirements of preimplant bone augmentation in cases of a severely atrophic mandible.\nA 59-year-old woman with a severely atrophied right mandible was treated with the sandwich osteotomy technique filled with autologous bone graft harvested by a cortical bone collector from the ramus. Clinical examination revealed that the mandible was edentulous bilaterally from the first molar to the second molar region. Radiographically, atrophy of the mandibular alveolar ridge in the same teeth site was observed. We began to treat the right side. A horizontal osteotomy of the edentulous mandibular bone was then made with a piezoelectric device after tunnel technique of the soft tissue. The segmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy (SMSO) was finished by two (mesial and distal) slightly divergent vertical osteotomies. The entire bone fragment was displaced cranially, and the desirable position was obtained. The gap was filled completely with autologous bone chips harvested from the mandibular ramus through a cortical bone collector. No barrier membranes were used to protect the grafts. The vertical incisions were closing with interruptive suturing of the flaps with a resorbable material. In this way, the suture will not fall on the osteotomy line of the jaw; the result will be a better predictability of soft and hard tissue healing.\nSegmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy is an easy and safety technique that could be performed in an atrophic posterior mandible.

{"title": "Note: An improved low-frequency correction technique for piezoelectric force sensors in high-speed nanopositioning systems.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric force and position sensors provide high sensitivity but are limited at low frequencies due to their high-pass response which complicates the direct application of integral control. To overcome this issue, an additional sensor or low-frequency correction method is typically employed. However, these approaches introduce an additional first-order response that must be higher than the high-pass response of the piezo and interface electronics. This article describes a simplified method for low-frequency correction that uses the piezoelectric sensor as an electrical component in a filter circuit. The resulting response is first-order, rather than second-order, with a cut-off frequency equal to that of a buffer circuit with the same input resistance. The proposed method is demonstrated to allow simultaneous damping and tracking control of a high-speed vertical nanopositioning stage.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2017-05-01", "authors": ["Yuen KYong", "Andrew JFleming"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4981530"}

In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate if cell source, either from bone marrow or adipose tissue, affects bone repair induced by osteoblastic cells associated with a membrane of poly(vinylidene-trifluoroethylene)/barium titanate (PVDF-TrFE/BT). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were isolated from rat bone marrow and adipose tissue and characterized by detection of several surface markers. Also, both cell populations were cultured under osteogenic conditions and it was observed that MSC from bone marrow were more osteogenic than MSC from adipose tissue. The bone repair was evaluated in rat calvarial defects implanted with PVDF-TrFE/BT membrane and locally injected with (1) osteoblastic cells differentiated from MSC from bone marrow, (2) osteoblastic cells differentiated from MSC from adipose tissue or (3) phosphate-buffered saline. Luciferase-expressing osteoblastic cells derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue were detected in bone defects after cell injection during 25\u00a0days without difference in luciferin signal between cells from both sources. Corroborating the in vitro findings, osteoblastic cells from bone marrow combined with the PVDF-TrFE/BT membrane increased the bone formation, whereas osteoblastic cells from adipose tissue did not enhance the bone repair induced by the membrane itself. Based on these findings, it is possible to conclude that, by combining a membrane with cells in this rat model, cell source matters and that bone marrow could be a more suitable source of cells for therapies to engineer bone.", "journal": "Calcified tissue international", "date": "2017-04-30", "authors": ["Gileade PFreitas", "Helena BLopes", "Adriana L GAlmeida", "Rodrigo P FAbuna", "RossanoGimenes", "Lucas E BSouza", "Dimas TCovas", "Marcio MBeloti", "Adalberto LRosa"], "doi": "10.1007/s00223-017-0282-3"}

We employ density functional theory (DFT) to reveal that the pristine Si(111)-3\u00d73 R30\u00b0 (Si3 hereafter) reconstructed surfaces of thin films with a thickness smaller than eleven bilayers support a sizeable linear ME effect with switchable direction of magnetic moment under external electric field. This is achieved through the interlayer exchange coupling effect in the antiferromagnetic regime, where the spin-up and spin-down magnetized density is located on opposite surfaces of Si3 thin films. The obtained coefficient for the linear ME effect can be four times larger than that of ferromagnetic Fe films, which fail to have the reversal switching capabilities. The larger ME effect originates from the spin-dependent screening of the spin-polarized Dirac fermion.

In this approach, abundantly available environmental motion energy is absorbed by a Low Frequency Resonator (LFR) which transfers it to a high frequency Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester (PVEH) via impact or magnetic coupling. As a result, a decaying alternating output signal is produced, that can later be collected using a battery or be transferred directly to the electric load. The paper reports an impact-coupled frequency up-converting tandem setup with different LFR to PVEH natural frequency ratios and varying contact point location along the length of the harvester. RMS power output of different frequency up-converting tandems with optimal resistive values was found from the transient analysis revealing a strong relation between power output and LFR-PVEH natural frequency ratio as well as impact point location. Simulations revealed that higher power output is obtained from a higher natural frequency ratio between LFR and PVEH, an increase of power output by one order of magnitude for a doubled natural frequency ratio and up to 150% difference in power output from different impact point locations.

Most of the current methods for producing and studying such small cell populations are complex to implement and require skilled personnel limiting their widespread utility in biomedical research labs. We present a simple and rapid method to produce small populations with varying size of epithelial cells (10-50 cells/population) with high-throughput (~ 1 population/second) on flat surfaces via patterning of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and random seeding of cells. We demonstrate that despite inherent limitations of non-contact, drop-on-demand piezoelectric inkjet printing for protein patterning, varying mixtures of ECM proteins can be deposited with high reproducibility and level of control on glass substrates using a set of dynamically adjustable optimized deposition parameters. We demonstrate high consistency for the number of cells per population (~1 cell standard error of mean), the population's size (~0.2 coefficient of variation) and shape, as well as accurate spatial placement of and distance between colonies of a panel of metaplastic and dysplastic esophageal epithelial cells with differing adhesion and motility characteristics. The number of cells per colony, colony size and shape can be varied by dynamically varying the amount of ECM proteins deposited per spatial location and the number of spatial locations on the substrate.

{"title": "Electromechanical Coupling Factor of Breast Tissue as a Biomarker for Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "This research aims to validate a new biomarker of breast cancer by introducing electromechanical coupling factor of breast tissue samples as a possible additional indicator of breast cancer. Since collagen fibril exhibits a structural organization that gives rise to a piezoelectric effect, the difference in collagen density between normal and cancerous tissue can be captured by identifying the corresponding electromechanical coupling factor.\nThe design of a portable diagnostic tool and a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based biochip, which is integrated with a piezoresistive sensing layer for measuring the reaction force as well as a microheater for temperature control, is introduced. To verify that electromechanical coupling factor can be used as a biomarker for breast cancer, the piezoelectric model for breast tissue is described with preliminary experimental results on five sets of normal and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples in the 25-45 temperature range.\nWhile the stiffness of breast tissues can be captured as a representative mechanical signature which allows one to discriminate among tissue types especially in the higher strain region, the electromechanical coupling factor shows more distinct differences between the normal and IDC groups over the entire strain region than the mechanical signature. From the two-sample -test, the electromechanical coupling factor under compression shows statistically significant differences ( 0.0039) between the two groups.\nThe increase in collagen density in breast tissue is an objective and reproducible characteristic of breast cancer. Although characterization of mechanical tissue property has been shown to be useful for differentiating cancerous tissue from normal tissue, using a single parameter may not be sufficient for practical usage due to inherent variation among biological samples. The portable breast cancer diagnostic tool reported in this manuscript shows the feasibility of measuring multiple parameters of breast tissue allowing for practical application.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2017-04-25", "authors": ["KihanPark", "WenjinChen", "Marina AChekmareva", "David JForan", "Jaydev PDesai"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2017.2695103"}

In this process, a functional pattern of nanoparticles is transferred via peeling from a temporary substrate to the final PVDF film. This peeling process takes advantage of the differences in the work of adhesion between the various layers (the PVDF layer, the nanoparticle-pattern layer and the substrate layer) and of the high stresses generated by the differential thermal expansion of the layers. The work of adhesion is mainly guided by the basic physical/chemical properties of these layers and is highly sensitive to variations in temperature and moisture in the environment. The peeling technique is tested on a variety of PVDF-based functional films using gold/palladium nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, and lithium iron phosphate. Several PVDF-based flexible nanodevices are prepared, including a single-sided wireless flexible humidity sensor in which PVDF is used as the substrate and a double-sided flexible capacitor in which PVDF is used as the ferroelectric layer and the carrier layer. Results show that the nanodevices perform with high repeatability and stability.

The results showed that PP membrane was not suitable for the MD operation due to its lower heat resistance. A flux decline of 50% was observed for the PTFE, while PVDF displayed a more severe decrement of 70%. Additionally, the PTFE and PVDF membranes both demonstrated a faster flux decline during the early period, and then a clear decrement of fouling rate was obtained at the later period. To better understand the interactions between LYS and different membranes, the interaction energy between LYS and the reconstructed membrane surface, represented by XDLVO potential, was calculated by surface element integration. The PVDF membrane exhibited higher roughness and lower energy barrier, indicating that rougher membrane was tended to be fouled by LYS.

{"title": "A multiplex culture system for the long-term growth of fission yeast cells.", "abstract": "Maintenance of long-term cultures of yeast cells is central to a broad range of investigations, from metabolic studies to laboratory evolution assays. However, repeated dilutions of batch cultures lead to variations in medium composition, with implications for cell physiology. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, powerful miniaturized chemostat setups, or ministat arrays, have been shown to allow for constant dilution of multiple independent cultures. Here we set out to adapt these arrays for continuous culture of a morphologically and physiologically distinct yeast, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, with the goal of maintaining constant population density over time. First, we demonstrated that the original ministats are incompatible with growing fission yeast for more than a few generations, prompting us to modify different aspects of the system design. Next, we identified critical parameters for sustaining unbiased vegetative growth in these conditions. This requires deletion of the gsf2 flocculin-encoding gene, along with addition of galactose to the medium and lowering of the culture temperature. Importantly, we improved the flexibility of the ministats by developing a piezo-pump module for the independent regulation of the dilution rate of each culture. This made it possible to easily grow strains that have different generation times in the same assay. Our system therefore allows for maintaining multiple fission yeast cultures in exponential growth, adapting the dilution of each culture over time to keep constant population density for hundreds of generations. These multiplex culture systems open the door to a new range of long-term experiments using this model organism. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

The thickness of the oil film is, however, very small and conventional vibration sensors are too cumbersome to use in this confined space. This paper solves this problem by using a piezoelectric polymer film made from Polyvinylidine Fluoride (PVDF). These films are very thin (50 m) and flexible and easy to install in awkward spaces such as the inside of a thrust bearing.

The effect of copolymer blend ratios and TFE/VP ratios on membrane properties were evaluated, and the stability of P(TFE-VP) in PVDF membrane was studied. The membrane morphology was controlled by adjusting polymer concentration in dope solution, such that all membranes have similar pore size and density, as well as pure water permeability. In evaluating the effect of TFE/VP ratios, the content of VP in dope solutions was also adjusted to allow a fair comparison. We found that for P(TFE-VP) with a higher VP content, adsorption of BSA on polymer film was negligible. Higher blend ratios of this copolymer resulted in higher surface VP content and better hydrophilicity, but antifouling performance ceased to improve when blend ratio was larger than 1:9 (copolymer:PVDF). Meanwhile, a lower VP content in copolymer resulted in inferior hydrophilicity and severe fouling of the blend membranes.

The existing literature regarding its use specifically for otolaryngology, and head and neck surgery was reviewed.\nThe databases Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts were searched. Studies were selected and reviewed based on relevance.\nSixty studies were identified and examined for evidence of benefits and disadvantages of piezoelectric surgery and its application in otolaryngology. The technique was compared with traditional surgical methods, in terms of intra-operative bleeding, histology, learning curve, operative time and post-operative pain.\nPiezoelectric technology has been successfully employed, particularly in otology and skull base surgery, where its specific advantages versus traditional drills include a lack of 'blunting' and tissue selectivity. Technical advantages include ease of use, a short learning curve and improved visibility. Its higher cost warrants consideration given that clinically significant improvements in operative time and morbidity have not yet been proven.

{"title": "Design optimization of embedded ultrasonic transducers for concrete structures assessment.", "abstract": "In the last decades, the field of structural health monitoring and damage detection has been intensively explored. Active vibration techniques allow to excite structures at high frequency vibrations which are sensitive to small damage. Piezoelectric PZT transducers are perfect candidates for such testing due to their small size, low cost and large bandwidth. Current ultrasonic systems are based on external piezoelectric transducers which need to be placed on two faces of the concrete specimen. The limited accessibility of in-service structures makes such an arrangement often impractical. An alternative is to embed permanently low-cost transducers inside the structure. Such types of transducers have been applied successfully for the in-situ estimation of the P-wave velocity in fresh concrete, and for crack monitoring. Up to now, the design of such transducers was essentially based on trial and error, or in a few cases, on the limitation of the acoustic impedance mismatch between the PZT and concrete. In the present study, we explore the working principles of embedded piezoelectric transducers which are found to be significantly different from external transducers. One of the major challenges concerning embedded transducers is to produce very low cost transducers. We show that a practical way to achieve this imperative is to consider the radial mode of actuation of bulk PZT elements. This is done by developing a simple finite element model of a piezoelectric transducer embedded in an infinite medium. The model is coupled with a multi-objective genetic algorithm which is used to design specific ultrasonic embedded transducers both for hard and fresh concrete monitoring. The results show the efficiency of the approach and a few designs are proposed which are optimal for hard concrete, fresh concrete, or both, in a given frequency band of interest.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-04-17", "authors": ["C\u00e9dricDumoulin", "ArnaudDeraemaeker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.04.002"}

Though electromagnetic realizations of gyrators have been well studied, devices based on other forms of interaction are relatively unexplored. Here we demonstrate a device in which signal is transmitted via magneto-elastic coupling, can function as a gyrator. The device is built on a piezoelectric substrate: one port of this device has interdigital transducers (IDTs) and the other port has a periodic array of nickel/gold lines. When the magnetizations of Ni lines are excited into precession by magnetic field generated by passing oscillating current through the gold lines, they emit phonons in the form of surface acoustic waves (SAW) due to the magneto-elastic coupling between Ni and substrate. The emitted SAW can be detected at the other end by the IDTs. Conversely, when SAW is incident on Ni lines from IDTs, the magnetization undergoes precession and can be inductively detected by Au lines. The broken time reversal symmetry of the system due to the presence of ferromagnet gives rise to the non-reciprocal transmission between the two ports.

{"title": "Inkjet printing technology for increasing the I/O density of 3D TSV interposers.", "abstract": "Interposers with through-silicon vias (TSVs) play a key role in the three-dimensional integration and packaging of integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems. In the current practice of fabricating interposers, solder balls are placed next to the vias; however, this approach requires a large foot print for the input/output (I/O) connections. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the possibility of placing the solder balls directly on top of the vias, thereby enabling a smaller pitch between the solder balls and an increased density of the I/O connections. To reach this goal, inkjet printing (that is, piezo and super inkjet) was used to successfully fill and planarize hollow metal TSVs with a dielectric polymer. The under bump metallization (UBM) pads were also successfully printed with inkjet technology on top of the polymer-filled vias, using either Ag or Au inks. The reliability of the TSV interposers was investigated by a temperature cycling stress test (-40\u2009\u00b0C to +125\u2009\u00b0C). The stress test showed no impact on DC resistance of the TSVs; however, shrinkage and delamination of the polymer was observed, along with some micro-cracks in the UBM pads.

This observation comes from a new modification to a conventional piezoelectric pressure catheter, used to independently separate and quantify total tissue pressure, solid stress (SS), and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) within the same tumor location, thereby clarifying the relationship between these parameters.

{"title": "Porosity and tissue integration of elastic mesh implants evaluated in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "In vivo, a loss of mesh porosity triggers scar tissue formation and restricts functionality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the properties and configuration changes as mesh deformation and mesh shrinkage of a soft mesh implant compared with a conventional stiff mesh implant in vitro and in a porcine model.\nTensile tests and digital image correlation were used to determine the textile porosity for both mesh types in vitro. A group of three pigs each were treated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visible conventional stiff polyvinylidene fluoride meshes (PVDF) or with soft thermoplastic polyurethane meshes (TPU) (FEG Textiltechnik mbH, Aachen, Germany), respectively. MRI was performed with a pneumoperitoneum at a pressure of 0 and 15 mmHg, which resulted in bulging of the abdomen. The mesh-induced signal voids were semiautomatically segmented and the mesh areas were determined. With the deformations assessed in both mesh types at both pressure conditions, the porosity change of the meshes after 8 weeks of ingrowth was calculated as an indicator of preserved elastic properties. The explanted specimens were examined histologically for the maturity of the scar (collagen I/III ratio).\nIn TPU, the in vitro porosity increased constantly, in PVDF, a loss of porosity was observed under mild stresses. In vivo, the mean mesh areas of TPU were 206.8 cm\nThe elastic properties of TPU mesh implants result in improved tissue integration compared to conventional PVDF meshes, and they adapt more efficiently to the abdominal wall. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Computer vision distortion correction of scanning probe microscopy images.", "abstract": "Since its inception, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has established itself as the tool of choice for probing surfaces and functionalities at the nanoscale. Although recent developments in the instrumentation have greatly improved the metrological aspects of SPM, it is still plagued by the drifts and nonlinearities of the piezoelectric actuators underlying the precise nanoscale motion. In this work, we present an innovative computer-vision-based distortion correction algorithm for offline processing of functional SPM measurements, allowing two images to be directly overlaid with minimal error - thus correlating position with time evolution and local functionality. To demonstrate its versatility, the algorithm is applied to two very different systems.

{"title": "Surface Acoustic Waves to Drive Plant Transpiration.", "abstract": "Emerging fields of research in electronic plants (e-plants) and agro-nanotechnology seek to create more advanced control of plants and their products. Electronic/nanotechnology plant systems strive to seamlessly monitor, harvest, or deliver chemical signals to sense or regulate plant physiology in a controlled manner. Since the plant vascular system (xylem/phloem) is the primary pathway used to transport water, nutrients, and chemical signals-as well as the primary vehicle for current e-plant and phtyo-nanotechnology work-we seek to directly control fluid transport in plants using external energy. Surface acoustic waves generated from piezoelectric substrates were directly coupled into rose leaves, thereby causing water to rapidly evaporate in a highly localized manner only at the site in contact with the actuator. From fluorescent imaging, we find that the technique reliably delivers up to 6x more water/solute to the site actuated by acoustic energy as compared to normal plant transpiration rates and 2x more than heat-assisted evaporation. The technique of increasing natural plant transpiration through acoustic energy could be used to deliver biomolecules, agrochemicals, or future electronic materials at high spatiotemporal resolution to targeted areas in the plant; providing better interaction with plant physiology or to realize more sophisticated cyborg systems.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-04-01", "authors": ["Eliot FGomez", "MagnusBerggren", "Daniel TSimon"], "doi": "10.1038/srep45864\n10.1126/sciadv.1501136\n10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.04.012\n10.1016/j.tplants.2016.04.005\n10.1038/nmat3890\n10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141418\n10.1039/c4lc00182f\n10.1039/C5LC00265F\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.005\n10.1039/B915833B\n10.1039/B915522H\n10.1021/ac200380q\n10.1039/C4LC00495G\n10.1016/j.postharvbio.2011.12.020\n10.1039/C5RA25890A\n10.1039/C2LC40085E\n10.1021/ac00086a003\n10.1039/C2LC21065G\n10.1007/s00436-008-0975-7\n10.1021/acsnano.5b04378\n10.1038/nnano.2007.108\n10.1093/jxb/err111\n10.1039/B910595F\n10.1039/C6LC00590J"}
{"title": "Comparative study of shear wave-based elastography techniques in optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "We compare five optical coherence elastography techniques able to estimate the shear speed of waves generated by one and two sources of excitation. The first two techniques make use of one piezoelectric actuator in order to produce a continuous shear wave propagation or a tone-burst propagation (TBP) of 400 Hz over a gelatin tissue-mimicking phantom. The remaining techniques utilize a second actuator located on the opposite side of the region of interest in order to create three types of interference patterns: crawling waves, swept crawling waves, and standing waves, depending on the selection of the frequency difference between the two actuators. We evaluated accuracy, contrast to noise ratio, resolution, and acquisition time for each technique during experiments. Numerical simulations were also performed in order to support the experimental findings. Results suggest that in the presence of strong internal reflections, single source methods are more accurate and less variable when compared to the two-actuator methods. In particular, TBP reports the best performance with an accuracy error < 4.1 % . Finally, the TBP was tested in a fresh chicken tibialis anterior muscle with a localized thermally ablated lesion in order to evaluate its performance in biological tissue.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2017-03-31", "authors": ["FernandoZvietcovich", "Jannick PRolland", "JianingYao", "PanomsakMeemon", "Kevin JParker"], "doi": "10.1117/1.JBO.22.3.035010"}

The M149 antibody was hybridized to nano-vesicles consisting of pentacosa-10,12-diynoic acid (PCDA) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC). After photo-polymerization at 254 nm, the effects on the PDA by antigenic injection were investigated with UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Because PDA, an alternating ene-yne molecule, induces a blue-to-red color transition and an interesting fluorescent response by the distortion of its backbone, the biomolecular recognition of an antibody\u207bantigen can be converted into an optical and fluorescent signal. Thus, an influenza antigen was successfully detected with the proposed label-free method.

Here we report an experimental study of the local structure by applying total elastic scattering and Raman scattering analyses to an important non-relaxor ferroelectric solid solution exhibiting the so-called composition-induced morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), where concomitant enhancement of physical properties have been detected. The powerful combination of static and dynamic structural probes enabled us to derive direct correspondence between the atomic-level structural correlations and reported properties. The atomic pair distribution functions obtained from the neutron total scattering experiments were analysed through big-box atom-modelling implementing reverse Monte Carlo method, from which distributions of magnitudes and directions of off-centred cationic displacements were extracted. We found that an enhanced randomness of the displacement-directions for all ferroelectrically active cations combined with a strong dynamical coupling between the A- and B-site cations of the perovskite structure, can explain the abrupt amplification of piezoelectric response of the system near MPB.

{"title": "Frequency tuning allows flow direction control in microfluidic networks with passive features.", "abstract": "Frequency tuning has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional pumping techniques in microfluidics. Oscillating (AC) flow driven through a passive valve can be rectified to create steady (DC) flow, and tuning the excitation frequency to the characteristic (resonance) frequency of the underlying microfluidic network allows control of flow magnitude using simple hardware, such as an on-chip piezo buzzer. In this paper, we report that frequency tuning can also be used to control the direction (forward or backward) of the rectified DC flow in a single device. Initially, we observed that certain devices provided DC flow in the \"forward\" direction expected from previous work with a similar valve geometry, and the maximum DC flow occurred at the same frequency as a prominent peak in the AC flow magnitude, as expected. However, devices of a slightly different geometry provided the DC flow in the opposite direction and at a frequency well below the peak AC flow. Using an equivalent electrical circuit model, we found that the \"forward\" DC flow occurred at the series resonance frequency (with large AC flow peak), while the \"backward\" DC flow occurred at a less obvious parallel resonance (a valley in AC flow magnitude). We also observed that the DC flow occurred only when there was a measurable differential in the AC flow magnitude across the valve, and the DC flow direction was from the channel with large AC flow magnitude to that with small AC flow magnitude. Using these observations and the AC flow predictions from the equivalent circuit model, we designed a device with an AC flowrate frequency profile that was expected to allow the DC flow in opposite directions at two distinct frequencies. The fabricated device showed the expected flow reversal at the expected frequencies. This approach expands the flow control toolkit to include both magnitude and direction control in frequency-tuned microfluidic pumps. The work also raises interesting questions about the origin of flow reversal behavior that may be addressed by the further study of the circuit model behavior or dynamic modeling of the fluid-solid mechanics of the valve under the AC flow.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2017-03-30", "authors": ["RahilJain", "BarryLutz"], "doi": "10.1039/c7lc00058h"}

The mechanisms underlying such vicarious sensory experiences are thought to reflect hyperactive mirror systems (threshold theory) or dysfunctional processing and representation of oneself versus others (self/other theory). This study investigated whether the tendency to experience vicarious pain corresponds to disinhibited physiological reactivity toward other's emotions, and/or greater empathic mimicry of other's physiological state (respiratory behavior) during fear, pain, and positive emotion. Fifty healthy individuals aged 18-55 years (23 vicarious pain responders) completed empathy- and anxiety-related questionnaires, and a film task. Respiration was measured noninvasively with piezoelectric respiration belts while participants viewed emotional film clips depicting three emotions (fear/pain/positive) interspersed with neutral clips. The emotional stimuli depicted scenes in which the characters showed increases or decreases in respiration. The results suggest that vicarious pain responders do not mimic emotional respiratory behavior.

High-resolution separations could be achieved in less than 1.5 min, this being faster than other currently available techniques such as size exclusion ultraperformance liquid chromatography (SE-UPLC). Moreover, the operating pressure was less than 200 kPa, which eliminated the need for an expensive high-pressure pump and chromatography system.

{"title": "Use of a Novel, Portable, LED-Based Capillary Refill Time Simulator within a Disaster Triage Context.", "abstract": "Introduction A simple, portable capillary refill time (CRT) simulator is not commercially available. This device would be useful in mass-casualty simulations with multiple volunteers or mannequins depicting a variety of clinical findings and CRTs. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a prototype CRT simulator in a disaster simulation context.\nA CRT prototype simulator was developed by embedding a pressure-sensitive piezo crystal, and a single red light-emitting diode (LED) light was embedded, within a flesh-toned resin. The LED light was programmed to turn white proportionate to the pressure applied, and gradually to return to red on release. The time to color return was adjustable with an external dial. The prototype was tested for feasibility among two cohorts: emergency medicine physicians in a tabletop exercise and second year medical students within an actual disaster triage drill. The realism of the simulator was compared to video-based CRT, and participants used a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from \"completely artificial\" to \"as if on a real patient.\" The VAS evaluated both the visual realism and the functional (eg, tactile) realism. Accuracy of CRT was evaluated only by the physician cohort. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistics, and mean Cohen's Kappas were used to describe inter-rater reliability.\nThe CRT simulator was generally well received by the participants. The simulator was perceived to have slightly higher functional realism (P=.06, P=.01) but lower visual realism (P=.002, P=.11) than the video-based CRT. Emergency medicine physicians had higher accuracy on portrayed CRT on the simulator than the videos (92.6% versus 71.1%; P<.001). Inter-rater reliability was higher for the simulator (0.78 versus 0.27; P<.001).\nA simple, LED-based CRT simulator was well received in both settings. Prior to widespread use for disaster triage training, validation on participants' ability to accurately triage disaster victims using CRT simulators and video-based CRT simulations should be performed.

{"title": "Parental Influences and the Relationship to their Children's Physical Activity Levels.", "abstract": "Engaging in a physically active lifestyle relates positively to current health and reduces chances of chronic diseases in the future. Given escalating health care costs, it is paramount to reduce illnesses associated with a lack of physical activity and thus critical to identify factors that influence physical activity - especially in children, with the opportunity for a lifetime impact. One of these influencing factors may be parents/guardians. The intent of this study was to examine the relationship between children's physical activity levels and parental factors including parental physical activity, support/encouragement, restrictiveness, and self-reported participation. Data was collected from 15 child-parent pairs with children ranging in age from 7 to 10 years. Daily physical activity levels were determined from pedometer data using a Piezo SC-Step Pedometer. Number of steps and moderate and vigorous physical activity were extracted from the pedometers and levels of support/encouragement, restrictiveness, and participation were quantified from parents' self-reported responses to a questionnaire created for this study. Pearson Product correlation analyses were carried out between: the children's and parent steps (r = -0.069; p = 0.597); children's steps and parent's self-reported encouragement/support (r = 0.045, p = 0.563); children's steps and parents' self-reported restrictiveness (r = -.0254, p = 0.820); and children's steps and parents' self-reported participation (r = -0.002, p = 0.503). The lack of significant relationships among these variables implies that more complex interactions occur between children and their parents regarding physical activity with children's participation influenced by other factors.", "journal": "International journal of exercise science", "date": "2017-03-28", "authors": ["Nathan AChiarlitti", "Angela MKolen"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Modified Continuum Mechanics Modeling on Size-Dependent Properties of Piezoelectric Nanomaterials: A Review.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric nanomaterials (PNs) are attractive for applications including sensing, actuating, energy harvesting, among others in nano-electro-mechanical-systems (NEMS) because of their excellent electromechanical coupling, mechanical and physical properties. However, the properties of PNs do not coincide with their bulk counterparts and depend on the particular size. A large amount of efforts have been devoted to studying the size-dependent properties of PNs by using experimental characterization, atomistic simulation and continuum mechanics modeling with the consideration of the scale features of the nanomaterials. This paper reviews the recent progresses and achievements in the research on the continuum mechanics modeling of the size-dependent mechanical and physical properties of PNs. We start from the fundamentals of the modified continuum mechanics models for PNs, including the theories of surface piezoelectricity, flexoelectricity and non-local piezoelectricity, with the introduction of the modified piezoelectric beam and plate models particularly for nanostructured piezoelectric materials with certain configurations. Then, we give a review on the investigation of the size-dependent properties of PNs by using the modified continuum mechanics models, such as the electromechanical coupling, bending, vibration, buckling, wave propagation and dynamic characteristics.

{"title": "Accurate Determination of the Frequency Response Function of Submerged and Confined Structures by Using PZT-Patches\u2020.", "abstract": "To accurately determine the dynamic response of a structure is of relevant interest in many engineering applications. Particularly, it is of paramount importance to determine the Frequency Response Function (FRF) for structures subjected to dynamic loads in order to avoid resonance and fatigue problems that can drastically reduce their useful life. One challenging case is the experimental determination of the FRF of submerged and confined structures, such as hydraulic turbines, which are greatly affected by dynamic problems as reported in many cases in the past. The utilization of classical and calibrated exciters such as instrumented hammers or shakers to determine the FRF in such structures can be very complex due to the confinement of the structure and because their use can disturb the boundary conditions affecting the experimental results. For such cases, Piezoelectric Patches (PZTs), which are very light, thin and small, could be a very good option. Nevertheless, the main drawback of these exciters is that the calibration as dynamic force transducers (relationship voltage/force) has not been successfully obtained in the past. Therefore, in this paper, a method to accurately determine the FRF of submerged and confined structures by using PZTs is developed and validated. The method consists of experimentally determining some characteristic parameters that define the FRF, with an uncalibrated PZT exciting the structure. These parameters, which have been experimentally determined, are then introduced in a validated numerical model of the tested structure. In this way, the FRF of the structure can be estimated with good accuracy. With respect to previous studies, where only the natural frequencies and mode shapes were considered, this paper discuss and experimentally proves the best excitation characteristic to obtain also the damping ratios and proposes a procedure to fully determine the FRF. The method proposed here has been validated for the structure vibrating in air comparing the FRF experimentally obtained with a calibrated exciter (impact Hammer) and the FRF obtained with the described method. Finally, the same methodology has been applied for the structure submerged and close to a rigid wall, where it is extremely important to not modify the boundary conditions for an accurate determination of the FRF. As experimentally shown in this paper, in such cases, the use of PZTs combined with the proposed methodology gives much more accurate estimations of the FRF than other calibrated exciters typically used for the same purpose.

The possibility of down scaling, parallelization of cantilever arrays and the absence of optical interference associated imaging artifacts have led to an increased research interest in these methods. However, for multifrequency AFM, the optimization of the transducer layout on the cantilever for higher order modes has not been addressed. To fully utilize an integrated piezoelectric transducer, this work alters the layout of the piezoelectric layer to maximize both the deflection of the cantilever and measured piezoelectric charge response for a given mode with respect to the spatial distribution of the strain. On a prototype cantilever design, significant increases in actuator and sensor sensitivities were achieved for the first four modes without any substantial increase in sensor noise.

In this paper, we highlight the crucial influence of the GaN nanowire-metal Schottky nanocontact on the energy harvesting efficiency. Three different metals, p-type doped diamond, PtSi and Pt/Ir, have been investigated. By using an atomic force microscope equipped with a Resiscope module, we demonstrate that the harvesting of piezo-generated energy is up to 2.4 times more efficient using a platinum-based Schottky nanocontact compared to a doped diamond-based nanocontact. In light of Schottky contact characteristics, we evidence that the conventional description of the Schottky diode cannot be applied. The contact is governed by its nanometer size. This specific behaviour induces notably a lowering of the Schottky barrier height, which gives rise to an enhanced conduction. We especially demonstrate that this effective thinning is directly correlated with the improvement of the energy harvesting efficiency, which is much pronounced for Pt-based Schottky diodes.

Firstly, the influence of the reactive interphase on macroscopic melt flow behavior was studied. The in situ generated interphase from coupling reactions in bilayers significantly contributed to overall viscoelastic responses in both linear and nonlinear regimes. Specifically, under fast extensional flows, the reactively healed bilayer showed enhanced strain hardening mainly due to the formed graft copolymers in the interphase. Secondly, the evolution of a reactive interphase and its effects on microscopic dynamics and structural properties were further probed using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). Interestingly, the reactive interphase drastically altered the dielectric responses of the bilayer upon healing, manifesting in the distinct interfacial relaxation/polarization. The relaxation strength of the interfacial polarization increased linearly as a function of reaction time, and was further improved by increasing the number of layers. In agreement with the rheology, DRS also demonstrated the retarded microscopic dynamics of a reactive interphase in healed bilayers. Using the dielectric molecular relaxation spectrum as a probe for the structure, the effects of the reactive interphase on charge dynamics and the resulting structural properties of bilayers were further evaluated. These findings are aimed at providing a better understanding of the effects of the reactive interphase on rheology, dynamics and dielectric properties, towards controlling the interface/interphase in multi micro-/nano-layered polymer structures and for further applications.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2017-03-21", "authors": ["BoLu", "KhalidLamnawar", "AbderrahimMaazouz"], "doi": "10.1039/c6sm02658c"}

Researchers have strived to optimize the electromechanical structures and to design necessary external power management circuits, aiming to deliver high power and rectified outputs ready for serving as batteries. Complex deformation of the mechanical structure results in charges with opposite polarities appearing on same surface, leading to current loss in the attached metal electrode. External power management circuits such as rectifiers comprise diodes that consume power and have undesirable forward bias. To address the above issues, we devise a novel integrated piezoelectric energy harvesting device that is structured by stacking a layer of quantum dots (QDs) and a layer of piezoelectric material. We find that the QD can rectify electrical charges generated from the piezoelectric material because of its adaptable conductance to the electrochemical potentials of both sides of the QDs layer, so that electrical current causing energy loss on the same surface of the piezoelectric material can be minimized.

The aim of this clinical pilot study was to determine the accuracy of this technique. STROBE guidelines were followed. Ten patients were selected and treated. Using new dedicated planning software, the piezocision cuts were properly positioned in virtual models. A surgical guide was designed and printed with slots to guide the scalpel blade first and then the piezoelectric micro-saw. The slots limit the cortical incisions coronally and apically, and also limit the depth of penetration of the piezoelectric micro-saw. The patients underwent CBCT before and immediately after surgery, and the pre- and postoperative images were matched. Using software, the planned piezocisions were compared to the actual piezocisions, and the entry point and depth deviations were measured. Descriptive statistics, kappa statistics, and the t-test were used for the data analysis. The mean deviation at the entry point was 0.67mm (range 0.06-1.44mm, standard deviation 0.31). The mean depth deviation was 0.54mm (range 0.17-0.80mm, standard deviation 0.21). The limits of the use of computer-guided piezocision are set by the maximum deviation observed; thus a safety distance of 1.5mm should be considered, which confirms that this innovative technique is clinically applicable.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2017-03-18", "authors": ["MCassetta", "MIvani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2017.02.1273"}

{"title": "Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Nanobalance (EQCN) Based Biosensor for Sensitive Detection of Antibiotic Residues in Milk.", "abstract": "An electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), which provides real-time analysis of dynamic surface events, is a valuable tool for analyzing biomolecular interactions. EQCN biosensors are based on mass-sensitive measurements that can detect small mass changes caused by chemical binding to small piezoelectric crystals. Among the various biosensors, the piezoelectric biosensor is considered one of the most sensitive analytical techniques, capable of detecting antigens at picogram levels. EQCN is an effective monitoring technique for regulation of the antibiotics below the maximum residual limit (MRL). The analysis of antibiotic residues requires high sensitivity, rapidity, reliability and cost effectiveness. For analytical purposes the general approach is to take advantage of the piezoelectric effect by immobilizing a biosensing layer on top of the piezoelectric crystal. The sensing layer usually comprises a biological material such as an antibody, enzymes, or aptamers having high specificity and selectivity for the target molecule to be detected. The biosensing layer is usually functionalized using surface chemistry modifications. When these bio-functionalized quartz crystals are exposed to a particular substance of interest (e.g., a substrate, inhibitor, antigen or protein), binding interaction occurs. This causes a frequency or mass change that can be used to determine the amount of material interacted or bound. EQCN biosensors can easily be automated by using a flow injection analysis (FIA) setup coupled through automated pumps and injection valves. Such FIA-EQCN biosensors have great potential for the detection of different analytes such as antibiotic residues in various matrices such as water, waste water, and milk.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2017-03-17", "authors": ["SunilBhand", "Geetesh KMishra"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-6911-1_18"}

The sensors are tested with acetone and ethanol in the presence of humid air. Cross-selectivity is enhanced using two different methods to modify the basic response of the PVDF-HFP/CB sensing platform. In method I, the adsorption properties of PVDF-HFP/CB are altered by adding a polyethylene oxide (PEO) layer or by treating with infrared (IR). In method II, the effects of the interaction of acetone and ethanol are enhanced by adding diethylene carbonate (DEC) or PEO dispersed in DEC (PEO/DEC) to the film. The results suggest the approaches used in method I alter the composite ability to adsorb acetone and ethanol, while in method II, they alter the transduction characteristics of the composite. Using these approaches, sensor relative response to acetone was increased by 89% compared with the PVDF-HFP/CB untreated film, whereas sensor relative response to ethanol could be decreased by 57% or increased by 197%.

One of the key enabling features is the use of coded excitation to reduce the excitation peak power to less than 4.8W (24 Vpp and 200mA) so that racetrack coils with dimensions 3.2\u00d718mm", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-03-08", "authors": ["JIsla", "FCegla"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.02.009"}

This method combines functionalities of the force-distance-based atomic force microscopy and amplitude-modulation (AM) KPFM to perform measurements in single-pass mode. During the tip-sample approach-and-retract cycle, nanomechanical measurements are performed for the retract part of nanoindentation, and the CPD is measured by the lifted probe with a constant tip-sample distance. We compare the performance of the proposed method with the conventional KPFMs by mapping the CPD of multilayer graphene deposited on n-doped silicon, and the results demonstrate that MP-KPFM has comparable performance to AM-KPFM. In addition, the experimental results of a custom-fabricated polymer grating with heterogeneous surfaces validate the multiparametric imaging capability of the MP-KPFM.

{"title": "Multifunctional Nano-engineered Polymer Surfaces with Enhanced Mechanical Resistance and Superhydrophobicity.", "abstract": "This paper presents a multifunctional polymer surface that provides superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning functions together with an enhancement in mechanical and electrical performance. These functionalities are produced by nanoimprinting high aspect ratio pillar arrays on polymeric matrix incorporating functional reinforcing elements. Two distinct matrix-filler systems are investigated specifically, Carbon Nanotube reinforced Polystyrene (CNT-PS) and Reduced Graphene Oxide reinforced Polyvinylidene Difluoride (RGO-PVDF). Mechanical characterization of the topographies by quantitative nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests are performed to evidence a considerable increase in stiffness, Young's modulus and critical failure load with respect to the pristine polymers. The improvement on the mechanical properties is rationalized in terms of effective dispersion and penetration of the fillers into the imprinted structures as determined by confocal Raman and SEM studies. In addition, an increase in the degree of crystallization for the PVDF-RGO imprinted nanocomposite possibly accounts for the larger enhancement observed. Improvement of the mechanical ruggedness of functional textured surfaces with appropriate fillers will enable the implementation of multifunctional nanotextured materials in real applications.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2017-03-07", "authors": ["Jaime JHern\u00e1ndez", "Miguel AMoncl\u00fas", "Iv\u00e1nNavarro-Baena", "FelipeViela", "Jon MMolina-Aldareguia", "IsabelRodr\u00edguez"], "doi": "10.1038/srep43450"}

Lamb waves and shear horizontal (SH) waves, two commonly used types of waves in plates, provide different benefits for the detection of various types of defects and material degradation. However, there are few sensors that can detect both Lamb and SH waves and also resolve their modal content, namely the wavenumber-frequency spectrum. A sensor that can detect both waves is desirable to take full advantage of both types of waves in order to improve sensitivity to different discontinuity geometries.

Gold colloidal nanoparticles (Au NPs) were prepared via laser ablation of metallic targets in liquid media. The active Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was used as an irradiation source. Then, PVDF was dissolved in Au NPs colloidal solution at 30% wt for the synthesis of Au NPs/PVDF composite nanofibers by electrospinning. The optical absorbance spectra of Au NPS and the polymeric solutions were obtained by the UV-Visible spectroscopy. Moreover, the morphology of Au NPS, nanostructures of fibers and diameter size distribution of nanofibers were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Transmitted Electron Microscopy methods. The crystallinity and piezoelectricity of PVDF and Au NPs/PVDF composite nanofibers mats were measured by X-Ray Diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared methods. Subsequently, in vitro cytocompatibility was evaluated by MTT assay and the attachment and morphology of PC-12 cells cultured on scaffolds were studied.

{"title": "A combined genetic algorithm and finite element method for the determination of a practical elasto-electric set for 1-3 piezocomposite phases.", "abstract": "1-3 piezocomposites are widely used in ultrasonic transducers, particularly for imaging applications. The fabrication process is often based on the dice and fill method, leading to a periodic structure. This process can modify the initial properties of the two phases due to the machining of the piezoelectric bulk ceramic and setting of the polymer. A method is proposed to directly determine a practical set for 1-3 piezocomposite properties and all the elastic, dielectric and piezoelectric parameters of the two piezoelectric (11 constants) and inert phases (3 constants). This method is based on a fitting process of the electrical impedance as a function of frequency (one thickness and two lateral modes). For this purpose, a genetic algorithm coupled with a finite element method (GA/FEM) was used in an iterative process to deduce all these parameters. This method was first performed on a numerical phantom (Pz21/epoxy resin). Comparisons showed that the GA/FEM obtained a good set of the 14 parameters, and the accuracy of several parameters was discussed. Finally, the GA/FEM algorithm was applied to a fabricated 1-3 piezocomposite (dice and fill method). The results showed that the fabrication process introduced several changes in the properties of the two phases (in particular, the dielectric constants of the ceramic and one elastic constant of the polymer) compared to the initial commercial data, while keeping the identical thickness coupling factor at 64%.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-03-04", "authors": ["RRouffaud", "A-CHladky-Hennion", "FLevassort"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.02.015"}

For pure phases, the relative energies of PVDF strands (i.e. absent van der Walls bonding) agree well between DFT (using a GGA or a hybrid functional) and DFTB. For crystals, DFTB needs to be calibrated due to deficiencies in the treatment of vdW interactions. Defect formation energies were computed in large-scale DFTB simulations. For single chain vacancies, they are 0.41, 0.59, 0.08 and 0.40 eV per monomer removed in \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 PVDF, respectively.

Interstitial defects were found to be unstable and convert into vacancies. The relatively high defect formation energies (vs. kT at room temperature) imply that phase purity is feasible in PVDF.

This paper presents the design, modeling, and testing of a new flexure-based compound alignment stage for R2RPE. In this design, the alignment stage has 5-DOF (Degree of Freedom) motions for compensating the alignment errors and only the rotation motion about the y-axis is redundant. The stage is constructed in series by four key parts and adopts a compounded flexure structure to achieve a great performance. Each part is driven by a piezoelectric actuator or voice coil motor actuator to obtain one or two DOF motion. In order to enlarge the travel range of the alignment stage, a Scott-Russell mechanism and a lever mechanism are arranged in series for forming a two-grade displacement amplifier to overcome the small displacement of the actuator. Based on the pseudo-rigid-body simplification method, alignment models are developed. Kinematic and static analyses are conducted to evaluate the performance of the stage in terms of travel range and input stiffness.

The use of an optical source with short coherence-time allows performing interferometric measurements without spurious resonance effects due to multiple parallel interfaces of highly planar slabs, furthermore selecting the plane/layer to be monitored.

{"title": "Acoustothermal tweezer for droplet sorting in a disposable microfluidic chip.", "abstract": "Precise control over droplet position within a microchannel is fundamental to droplet microfluidic applications. This article proposes acoustothermal tweezer for the control of droplet position, which is based on thermocapillary droplet migration actuated by acoustothermal heating. The proposed system comprises an acoustothermal heater, which is composed of a slanted finger interdigital transducer patterned on a piezoelectric substrate and a thin PDMS membrane, and a PDMS microchannel. In the proposed system, droplets moving in a droplet microfluidic chip experience spatiotemporally varying thermal stimuli produced by acoustothermal heating and thus migrate laterally. In comparison to previous methods for droplet sorting, the acoustothermal tweezer offers significant advantages: first, the droplet position can be manipulated in two opposite directions, which enables bidirectional droplet sorting to one of three outlets downstream; second, precise control over the droplet position as well as improved droplet lateral displacement on the order of hundreds of micrometers can be achieved in a deterministic manner, thereby enabling multichannel droplet sorting; third, the PDMS microfluidic chip is disposable and thus can be easily replaced since it is attached to the substrate by reversible bonding, which allows the acoustothermal heater to be reused.

While the low negative charge of the COOH-SAM is not able to support oriented attachment of the particles, the strongly negatively charged sulfonated polyelectrolyte leads to texturing of the ZnO film.

This fills the gap of interpretability between the medical and the engineering approaches. We collected locomotion data from 47 subjects with knee osteoarthritis and 47 healthy subjects. Osteoarthritis subjects were recruited from hospital clinics and GP surgeries, and age and sex matched healthy subjects from the local community. Subjects walked on a walkway equipped with two force plates with piezoelectric 3-component force sensors. Parameters of the vertical, anterior-posterior, and medio-lateral ground reaction forces, such as mean value, push-off time, and slope, were extracted. Then random forest regressors map those parameters via rule induction to the degree of knee osteoarthritis. To boost generalisation ability, a subject-independent protocol is employed.

Given the importance of rock bolts, the research outlined in this paper attempts to develop a portable non-destructive evaluation method for assessing the length of installed rock bolts for inspection purposes. Traditionally, piezoelectric elements or hammer impacts were used to perform non-destructive evaluation of rock bolts. However, such methods suffered from many major issues, such as the weak energy generated and the requirement for permanent installation for piezoelectric elements, and the inconsistency of wave generation for hammer impact. In this paper, we proposed a portable device for the non-destructive evaluation of rock bolt conditions based on a giant magnetostrictive (GMS) actuator. The GMS actuator generates enough energy to ensure multiple reflections of the stress waves along the rock bolt and a lead zirconate titantate (PZT) sensor is used to detect the reflected waves. A new integrated procedure that involves correlation analysis, wavelet denoising, and Hilbert transform was proposed to process the multiple reflection signals to determine the length of an installed rock bolt. The experimental results from a lab test and field tests showed that, by analyzing the instant phase of the periodic reflections of the stress wave generated by the GMS transducer, the length of an embedded rock bolt can be accurately determined.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-03-01", "authors": ["MingzhangLuo", "WeijieLi", "BoWang", "QingqingFu", "GangbingSong"], "doi": "10.3390/s17030444\n10.1016/S1365-1609(03)00027-3\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2005.08.001\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2006.12.002\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2010.07.006\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2011.08.007\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2011.12.010\n10.1016/j.tust.2011.11.009\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000767\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2009.08.005\n10.1023/A:1022031720855\n10.1016/j.matdes.2006.12.016\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055001\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.05.003\n10.3390/s17010005\n10.3390/s16091529\n10.3390/s150305151\n10.3390/s120100518\n10.12989/sss.2016.17.2.313\n10.1016/j.sna.2010.12.025\n10.1109/97.923042"}
{"title": "Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors for the Oil Industry.", "abstract": "With the oil and gas industry growing rapidly, increasing the yield and profit require advances in technology for cost-effective production in key areas of reservoir exploration and in oil-well production-management. In this paper we review our group's research into fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and their applications in the oil industry, especially in the well-logging field. FBG sensors used for seismic exploration in the oil and gas industry need to be capable of measuring multiple physical parameters such as temperature, pressure, and acoustic waves in a hostile environment. This application requires that the FBG sensors display high sensitivity over the broad vibration frequency range of 5 Hz to 2.5 kHz, which contains the important geological information. We report the incorporation of mechanical transducers in the FBG sensors to enable enhance the sensors' amplitude and frequency response. Whenever the FBG sensors are working within a well, they must withstand high temperatures and high pressures, up to 175 \u00b0C and 40 Mpa or more. We use femtosecond laser side-illumination to ensure that the FBGs themselves have the high temperature resistance up to 1100 \u00b0C. Using FBG sensors combined with suitable metal transducers, we have experimentally realized high- temperature and pressure measurements up to 400 \u00b0C and 100 Mpa. We introduce a novel technology of ultrasonic imaging of seismic physical models using FBG sensors, which is superior to conventional seismic exploration methods. Compared with piezoelectric transducers, FBG ultrasonic sensors demonstrate superior sensitivity, more compact structure, improved spatial resolution, high stability and immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI).

Instead of commonly used piezoelectric transducers, fiber-optic based ultrasound detection is applied. The optical fibers are shaped into rings and mainly receive ultrasonic signals stemming from the ring symmetry axes. Four concentric fiber-optic rings with varying diameters are used in order to increase the image quality. Imaging artifacts, originating from the off-axis sensitivity of the rings, are reduced by coherence weighting. We discuss the working principle of the system and present experimental results on tissue mimicking phantoms.

{"title": "Damage detection of fatigue cracks under nonlinear boundary condition using subharmonic resonance.", "abstract": "In recent years, the nonlinear ultrasonic technique has been widely utilized for detecting fatigue crack, one of the most common forms of damage. However, one of limitations associated with this technique is that nonlinearities can be produced not only by damage but also by various intrinsic effects such as boundary conditions. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the application of a nonlinear ultrasonic subharmonic method for detecting fatigue cracks with nonlinear boundary conditions. The fatigue crack was qualitatively modeled as two elastic, frictionless half spaces that enter into contact during vibration and where the contact obeys the basic Hertz contact law. The nonlinear ordinary differential equation drawn from the developed model was solved with the method of multiple scales. The threshold of subharmonic generation was studied. Different threshold behaviors between the nonlinear boundary condition and the fatigue crack were found that can be used to distinguish the source of nonlinear subharmonic features. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments using an aluminum plate with a fatigue crack were conducted to quantitatively verify the subharmonic resonance range. Two surface-bonded piezoelectric transducers were used to generate and receive ultrasonic wave signals. The experimental results demonstrated that the subharmonic component of the sensing signal could be used to detect the fatigue crack and further to distinguish it from inherent nonlinear boundary conditions.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2017-02-27", "authors": ["MengyangZhang", "LiXiao", "WenzhongQu", "YeLu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2017.02.001"}
{"title": "Single, simultaneous and sequential applications of ultrasonic frequencies for the elimination of ibuprofen in water.", "abstract": "The study is about the assessment of single and multi-frequency operations for the overall degradation of a widely consumed analgesic pharmaceutical-ibuprofen (IBP). The selected frequencies were in the range of 20-1130kHz emissions coming from probes, baths and piezo-electric transducers attached to plate-type devices. Multi-frequency operations were applied either simultaneously as \"duals\", or sequentially at fixed time intervals; and the total reaction time in all operations was 30-min. The work also covers evaluation of the effect of zero-valent iron (ZVI) on the efficiency of the degradation process and the performance of the reaction systems. It was found that low-frequency probe type devices especially at 20kHz were ineffective when applied singly and without ZVI, and relatively more effective in combined-frequency operations in the presence of ZVI. The power efficiencies of the reactors and/or reaction systems showed that 20-kHz probe was considerably more energy intensive than all others, and was therefore not used in multi-frequency operations. The most efficient reactor in terms of power consumption was the bath (200kHz), which however provided insufficient mineralization of the test chemical. The highest percentage of TOC decay (37%) was obtained in a dual-frequency operation (40/572kHz) with ZVI, in which the energy consumption was neither low nor exceptionally too high. A sequential operation (40+200kHz) in that respect was more efficient, because it required much less energy for a similar TOC decay performance (30%). In general, the degradation of IBP increased with increased power consumption, which in turn reduced the sonochemical yield. The study also showed that advanced Fenton reactions with ZVI were faster in the presence of ultrasound, and the metal was very effective in improving the performance of low-frequency operations.", "journal": "Ultrasonics sonochemistry", "date": "2017-02-27", "authors": ["AsuZiylan-Yavas", "Nilsun HInce"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.01.032"}

However, significant contradictions may be found and, consequently, this method has not yet been widely developed. In this paper, four MBRs equipped with hollow-fibre polyvinylidene fluoride ultrafiltration membranes were operated continuously. The cleaning method applied consisted of sonication at low power (15 W) with different frequencies (20, 25, 30, and 40 kHz) for each module and aerated backwashing. The different MBRs were analysed comparatively between them and with a conventional MBR in order to check the effects of the irradiated waves on membrane integrity, effluent quality and process performance. Effluent turbidity and chemical oxygen demand, total and volatile suspended solid concentration and activated sludge viscosity were affected by biomass fragmentation or membrane cake removal, mainly at lower frequencies. The best transmembrane pressure control was achieved at the frequency of 20 kHz without a significant effect on membrane integrity. The results showed that under these operational conditions, no negative effects on effluent quality or membrane integrity were found, suggesting that this method was suitable for this type of membrane.", "journal": "Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research", "date": "2017-02-25", "authors": ["L MRuiz", "J IPerez", "AG\u00f3mez", "ALetona", "M AG\u00f3mez"], "doi": "10.2166/wst.2016.566"}

Little has been written regarding ultrasonic system for temporomandibular joint surgery (TMJ). In this prospective study we describe the use of piezoelectric device for ankylosis of the TMJ.\nWe enrolled in this study 19 patients, 10 males and 9 females, mean (SD) age 24.6 (7.6) years, affected by unilateral ankylosis of TMJ who were surgically managed between January 2009 and December 2014 by interpositional arthroplasty with temporomyofascial muscle flap. We adopted in all cases a preauricular approach with temporal extension. The ankylotic block was removed with piezoelectric device in 9 patients and using traditional rotary bur in 10 cases. We investigated and compared the following parameters as surgical outcomes: intraoperative bleeding, duration of operation, incidence of infection, postoperative swelling and hematoma, mouth opening, nerve impairment and rate of recurrence.\nWe noticed a substantial reduction in bleeding with the piezoelectric bone cutter when compared to traditional mechanical surgery (103\u00a0ml versus 117\u00a0ml; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, we did not report any severe bleeding from the pterygoid plexus or maxillary artery. Operating time was longer in the piezo group (101\u00a0min versus 88\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was a lower incidence of postoperative hematoma and swelling following piezoosteotomy. However, regarding postoperative nerve impairment and infection we did not observe any differences between the two groups. At one year follow-up mean (SD) mouth opening was 34 (4.3) mm. We did not report recurrence of the disease.\nPiezoelectric bone removal for the release of ankylosis of the TMJ is associated with minimal bleeding and few postoperative complications. We believe that piezosurgery allows surgeons to achieve better results compared to a traditional surgery. It is a possible alternative due to the clinical benefits demonstrated.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2017-02-23", "authors": ["GiuseppeSpinelli", "DomenicoValente", "GiudittaMannelli", "MircoRaffaini", "FrancescoArcuri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2016.12.004"}

For this purpose, a high-performance piezoelectric sensor is presented in this paper. To adapt the high static and dynamic stress environment in slope engineering, two key techniques, namely, the self-structure pressure distribution method (SSPDM) and the capacitive circuit voltage distribution method (CCVDM) are employed in the design of the sensor. The SSPDM can greatly improve the compressive capacity and the CCVDM can quantitatively decrease the high direct response voltage. Then, the calibration experiments are conducted via the independently invented static and transient mechanism since the conventional testing machines cannot match the calibration requirements. The sensitivity coefficient is obtained and the results reveal that the sensor has the characteristics of high compressive capacity, stable sensitivities under different static preload levels and wide-range dynamic measuring linearity. Finally, to reduce the measuring error caused by charge leakage of the piezoelectric element, a low-frequency correction method is proposed and experimental verified. Therefore, with the satisfactory static and dynamic properties and the improving low-frequency measuring reliability, the sensor can complement dynamic monitoring capability of the existing landslide monitoring and forecasting system.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-02-22", "authors": ["MingLi", "WeiCheng", "JiangpanChen", "RuiliXie", "XiongfeiLi"], "doi": "10.3390/s17020394\n10.1007/s00254-006-0294-1\n10.1016/S0013-7952(97)00085-9\n10.1016/j.enggeo.2004.10.013\n10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61087-5\n10.1016/j.enggeo.2009.02.014\n10.1007/s11431-008-6013-2\n10.3390/s7040473\n10.1088/0964-1726/14/1/025\n10.1016/j.ijmst.2015.11.024\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.019\n10.1007/s11433-006-2005-z\n10.1007/s11431-016-0526-9\n10.1007/s11431-016-6053-y\n10.1088/0964-1726/19/6/065026\n10.1515/eng-2015-0046\n10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.02.014\n10.1016/S1674-5264(09)60113-7\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2014.01.007\n10.1016/j.ijmst.2015.07.010"}

Effective hydrophilization and functionalization of PVDF membrane was realized via polydopamine (PDA) deposition, thus overcoming the drawbacks of hydrophobic substrates including poor water permeability, inert property as well as severe non-specific adsorption. The following polyallylamine (PAH) coupling was carried out at pH 10.0, where unprotonated amine groups on PAH chains were more prone to couple with PDA. This membrane adsorber could remain 75% of protein binding capacity when NaCl concentration increased from 0 to 150mM, while its protein binding capacity was independent of flow rate from 10 to 100 membrane volume (MV)/min due to its high mechanical strength (tensile strength: 43.58\u00b12.30MPa).

{"title": "Surface acoustic waves induced micropatterning of cells in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels.", "abstract": "Acoustic force patterning is an emerging technology that provides a platform to control the spatial location of cells in a rapid, accurate, yet contactless manner. However, very few studies have been reported on the usage of acoustic force patterning for the rapid arrangement of biological objects, such as cells, in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. In this study, we report on a bio-acoustic force patterning technique, which uses surface acoustic waves (SAWs) for the rapid arrangement of cells within an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). A proof-of-principle was achieved through both simulations and experiments based on the in-house fabricated piezoelectric SAW transducers, which enabled us to explore the effects of various parameters on the performance of the built construct. The SAWs were applied in a fashion that generated standing SAWs (SSAWs) on the substrate, the energy of which subsequently was transferred into the gel, creating a rapid, and contactless alignment of the cells (<10 s, based on the experimental conditions). Following ultraviolet radiation induced photo-crosslinking of the cell encapsulated GelMA pre-polymer solution, the patterned cardiac cells readily spread after alignment in the GelMA hydrogel and demonstrated beating activity in 5-7 days. The described acoustic force assembly method can be utilized not only to control the spatial distribution of the cells inside a 3D construct, but can also preserve the viability and functionality of the patterned cells (e.g. beating rates of cardiac cells). This platform can be potentially employed in a diverse range of applications, whether it is for tissue engineering, in vitro cell studies, or creating 3D biomimetic tissue structures.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2017-02-15", "authors": ["Shahid MNaseer", "AmirManbachi", "MohamadmahdiSamandari", "PhilippWalch", "YuanGao", "Yu ShrikeZhang", "FaridehDavoudi", "WesleyWang", "KarenAbrinia", "Jonathan MCooper", "AliKhademhosseini", "Su RyonShin"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/aa585e"}

Varying the thickness of the Rh6G layer (submonolayer to multiple layers) on the PVDF layer revealed the existence of multiple Rh6G species on the surface, similar to previous reports on glass. Excitation spectra show that J-type excitons are not responsible for an emission enhancement. Trends in the fluorescence emission intensity show that the surface roughness of the PVDF layer prevents the Rh6G molecules from organizing the way they would on a smooth glass surface. The PVDF surface roughness preserves the emissive monomers and excited-state excimers of Rh6G while reducing the self-quenching of aggregates. Coupled with this is an internal reflection effect that causes light to be trapped between the Rh6G/PVDF and PVDF/glass interfaces.

The hypersound (\u2248GHz) is generated by a designed piezoelectric nano-electromechanical resonator, which directly induces normal/shear stress and \"molecular bombardment\" effects on the bilayer membranes, and creates reversible temporal nanopores improving the membrane permeability. Both theory analysis and cellular uptake experiments of exogenous compounds prove the high delivery efficiency of hypersonic poration. Since target molecules in cells are accumulated with the treatment, the delivered amount can be controlled by tuning the treatment time. Furthermore, owing to the intrinsic miniature of the resonator, localized drug delivery at a confined spatial location and tunable arrays of the resonators that are compatible with multiwell plate can be achieved.

Only a few dozen single-layer van der Waals solids have been subject to considerable research focus, although there are likely to be many more that could have superior properties. To identify a broad spectrum of layered materials, we present a novel data mining algorithm that determines the dimensionality of weakly bonded subcomponents based on the atomic positions of bulk, three-dimensional crystal structures. By applying this algorithm to the Materials Project database of over 50,000 inorganic crystals, we identify 1173 two-dimensional layered materials and 487 materials that consist of weakly bonded one-dimensional molecular chains. This is an order of magnitude increase in the number of identified materials with most materials not known as two- or one-dimensional materials. Moreover, we discover 98 weakly bonded heterostructures of two-dimensional and one-dimensional subcomponents that are found within bulk materials, opening new possibilities for much-studied assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. Chemical families of materials, band gaps, and point groups for the materials identified in this work are presented. Point group and piezoelectricity in layered materials are also evaluated in single-layer forms.

No monomer chloroprene was detected in the bags analyzed. All of the dimers gradually increased once bags were filled with nitrogen due to diffusion from the bag surface. Flushing the bags with nitrogen reduced their concentrations, but was not effective for removing the contaminants. When the bags that had been flushed with nitrogen 5 times were left for 24 h, they increased again, indicating that the dimers were constantly emitted from the ALTEF bag surface.

{"title": "Optical Trap Loading of Dielectric Microparticles In Air.", "abstract": "We demonstrate a method to trap a selected dielectric microparticle in air using radiation pressure from a single-beam gradient optical trap. Randomly scattered dielectric microparticles adhered to a glass substrate are momentarily detached using ultrasonic vibrations generated by a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Then, the optical beam focused on a selected particle lifts it up to the optical trap while the vibrationally excited microparticles fall back to the substrate. A particle may be trapped at the nominal focus of the trapping beam or at a position above the focus (referred to here as the levitation position) where gravity provides the restoring force. After the measurement, the trapped particle can be placed at a desired position on the substrate in a controlled manner. In this protocol, an experimental procedure for selective optical trap loading in air is outlined. First, the experimental setup is briefly introduced. Second, the design and fabrication of a PZT holder and a sample enclosure are illustrated in detail. The optical trap loading of a selected microparticle is then demonstrated with step-by-step instructions including sample preparation, launching into the trap, and use of electrostatic force to excite particle motion in the trap and measure charge. Finally, we present recorded particle trajectories of Brownian and ballistic motions of a trapped microparticle in air. These trajectories can be used to measure stiffness or to verify optical alignment through time domain and frequency domain analysis. Selective trap loading enables optical tweezers to track a particle and its changes over repeated trap loadings in a reversible manner, thereby enabling studies of particle-surface interaction.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2017-02-13", "authors": ["HaesungPark", "Thomas WLeBrun"], "doi": "10.3791/54862"}

The ability to control the position of individual vortices is necessary in order to study how vortices interact with each other, with the lattice, and with other magnetic objects. Here, we present a protocol for vortex manipulation in thin superconducting films by local contact, without applying current or magnetic field. Vortices are imaged using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), and vertical stress is applied to the sample by pushing the tip of a silicon chip into the sample, using a piezoelectric element. Vortices are moved by tapping the sample or sweeping it with the silicon tip. Our method allows for effective manipulation of individual vortices, without damaging the film or affecting its topography. We demonstrate how vortices were relocated to distances of up to 0.8 mm. The vortices remained stable at their new location up to five days. With this method, we can control vortices and move them to form complex configurations.

However, most are non-biodegradable, which is unfavorable for many biomedical applications. Although biodegradable polymers offer significant benefits, they are still limited by their weak mechanical properties, which is an obstacle for use as a biomaterial that requires high strength. To overcome the current limitations of biodegradable monofilaments, a novel solid-state drawing (SSD) process was designed to significantly improve the mechanical properties of both PA and poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) monofilaments in this study. Both PA and PLLA monofilaments exhibited more than two-fold increased tensile strength and a highly reduced thickness using SSD. In X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses, it was determined that SSD could not only promote the \u03b1-crystal phase, but also smoothen the surface of PLLA monofilaments. To apply SSD-monofilaments with superior properties to cardiovascular stents, a shaped-annealing (SA) process was designed as the follow-up process after SSD. Using this process, three types of vascular stents could be fabricated, composed of SSD-monofilaments: double-helix, single-spring and double-spring shaped stents. The annealing temperature was optimized at 80 \u00b0C to minimize the loss of mechanical and physical properties of SSD-monofilaments for secondary processing. All three types of vascular stents were tested according to ISO 25539-2. Consequently, it was confirmed that spring-shaped stents had good recovery rate values and a high compressive modulus.

The model of the stator under the action of DC voltage is presented first, and the results of the model are compared versus a similar model using the commercial finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics. One can observe that there is a difference of less than 5% between the displacements of the stator using the proposed model and the one with COMSOL Multiphysics. After that, the model of the stator under the action of AC voltages is presented. The time domain analysis shows the generation of the traveling wave in the stator surface. One can use this model to accurately calculate the stator surface velocities, elliptical motion of the stator surface and the amplitude and shape of the stator traveling wave.

Wireless power transfer from dedicated sources can overcome these difficulties, and in this work, the use of targeted ultrasonic power transfer as a possible method for remote powering of sensor nodes is investigated. A powering system for pipeline monitoring sensors is described and studied experimentally, with a pair of identical, non-inertial piezoelectric transducers used at the transmitter and receiver. Power transmission of 18mW (Root-Mean-Square) through 1m of a118mm diameter cast iron pipe, with 8mm wall thickness is demonstrated. By analysis of the delay between transmission and reception, including reflections from the pipeline edges, a transmission speed of 1000m/s is observed, corresponding to the phase velocity of the L(0,1) axial and F(1,1) radial modes of the pipe structure. A reduction of power delivery with water-filling is observed, yet over 4mW of delivered power through a fully-filled pipe is demonstrated.

In this study, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), and BmCPV-protein interaction on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BmCPV-PI-PVDF) methods were employed to screen the interacting proteins of BmCPV, and several proteins including integrin beta and receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1) were identified as the candidate interacting proteins for establishing the infection of BmCPV. The infectivity of BmCPV was investigated in vivo and in vitro by RNA interference (RNAi) and antibody blocking methods, and the results showed that the infectivity of BmCPV was significantly reduced by either small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of integrin beta and RACK1 or antibody blocking of integrin beta and RACK1. The expression level of integrin beta or RACK1 is not the highest in the silkworm midgut which is a principal target tissue of BmCPV, suggesting that the molecules other than integrin beta or RACK1 might play a key role in determining the tissue tropism of BmCPV infection.

This study investigates the generation of narrowband tone-burst waves using a fiber laser of the type that is widely used in laser beam machining. Fiber lasers can emit laser pulses with a high repetition rate on the order of MHz, and the laser pulses can be modulated to a burst train by external signals. As a consequence of the burst laser emission, a narrowband tone-burst elastic wave is generated. We experimentally confirmed that the elastic waves agreed well with the modulation signals in time domain waveforms and their frequency spectra, and that waveforms can be controlled by the generation technique. We also apply the generation technique to defect imaging with a scanning laser source. In the experiments, with small laser emission energy, we were not able to obtain defect images from the signal amplitude due to low signal-to-noise ratio, whereas using frequency spectrum peaks of the tone-burst signals gave clear defect images, which indicates that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved in the frequency domain by using this technique for the generation of narrowband elastic waves.

In mammals, they play important roles in basic physiological functions including proprioception, sensation of touch, and vascular development. However, basic receptor properties like the gating mechanism, the interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and the response to mechanical stimulation, remain poorly understood. Here, we establish an atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based assay to mechanically stimulate Piezo1 receptors in living animal cells, while monitoring receptor activation in real-time using functional calcium imaging. Our experiments show that in the absence of ECM proteins Piezo1 receptors are relatively insensitive to mechanical forces pushing the cellular membrane, whereas they can hardly be activated by mechanically pulling the membrane. Yet, if conjugated with Matrigel, a mix of ECM proteins, the receptors become sensitized. Thereby, forces pulling the cellular membrane activate the receptor much more efficiently compared to pushing forces. Finally, we found that collagen IV, a component of the basal lamina, which forms a cohesive network and mechanical connection between cells, sensitizes Piezo1 receptors to mechanical pulling.", "journal": "Nano letters", "date": "2017-02-07", "authors": ["Benjamin MGaub", "Daniel JM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00177"}

Filtration experiments showed that, sludge cake layer on the coated membrane could be more easily washed off, and moreover, the remained flux ratio (RFR) of the coated membrane was obviously improved as compared with the control membrane.

Based on the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) approaches, quantification of interfacial interactions between foulants and membranes in three different scenarios was achieved. It was revealed that there existed a repulsive energy barrier when a particle foulant adhered to membrane surface, and the enhanced electrostatic double layer (EL) interaction and energy barrier should be responsible for the improved antifouling ability of the coated membrane.

The aim of this study was therefore to determine, with the help of the resonance frequency (Osstell mentor), which technique of implant site preparation (piezo surgery, conventional, under-preparation, bone compaction, osteodistraction) and macro-geometry is able to improve implant stability in type IV cancellous bone.\n10 pig ribs were prepared with a surgical pre-drilled guide, calibrated for a correct implant positioning. On each rib, 5 implant sites (one for each technique) were prepared. Successively, 50 conical implants (Tekka Global D) were inserted and measured with the resonance frequency to evaluate the primary stability. Data collected were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test whether the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) values of the five techniques were significantly different.\nThe results showed that no significant differences among the ISQ values of the five techniques used were found. Also, no significant differences in the macro-geometry of the two types of compared implants were observed. However, the macro-geometry of Tekka implants, characterized by a double condensing thread, seems to provide greater ISQ values than those of single thread implants when using the same technique.\nIn light of these preliminary data, it is conceivable that in cases of reduced stability, such as those occurring with a type IV bone, all means ameliorating the primary stability and accelerating the osseointegration can be utilized.", "journal": "Medicina oral, patologia oral y cirugia bucal", "date": "2017-02-06", "authors": ["GFalisi", "MSeverino", "CRastelli", "SBernardi", "SCaruso", "MGalli", "LLamazza", "CDi Paolo"], "doi": "10.4317/medoral.21286"}

{"title": "A computational study on the role of noncovalent interactions in the stability of polymer/graphene nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Understanding the interaction between graphene and polymers is of essential interest when designing novel nanocomposites with reinforced mechanical and electrical properties. In this computational study, the interaction of pristine graphene (PG) and graphene oxide (GO) with a series of functional groups, representative of the functionalised buildings blocks occurring in different polymers, and attached to aliphatic and aromatic chains, is analyzed using dispersion-corrected semi-empirical methods (PM6-D3H4X) and density functional theory calculations with empirical dispersion corrections. Functional groups include alkyl, hydroxyl, aldehyde, carboxyl, amino and nitro groups, and the binding energies of these groups with graphene derivatives (PG and GO) are determined. Nitro- and carbonyl groups display stronger interactions in both aliphatic and aromatic chains. The importance of dispersion-type and non-covalent interactions (NCI) in general, which typically, double the interaction energies, is revealed. The results are interpreted in an extensive NCI analysis in order to characterize the different types of NCI, providing a better understanding of the nature of the interaction (\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, CH-\u03c0 bonding, H-bonding and lone pair-\u03c0 interaction) at stake. In order to highlight the influence of polymer structure/conformation on top of that of their functional groups, the binding of three polymers, polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), on pristine graphene is also investigated. Our calculations indicate that, although all polymers exhibit evident attractive interactions with the graphene sheet, the overall interaction is strongly influenced by the specific polymer structure. Thus, three main conformations of PVDF (the so-called \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, \u03b5 conformations) are analyzed and we find that, although the \u03b1-conformer with a trans-gauche-trans-gauche (TGTG') conformation is the lowest energy conformer, the \u03b2-conformation of PVDF with the hydrogen atoms facing the graphene (\"F-up\") has the strongest interaction with the graphene surface among the polymers under consideration.

Each image feature (atom or molecule) is first identified in the image. The locations of each feature's nearest neighbors are used to measure the local distortion at that location. The local distortion map across the image is simultaneously fit to our distortion model, which includes thermal drift in addition to piezoelectric actuator hysteresis and creep. The image coordinates of the features and image pixels are corrected using an inverse transform from the distortion model. We call this technique the thermal-drift, hysteresis, and creep transform. Performing the correction in real space allows defects, domain boundaries, and step edges to be excluded with a spatial mask. Additional real-space image analyses are now possible with these corrected images. Using graphite(0001) as a model system, we show lattice fitting to the corrected image, averaged unit cell images, and symmetry-averaged unit cell images.

{"title": "Impedance-Based Pre-Stress Monitoring of Rock Bolts Using a Piezoceramic-Based Smart Washer-A Feasibility Study.", "abstract": "Pre-stress degradation or looseness of rock bolts in mining or tunnel engineering threatens the stability and reliability of the structures. In this paper, an innovative piezoelectric device named a \"smart washer\" with the impedance method is proposed with the aim of developing a real-time device to monitor the pre-stress level of rock bolts. The proposed method was verified through tests on a rock bolt specimen. By applying high-frequency sweep excitations (typically >30 kHz) to the smart washer that was installed on the rock bolt specimen, we observed that the variation in impedance signatures indicated the rock bolt pre-stress status. With the degradation of rock bolt pre-stress, the frequency in the dominating peak of the real part of the electrical impedance signature increased. To quantify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a normalized root mean square deviation (RMSD) index was developed to evaluate the degradation level of the rock bolt pre-stress. The experimental results demonstrated that the normalized RMSD-based looseness index, which was computed from the impedance value detected by the \"smart washer\", increased with loss of the pre-stress of the rock bolt. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively detect the degradation of rock bolt pre-stress, as demonstrated by experiments.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2017-01-31", "authors": ["BoWang", "LinshengHuo", "DongdongChen", "WeijieLi", "GangbingSong"], "doi": "10.3390/s17020250\n10.1016/0148-9062(95)00021-8\n10.1016/S1365-1609(03)00027-3\n10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2003)15:3(212)\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2005.08.001\n10.1016/j.ijrmms.2006.12.002\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2010.07.006\n10.1016/j.jappgeo.2011.12.010\n10.1016/j.tust.2011.11.009\n10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000767\n10.3390/s121013617\n10.3390/s141019897\n10.3390/s16101765\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.02.017\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.02.014\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.04.020\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/4/045008\n10.1088/0964-1726/21/11/115022\n10.1177/1045389X13498317\n10.1177/1475921716655498\n10.1088/0964-1726/25/9/095003\n10.1177/1045389X9400500102\n10.1177/05831024030356001\n10.1007/BF01337937"}

By itself it offers opportunities in new-type non-volatile memory and energy storage applications. A highly useful and scientifically puzzling feature of this material is the competition between the ferro- and antiferroelectric phases due to their energetic proximity, which leads to a challenge in understanding of the critical phenomena driving the formation of the antiferroelectric structure. We show that application of hydrostatic pressure drastically changes the character of critical lattice dynamics and enables the soft-mode-driven incommensurate phase transition sequence in lead zirconate. In addition to the long known cubic and antiferroelectric phases we identify the new non-modulated phase serving as a bridge between the cubic and the incommensurate phases.

While most dual-modality systems utilize piezoelectric transducers, all-optical systems can obtain broadband high-resolution data with hands-free operation. Previously described reflection-mode all-optical laser-ultrasound (LUS) systems use a confocal source and detector; however, angle-dependent raypaths are lost in this configuration. As a result, the overall imaging aperture is reduced, which becomes increasingly problematic with depth. We present a reflection-mode nonconfocal LUS and PA imaging system that uses signals recorded on all-optical hardware to create angle-dependent images. We use reverse-time migration and time reversal to reconstruct the LUS and PA images. We demonstrate this methodology with both a numerical model and tissue phantom experiment to image a steep-curvature vessel with a limited aperture 2-cm beneath the surface. Nonconfocal imaging demonstrates improved focusing by 30% and 15% compared to images acquired with a single LUS source in the numerical and experimental LUS images, respectively. The appearance of artifacts is also reduced.

On participant level (combining data from both laboratory and free-living experiments), with ten-fold leave-one-out cross-validation, chewing were recognized with average F-score of 96.28% and the resultant area under the curve was 0.97, which are higher than any of the previously reported results. A multivariate regression model was used to estimate chew counts from segments classified as chewing with an average mean absolute error of 3.83% on participant level. These results suggest that the proposed system is able to identify chewing segments in the presence of speech and motion artifacts, as well as automatically and accurately quantify chewing behavior, both under controlled laboratory conditions and unrestricted free-living.", "journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["MuhammadFarooq", "EdwardSazonov"], "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2016.2640142"}

As this controller provides good disturbance rejection and is robust against plant uncertainties it is appropriate for the vibration mitigation in structures. In this paper, an FOPID controller is designed to adjust the contact force of piezoelectric friction dampers for semi-active control of base-isolated structures during far-field and near-field earthquake excitations. A multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm is employed to tune the controller parameters. Considering the resulting Pareto optimal front, the best input for the FOPID controller is selected. For seven pairs of earthquakes and nine performance indices, the performance of the proposed controller is compared with those provided by several well-known control techniques. According to the simulation results, the proposed controller performs better than other controllers in terms of simultaneous reduction of the maximum base displacement and story acceleration for various types of earthquakes. Also, it provides acceptable responses in terms of inter-story drifts, root mean square of base displacements and floor acceleration. In addition, the evaluation of robustness for a stiffness uncertainty of \u00b110% indicates that the proposed controller gives a robust performance against such modeling errors.", "journal": "ISA transactions", "date": "2017-01-24", "authors": ["Abbas-AliZamani", "SaeedTavakoli", "SadeghEtedali"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isatra.2017.01.012"}

To date, induction-based turbines form the mainstay of this effort, but turbines are noisy, perceived as unattractive, a potential hazard to bats and birds, and their height hampers deployment in residential settings. Several groups have proposed that artificial plants containing piezoelectric elements may harvest wind energy sufficient to contribute to a carbon-neutral energy economy. Here we measured energy conversion by cottonwood-inspired piezoelectric leaves, and by a \"vertical flapping stalk\"-the most efficient piezo-leaf previously reported. We emulated cottonwood for its unusually ordered, periodic flutter, properties conducive to piezo excitation. Integrated over 0\u00b0-90\u00b0 (azimuthal) of incident airflow, cottonwood mimics outperformed the vertical flapping stalk, but they produced << daW per conceptualized tree. In contrast, a modest-sized cottonwood tree may dissipate ~ 80 W via leaf motion alone. A major limitation of piezo-transduction is charge generation, which scales with capacitance (area). We thus tested a rudimentary, cattail-inspired leaf with stacked elements wired in parallel. Power increased systematically with capacitance as expected, but extrapolation to acre-sized assemblages predicts << daW.

The simultaneous achievement of high piezoresistive sensitivity and large strain ranges for CPNCs currently presents a great challenge and solving this challenge may extend the applications of CPNCs with self-diagnosis capabilities to many structural health-monitoring (SHM) systems. This paper reports a facile strategy for fabricating highly piezoresistive and tough poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based CPNCs by tuning the interactions between the polymer matrix and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) using an ionic liquid (IL) as an interface linker/modifier. As a result, the presence of IL achieves homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in PVDF but causes a reduced number of CNT-CNT ohmic contacts with higher electrical contact resistance. According to the lower initial resistivity, piezoresistive sensitivity is greatly improved, and the gauge factor (GF) varies from 7 to 60 upon the addition of IL. It is also shown that IL tunes PVDF-CNT interfacial bonding and, as an effective interface linker/modifier, achieves significantly improved sensing strain ranges (increased from ca. 6 to 21%) and toughness (elongation at break increases from 6 to 130%) of CPNCs.

Application of those techniques is mainly limited by the big losses of ultrasonic signals due to attenuation and mismatch of the acoustic impedances of ultrasonic transducers and air. One of the ways to solve this problem is by application of novel more efficient piezoelectric materials like lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) type crystals. The objective of this research was the development and investigation of low frequency (<50 kHz) wide band air-coupled ultrasonic transducers and arrays with an improved performance using PMN-32%PT crystals. Results of finite element modelling and experimental investigations of the developed transducers and arrays are presented.

In this study we evaluated detection of bladder contractions using a novel piezoelectric catheter-free pressure sensor placed in a suburothelial bladder location in animals.\nWired prototypes of the pressure monitor were implanted into 2 nonsurvival (feline and canine) and one 13-day survival (canine) animal. Vesical pressures were obtained from the device in both suburothelial and intraluminal locations and simultaneously from a pressure sensing catheter in the bladder. Intravesical pressure was monitored in the survival animal over 10 days from the suburothelial location and necropsy was performed to assess migration and erosion.\nIn the nonsurvival animals, the average correlation between device and reference catheter data was high during both electrically stimulated bladder contractions and manual compressions (r = 0.93\u00b10.03, r = 0.89\u00b10.03).

In the present study, an attempt has been made to select specific membrane with improved property of attaching diversified bacteria.

Among these, 20% W/W PSF showed maximum attachment. Therefore, membrane prepared with other materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyether sulfone (PES) were used with the same concentration (20% W/W) to check their improved bacterial attachment property. Comparative study of bacterial attachment on three different membranes revealed that PVDF possessed the highest affinity towards both the groups of bacteria. This property was confirmed by different analytical methods viz. contact angle, atomic force microscopy, zeta potential, and flux study and further validated with seawater samples collected from seven sites of western coast and Lakshadweep island of India, using Biolog EcoPlate\u2122.

A total of 160 root samples were prepared and instrumented by new (n = 80) and worn inserts (n = 80) at different working parameters (tip angulation, power setting, lateral force). Roughness change (Rc) on root surfaces after instrumentation was examined by a contact profilometer.\nStatistically significant differences were found between the mean ERs of new and worn tips (p < 0.0001). The various combinations of the assessed working parameters showed synergistic effects resulting in a wide range of root surface roughness. The present study found the higher Rc in the group with a 45\u00b0 angulation, (P10) high power setting and 1.0 N lateral force (subgroup 8) when compared to other groups. Among the groups, the worn scaler tips subgroup 8 showed a higher Rc (5.692 \u00b1 0.81) when compared to new scaler tips subgroup 8 (4.798 \u00b1 0.51; p < 0.001).\nThe findings of the present study highlighted that scaler tip wear strongly influences the root surface roughness when used at higher tip angulation, lateral force and power settings.

{"title": "Nanogenerators for Self-Powered Gas Sensing.", "abstract": "Looking toward world technology trends over the next few decades, self-powered sensing networks are a key field of technological and economic driver for global industries. Since 2006, Zhong Lin Wang's group has proposed a novel concept of nanogenerators (NGs), including piezoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, which could convert a mechanical trigger into an electric output. Considering motion ubiquitously exists in the surrounding environment and for any most common materials used every day, NGs could be inherently served as an energy source for our daily increasing requirements or as one of self-powered environmental sensors. In this regard, by coupling the piezoelectric or triboelectric properties with semiconducting gas sensing characterization, a new research field of self-powered gas sensing has been proposed. Recent works have shown promising concept to realize NG-based self-powered gas sensors that are capable of detecting gas environment without the need of external power sources to activate the gas sensors or to actively generate a readout signal. Compared with conventional sensors, these self-powered gas sensors keep the approximate performance. Meanwhile, these sensors drastically reduce power consumption and additionally reduce the required space for integration, which are significantly suitable for the wearable devices. This paper gives a brief summary about the establishment and latest progress in the fundamental principle, updated progress and potential applications of NG-based self-powered gas sensing system.

Taking into account that the senescent endothelial cells have been implicated in the genesis or promotion of age-related cardiovascular disease, we hypothesized an active role of PPIs in senescent cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in gene expression occurring in senescent and non-senescent human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) following Omeprazole (OPZ) or Lansoprazole (LPZ) treatment. Here, we show that atherogenic response is among the most regulated processes in PPI-treated HCAECs. PPIs induced down-regulation of anti-atherogenic chemokines (CXCL11, CXCL12 and CX3CL1) in senescent but not in non-senescent cells, while the same chemokines were up-regulated in untreated senescent cells. These findings support the hypothesis that up-regulated anti-atherogenic chemokines may represent a defensive mechanism against atherosclerosis during cellular senescence, and suggest that PPIs could activate pro-atherogenic pathways by changing the secretory phenotype of senescent HCAECs. Moreover, the genes coding for fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 (PIEZO2) were modulated by PPIs treatment with respect to untreated cells.

The PAAm microgels are synthesized by inverse miniemulsion polymerization, and first the parameters are investigated which are suited to obtain particles in the desired size range, 100-200 nm, with narrow size distribution. Amino functions are then imparted to the microgels applying the Hofmann reaction. The modification is confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, ninhydrin test, and elemental analysis. In addition, functionalized microgels are characterized by dynamic light scattering. The amino-functionalized PAAm microgels are then immobilized on pre-modified PVDF membrane having aldehyde functionalities on the surface. Afterward, unreacted aldehyde groups still present on the membrane where quenched by ethanolamine and the enzyme lipase from Candida rugosa (LCR) is subsequently immobilized on the microgels loaded PVDF membrane via glutaraldehyde cross-linking, exploiting the free amino groups on immobilized microgels. Catalytic efficiency of LCR immobilized by this strategy is evaluated using para-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate and compared with LCR directly immobilized on PVDF membrane without microgels.

To pursue this goal, a piezo actuator-driven pulsed water jet (ADPJ) system was introduced in this study. This study included 42 patients, who suffered aSAH and underwent clipping surgery. Eleven patients underwent surgery with the assistance of the ADPJ system (ADPJ group). In the other 31 patients, surgery was performed without the ADPJ system (Control group). The ADPJ system was used for clot removal and aneurysmal dissection. The clinical impact of the ADPJ system was judged by comparing the rate of premature rupture, degree of clot removal, and clinical outcomes. Intraoperatively, a premature rupture was encountered in 18.2 and 25.8% of cases in the ADPJ and control groups, respectively. Although the differences were not statistically significant, intraoperative observation suggested that the ADPJ system was effective in clot removal and dissection of aneurysms in a safe manner.

Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), body movement, and calculated sleep-related parameters from the EarlySense (ES) sensor were compared to data simultaneously generated by the gold standard, polysomnography (PSG).

A Si nanoparticle anode prepared with citric acid (CA) has better capacity retention than one containing 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BA), but both electrodes outperform Si-PVDF. The Si-CA anode has an initial specific capacity of 3530 mA h/g and a first cycle efficiency of 82%. Surprisingly, the Si-CA electrode maintains a high specific capacity of \u223c2200 mA h/g after 250 cycles, corresponding to 64% capacity retention, which is similar to the Si prepared with long-chain poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). On the contrary, the silicon electrode prepared with PVDF has a fast capacity fade and retains only 980 mA h/g after 50 cycles. The IR and XPS data show that the Si-CA electrode has an SEI composed primarily of lithium citrate during the first 50 cycles, resulting from the electrochemical reduction of citric acid.

{"title": "A novel method for the rapid detection of microbes in blood using pleurocidin antimicrobial peptide functionalized piezoelectric sensor.", "abstract": "The rapid detection of microbes is critical in clinical diagnosis and food safety. Culture-dependent assays are the most widely used microbial detection methods, but these assays are time-consuming. In this study, a rapid microbial detection method was proposed using a pleurocidin/single-walled carbon nanotubes/interdigital electrode-multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (pleurocidin/SWCNT/IDE-MSPQC) sensor. The selected pleurocidin antimicrobial peptide served as a recognition probe that exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and the SWCNT acted as the electronic transducer and cross-linker for the immobilization of pleurocidin on the IDE.

This paper shows how the surface chemistry evolution of polysulfone (PSF) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes can lead to the formation of distinct membrane properties when exposed to sodium hypochlorite solutions. The surface physicochemical evolutions of aged membranes are characterized based on chemical composition (ATR-FTIR and XPS), water contact angle analysis, and surface zeta potential test. The results indicate the ageing mechanism and evolutions between PSF and PVDF membranes are totally different. In addition, the retention ability and fouling propensity of the aged membrane are also investigated by three different kinds of foulant (Dextran/HA/BSA). Surface hydrophilization of aged PVDF membrane enhanced its retention toward neutral (Dextran) and hydrophilic charged foulant (BSA), but the fouling type of aged PVDF membranes remained the same, in spite of the initial flux increasing greatly. In terms of PSF membranes, pore enlargement could be verified by a seemingly inconsistent result of dextran sieving experiments and the decreased HA rejection rate. Moreover, the increased negative charge on aged PSF membrane surface have a great impact on its sieving property and fouling propensity, especially for the charged and hydrophilic BSA. With the regression data of Hermia's model, the main fouling type of aged PSF membranes was proven changed to pore blocking, and the changes can ascribe to its altered surface chemical characteristic and pore diameter.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2016-12-03", "authors": ["YangZhang", "JieWang", "FeiGao", "YongshengChen", "HongweiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.022"}

The proposed system exhibits the advantages of simple structure, high mechanical integration, lack of electromagnetic interference, and lack of lubrication requirement, and hence shows potential application to robotic rovers for planetary exploration. The tracked mobile system is comprised of a sandwich actuating mechanism and a metal track. The actuating mechanism includes a sandwich piezoelectric transducer and two annular parts symmetrically placed at either end of the transducer, while the metal track is tensioned along the outer surfaces of the annular parts. Traveling waves with the same rotational direction are generated in the two annular parts, producing the microscopic elliptical motions of the surface particles on the annular parts. In this situation, if the pre-load is applied properly, the metal track can be driven by friction force to achieve bidirectional movement. At first, the finite element method was adopted to conduct the modal analysis and harmonic response analysis of the actuating mechanism, and the vibration characteristics were measured to confirm the operating principle. Then the optimal driving frequency of the system prototype, namely 35.1kHz, was measured by frequency sensitivity experiments.

The selected materials, besides different mechanical features (stiffness from few kPa to 1.6MPa), showed a wide range of acoustic properties (speed of sound from 1022 to 1555m/s, acoustic impedance from 1.02 to 1.67MRayl and attenuation coefficient from 0.2 to 36.5dB/cm), corresponding to ranges in which natural soft tissues can fall.

The general strength of biosensor approaches is the avoidance of time-consuming and cost-intensive labeling procedures of the analytes. In this chapter, we give insight into a mass-sensitive surface-acoustic wave (SAW) biosensor, which represents an elegant and highly sensitive method to investigate binding events at a molecular level. The principle of SAW technology is based on the piezoelectric properties of the sensors, so as to binding events and their accompanied mass increase at the sensor surface are detectable by a change in the oscillation of the surface acoustic wave. In combination with model membranes, transferred to the sensor surface, the analytical value of SAW biosensors has strongly been increased and extended to different topics of biomedical investigations, including antibiotic research. The interaction with the bacterial membrane or certain target structures therein is the essential mode of action for various antibacterial compounds. Beside targeted interaction, an unspecific membrane binding or membrane insertion of drugs can contribute to the antibacterial activity by changing the lateral order of membrane constituents or by interfering with the membrane barrier function. Those pleiotropic effects are hardly to illustrate in the bacterial systems and need a detailed view at the in vitro level. Here, we illustrate the usefulness of a SAW biosensor in combination with model membranes to investigate the mode of membrane interaction of antibiotic active peptides.

These active stabilization techniques can also aid other biophysical assays that would benefit from improved laser stability and/or \u00c5-scale sample stability, such as atomic force microscopy and super-resolution imaging.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2016-11-16", "authors": ["Stephen ROkoniewski", "Ashley RCarter", "Thomas TPerkins"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4939-6421-5_4"}

The resonance frequency and EMCC of the proposed transducer are calculated according to frequency equations, which are obtained from the equivalent circuit of the transducer, and the results indicate that EMCC of the tangentially polarized cylindrical transducer is much higher than that of the cylindrical transducer polarized in radial direction. Furthermore, the Finite Element Method (FEM) model of the transducer is established and used for numerical simulation of the vibration models and the optimum configuration parameters. On the basis of those theoretical results, serials of prototype transducers are manufactured with an inner tangential polarized piezoelectric tube connecting with different outer metal cylindrical shells. The admittance characteristics of the fabricated transducers measured by Impedance Analyzer clearly demonstrate that the resonance frequencies of the transducers are in good agreement with those of simulation results, and the effective EMCC of transducers varies with the material of metal cylindrical shell, in which aluminum metal shell possesses the highest EMCC.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-11-12", "authors": ["LongyangJia", "GuangbingZhang", "XiaofengZhang", "YuYao", "ShuyuLin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.10.013"}

Estrogen and progesterone have neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain damage, however the exact mechanisms of neuroprotection and signaling pathways is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the possible regulatory effects of a combined steroid treatment on extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways after cerebral ischemia.\nAdult male Wistar rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) using an intraluminal filament technique for 1\u00a0h followed by 23\u00a0h reperfusion. Estrogen and progesterone were immediately injected after tMCAO subcutaneously. Sensorimotor functional tests and the infarct volume were evaluated 24\u00a0h after ischemia. Protein expression of calpain-1 and Fas receptor (FasR), key members of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, were determined in the penumbra region of the ischemic brain using western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL staining.\nNeurological deficits and infarct volume were significantly reduced following hormone therapy. Calpain-1 up-regulation and caspase-3 activation were apparent 24\u00a0h after ischemia in the peri-infarct area of the cerebral cortex. Steroid hormone treatment reduced infarct pathology and attenuated the induction of both proteases.

It is common practice to select transducers based on their sensitivity at the central frequency and under normal incidence. However, the bandwidth and angular sensitivity play an equally important role in establishing the quality and accuracy of the reconstructed images. Here, we developed a calibrated optoacoustic characterization method specifically tailored for broadband measurements of the angular transducer sensitivity (directivity). Ultrawideband omnidirectional optoacoustic responses were generated by uniformly illuminating thin absorbing sutures with nanosecond laser pulses and characterized with a needle hydrophone. This calibrated optoacoustic source was used to characterize the frequency dependence of the angular response by a conventional piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (cMUT) with similar size and central frequency. Furthermore, both transducers had no preamplification electronics directly attached to the detection elements. While the PZT presented a 7.8 dB sensitivity advantage at normal incidence, it was able to provide detectable signal-to-noise levels only at incidence angles of up to 20 deg whereas the cMUT maintained reasonable sensitivity levels and broadband response at incidence angles of 40 deg and beyond. We further experimentally showcase a reduction in the limited-view image artifacts resulting from the broader acceptance angle of the cMUT.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical optics", "date": "2016-11-11", "authors": ["JohannesRebling", "OmriWarshavski", "CyrilMeynier", "DanielRazansky"], "doi": "10.1117/1.JBO.22.4.041005"}

The thermal and acoustic responses of the materials may reflect the important research parameters such as penetration depth, power consumption, and temperature change used for the practical models of the system. This paper emphasizes the approach for orthopedic application where the bone densities were considered in simulation to designate the type of human bones.\nThermal energy pulses were applied in order to study the penetration depth, the maximum temperature change; spatially and dynamically, and the acoustic pressure distribution over the bone thickness. The study was performed to optimize the amount of energy introduced into the materials that generate the temperature value for high resolution beyond the noise level.\nThree different energy pulses were used; 1\u00a0J, 3\u00a0J and 5\u00a0J. The thermal energy applied to the four bone materials, cancellous bone, cortical bone, red bone marrow, and yellow bone marrow were producing relative changes in temperature. The maximum change ranges from 0.5\u00a0K to 2\u00a0K for the applied pulses. The acoustic pressure also ranges from 210 to 220\u00a0dB among the various types of bones.\nThe results obtained from simulation suggest that a practical model utilizing infra-red scanning probe and piezoelectric devices may serve for the orthopedic diagnostic approach.

With this idea in mind, the development of a High Fundamental Frequency (HFF) piezoelectric immunosensor for the sensitive detection of tuberculosis was undertaken. A 38 kDa protein secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was first selected as the target biomarker. Then, specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were obtained. Myc-31 MAb, which showed the highest affinity to the analyte, was employed to set up a reference enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a limit of detection of 14 ng mL-1 of 38 kDa antigen.\nFor the development of the HFF piezoelectric immunosensor, 100 MHz quartz crystals were used as transducer elements. The gold electrode surface was functionalized by covalent immobilization of the target biomarker through mixed self-assembled monolayers (mSAM) of carboxylic alkane thiols. A competitive immunoassay based on Myc-31 MAb was integrated with the transducer as sensing bio-recognition event. Reliable assay signals were obtained using low concentrations of antigen for functionalization and MAb for the competitive immunoassay. Under optimized conditions, the HFF immunosensor calibration curve for 38 kDa determination showed a limit of detection as low as 11 ng mL-1 of the biomarker.

{"title": "Biasing of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers.", "abstract": "Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) represent an effective alternative to piezoelectric transducers for medical ultrasound imaging applications. They are microelectromechanical devices fabricated using silicon micromachining techniques, developed in the last two decades in many laboratories. The interest for this novel transducer technology relies on its full compatibility with standard integrated circuit technology that makes it possible to integrate on the same chip the transducers and the electronics, thus enabling the realization of extremely low-cost and high-performance devices, including both 1-D or 2-D arrays. Being capacitive transducers, CMUTs require a high bias voltage to be properly operated in pulse-echo imaging applications. The typical bias supply residual ripple of high-quality high-voltage (HV) generators is in the millivolt range, which is comparable with the amplitude of the received echo signals, and it is particularly difficult to minimize. The aim of this paper is to analyze the classical CMUT biasing circuits, highlighting the features of each one, and to propose two novel HV generator architectures optimized for CMUT biasing applications. The first circuit proposed is an ultralow-residual ripple (<5 [Formula: see text]) HV generator that uses an extremely stable sinusoidal power oscillator topology. The second circuit employs a commercially available integrated step-up converter characterized by a particularly efficient switching topology. The circuit is used to bias the CMUT by charging a buffer capacitor synchronously with the pulsing sequence, thus reducing the impact of the switching noise on the received echo signals.

Monitoring sleep efficiency can provide significant information about health conditions. As an attempt to facilitate less cumbersome monitoring of sleep efficiency, our study aimed to suggest new predictors of sleep efficiency that enable reliable and unconstrained estimation of sleep efficiency during awake resting period. We hypothesized that the autonomic nervous system activity observed before falling asleep might be associated with sleep efficiency. To assess autonomic activity, heart rate variability and breathing parameters were analyzed for 5 min. Using the extracted parameters as explanatory variables, stepwise multiple linear regression analyses and k-fold cross-validation tests were performed with 240 electrocardiographic and thoracic volume change signal recordings to develop the sleep efficiency prediction model. The developed model's sleep efficiency predictability was evaluated using 60 piezoelectric sensor signal recordings. The regression model, established using the ratio of the power of the low- and high-frequency bands of the heart rate variability signal and the average peak inspiratory flow value, provided an absolute error (mean \u00b1 SD) of 2.18% \u00b1 1.61% and a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.94 (p < 0.01) between the sleep efficiency predictive values and the reference values.

To relate these acoustic measurements to cavitation development, the dynamics of the cavitation bubble structures was observed in three Newtonian, optically transparent liquids with significantly different physical properties: water, ethanol, and glycerine. Each liquid was treated at 20kHz with a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer coupled to a titanium sonotrode with a tip diameter of 40mm. Two different transducer power levels were deployed: 50% and 100%, with the maximum power corresponding to a peak-to-peak amplitude of 17\u03bcm. The cavitation structures and the flow patterns were filmed with a digital camera. To investigate the effect of distance from the ultrasound source on the cavitation intensity, acoustic emissions were measured with the cavitometer at two points: below the sonotrode and near the edge of the experimental vessel. The behaviour of the three tested liquids was very different, implying that their physical parameters played a decisive role in the establishment of the cavitation regime.

{"title": "Perturbation of a radially oscillating single-bubble by a micron-sized object.", "abstract": "A single bubble oscillating in a levitation cell is acoustically monitored by a piezo-ceramics microphone glued on the cell external wall. The correlation of the filtered signal recorded over distant cycles on one hand, and its harmonic content on the other hand, are shown to carry rich information on the bubble stability and existence. For example, the harmonic content of the signal is shown to increase drastically once air is fully dissociated in the bubble, and the resulting pure argon bubble enters into the upper branch of the sonoluminescence regime. As a consequence, the bubble disappearance can be unambiguously detected by a net drop in the harmonic content. On the other hand, we perturb a stable sonoluminescing bubble by approaching a micron-sized fiber. The bubble remains unperturbed until the fiber tip is approached within a critical distance, below which the bubble becomes unstable and disappears. This distance can be easily measured by image treatment, and is shown to scale roughly with 3-4 times the bubble maximal radius. The bubble disappearance is well detected by the drop of the microphone harmonic content, but several thousands of periods after the bubble actually disappeared. The delay is attributed to the slow extinction of higher modes of the levitation cell, excited by the bubble oscillation.

After a healing period of 16 weeks, all the implants were uncovered and evaluated regarding clinical, radiographic, and resonance frequency analysis findings. The totally implemented ridge split procedures were 26 cases including 57 implants inserted immediately at the time of surgery. The initial ridge width varied between 1 and 3.5\u200amm while the final width ranged from 5.5 to 8\u200amm. The minimum bone gain was 2.5\u200amm and the maximum value reached up to 7\u200amm. Few and insignificant clinical complications were recorded during the whole study. The survival rate was 100%.

This concept has become a target of research in biotechnology, especially in the field of bionic biology. This study measured sliding and pressing with traditional tactile sensors in order to improve a machine operator's judgment of surface roughness. Based on the theory of acoustic emission, this study combined polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a sonic transducer to produce tactile sensors that can detect surface roughness. Friction between PVDF films and experimental materials generated tiny acoustic signals that were transferred into electrical signals through a sonic transducer. The characteristics of the acoustic signals for the various materials were then analyzed. The results suggest that this device can effectively distinguish among different objects based on roughness.

However, achieving short channel on untreated glass by traditional piezoelectric inkjet printing is problematic due to the impacting and rebounding behaviors of droplet impinging on solid surface. Here a novel method was proposed to obtain short channel length on untreated glass by taking advantage of the difference in the retraction velocities on both sides of an ink droplet. In addition, droplets contact mechanism was first introduced in our work to explain the formation of short channel in the printing process. Through printing droplets array with optimized drop space and adjusting appropriate printing parameters, a 2.4\u03bcm of channel length for TFT, to the best of our knowledge, which is the shortest channel on substrate without pre-patterning, was achieved using piezoelectric inkjet printing.

The transducer consists of two piezoelectric discs with different thickness between 0 and 2.0mm and with same diameter 28mm. Its vibration characteristics of the radial and axial motions were investigated theoretically and experimentally in axisymmetric vibration modes. Theoretically, the differential equations of piezoelectric motions were solved to produce characteristic equations that provided natural frequencies and mode shapes. The range of the fundamental frequency of radial in-plane mode is 80-360kHz and that of the axial out-of-plane mode is 600-1200kHz. Experimentally, the natural frequencies and the radial in-plane motion were measured using an impedance analyzer and an in-plane laser interferometer, respectively. The results of the theoretical analysis were compared with those of a finite-element analysis and experiments, and the theoretical analysis was verified on the basis of this comparison. It was concluded that the natural frequencies of the radial modes of the transducer were not affected by the stack and thickness of piezoelectric discs; however, those of the thickness modes were affected by the stack and thickness of the piezoelectric discs.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-10-16", "authors": ["ChunguangPiao", "Jin OhKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.09.021"}

Nonlinearity of piezoelectric ultrasound transducers is a key determinant in designing a proper driving power supply. Although, the nonlinearity of piezoelectric transducer impedance has been discussed in different literatures, the trend of the nonlinearity at different frequencies with respect to excitation voltage variations has not been clearly investigated in practice. In this paper, to demonstrate how the nonlinearity behaves, a sandwich piezoceramic transducer was excited at different frequencies. Different excitation signals were generated using a linear power amplifier and a multilevel converter within a range of 30-200V. Empirical relation was developed to express the resistance of the piezoelectric transducer as a nonlinear function of both excitation voltage and resonance frequency. The impedance measurements revealed that at higher voltage ranges, the piezoelectric transducer can be easily saturated. Also, it was shown that for the developed ultrasound system composed of two transducers (one transmitter and one receiver), the output voltage measured across receiver is a function of a voltage across the resistor in the RLC branches and is related to the resonance frequencies of the ultrasound transducer.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2016-10-09", "authors": ["NegarehGhasemi", "FiruzZare", "PooyaDavari", "MahindaVilathgamuwa", "ArindamGhosh", "ChristianLangton", "PeterWeber"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2016.09.023"}

It is distinguishable from other forms of distal arthrogryposis by cleft palate and short stature. Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2). Different mutations of this gene also cause distal arthrogryposis type 5 and Marden-Walker syndrome. Dysfunction of this ion channel provides pleiotropic effects on joints, ocular muscles, and bone development. Here, we present a family with three affected individuals exhibiting multiple contractures (metacarpo-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints as well as elbow, shoulder, knee, and ankle joints), clubfeet, short stature, bifid uvula/cleft palate, and a distinct facial phenotype including ptosis. In addition, mild intellectual disability and delay in psychomotor development are obvious. The multigenerational phenotypic spectrum of Gordon syndrome is present in the 37-year-old father, his 4-year-old son and a male neonate showing typical signs of arthrogryposis in the prenatal ultrasound examination already seen at 13 week of gestation. In all affected family members, we identified the PIEZO2 mutation c.8057G>A (p.Arg2686His) by Sanger sequencing. Our analysis indicated that mild delay in psychomotor development and intellectual disability could be part of the phenotypic spectrum of Gordon syndrome. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

{"title": "Toward 4D Nanoprinting with Tip-Induced Organic Surface Reactions.", "abstract": "Future nanomanufacturing tools will prepare organic materials with complex four-dimensional (4D) structure, where the position (x, y, z) and chemical composition within a volume is controlled with sub-1 \u03bcm spatial resolution. Such tools could produce substrates that mimic biological interfaces, like the cell surface or the extracellular matrix, whose topology and chemical complexity combine to direct some of the most sophisticated biological events. The control of organic materials at the nanoscale-level of spatial resolution could revolutionize the assembly of next generation optical and electronic devices or substrates for tissue engineering or enable fundamental biological or material science investigations. Organic chemistry provides the requisite control over the orientation and position of matter within a nanoscale reference frame through the formation of new covalent bonds. Several challenges however preclude the integration of organic chemistry with conventional nanomanufacturing approaches, namely most nanolithography platforms would denature or destroy delicate organic and biologically active matter, confirming covalent bond formation at interfaces remains difficult, and finally, only a small handful of the reactions used to transform molecules in solution have been validated on surfaces. Thus, entirely new approaches, where organic transformations and spatial control are considered equally important contributors, are needed to create 4D organic nanoprinting platforms. This Account describes efforts from our group to reconcile nanolithography, and specifically massively parallel scanning probe lithography (SPL), with organic chemistry to further the goal of 4D organic nanoprinting. Massively parallel SPL involves arrays of elastomeric pyramids mounted onto piezoelectric actuators, and creates patterns with feature diameters below 50 nm by using the pyramidal tips for either the direct deposition of ink or the localized delivery of energy to a surface. While other groups have focused on tip and array architetctures, our efforts have been on exploring their use for localizing organic chemistry on surfaces with nanoscale spatial resolution in 3D. Herein we describe the use of massively parallel SPL to create covalently immobilized patterns of organic materials using thermal, catalytic, photochemical, and force-accelerated reactions. In doing so, we have developed a high-throughput protocol for confirming interfacial bond formation. These efforts have resulted in new opportunities for the preparation of glycan arrays, novel approaches for covalently patterning graphene, and a 3D nanoprinter by combining photochemical brush polymerizations with SPL. Achieving true 4D nanoprinting involves advances in surface chemistry and instrumentation development, and to this end 4D micropatterns were produced in a microfluidic photoreactor that can position polymers composed of different monomers within micrometer proximity. A substantial gap remains, however, between these current technologies and the future's 4D nanomanufacturing tools, but the marriage of SPL with organic chemistry is an important step toward this goal. As this field continues to mature we can expect bottom-up 4D nanomanufacturing to begin supplanting conventional top-down strategies for preparing electronics, bioarrays, and functional substrates. In addition, these new printing technologies may enable the preparation of synthetic targets, such as artificial biological interfaces, with a level of organic sophistication that is entirely unachievable using existing technologies.", "journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "date": "2016-09-20", "authors": ["CarlosCarbonell", "Adam BBraunschweig"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00307"}

The configurational effects of fixed partial dentures (FPDs) were explored using a multi-stage remodeling rule. Three-dimensional real-time occlusal loads during maximum voluntary clenching were measured with a piezoelectric force transducer and were incorporated into a computerized tomography-based finite element mandibular model. Virtual X-ray images were generated based on simulation and statistically correlated with clinical data using linear regressions. The strain energy density-driven remodeling parameters were regulated over the time frame considered. A linear single-stage bone remodeling algorithm, with a single set of constant remodeling parameters, was found to poorly fit with clinical data through linear regression (low [Formula: see text] and R), whereas a time-dependent multi-stage algorithm better simulated the remodeling process (high [Formula: see text] and R) against the clinical results. The three-implant-supported and distally cantilevered FPDs presented noticeable and continuous bone apposition, mainly adjacent to the cervical and apical regions. The bridged and mesially cantilevered FPDs showed bone resorption or no visible bone formation in some areas. Time-dependent variation of bone remodeling parameters is recommended to better correlate remodeling simulation with clinical follow-up.

This work focuses on the realization and testing of a new experimental setup, able to characterize volatiles which can be found in a planetary environment. In particular the enthalpy of sublimation of some dicarboxylic acids has been measured. The importance of dicarboxylic acids in planetology and astrobiology is due to the fact that they have been detected in carbonaceous chondritic material (e.g. Murchinson), among the most pristine material present in our Solar System. In this work, a sample of acid was heated in an effusion cell up to its sublimation. For a set of temperatures (from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 75\u00a0\u00b0C), the deposition rate on the PCM surface has been measured.

After thermocycling (10,000 cycles/5-55\u00b0C), specimens were immersed in 5 wt% Fuchsine solution (24 hours). Samples were sectioned and evaluated for percentage of dye penetration. Data were analyzed with an exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test and exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test (alpha\u2009=\u20090.05).\nMicroleakage was observed at the cementum-composite interface but not the enamel-composite interface. There was not a statistically significant effect of the bevel for ultrasonic scaling or for sonic toothbrushing. Data obtained with and without a bevel were combined and a statistically significant difference in microleakage between the treatment and control sides of the tooth were found for ultrasonic scaling (32.5%\u00b144.9%, n\u2009=\u200916; p\u2009=\u20090.016) but not sonic toothbrushing (2.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200941.2%, n\u2009=\u200916; p\u2009=\u20091.0).\nPiezoelectric ultrasonic scaling increased microleakage at cementum-composite interface and there was no difference in microleakage with the use of a bevel.\nPiezoelectric sonic scaling around Class V composite restorations with margins in cementum should be avoided. Beveled margins will not reduce the incidence of microleakge resulting from ultrasonic scaling in Class V restorations. Placing the apical margin of the restoration in enamel should be attempted whenever possible to prevent future microleakage.

In PA imaging, piezoelectric transducers are commonly used to detect laser-induced ultrasonic waves. However, they typically lack adequate broadband sensitivity at ultrasonic frequency higher than 100\u00a0MHz, whereas their bulky size and optically opaque nature cause technical difficulties in integrating PA imaging with conventional optical imaging modalities. To overcome these limitations, optical methods of ultrasound detection were developed and shown their unique applications in PA imaging.\nWe provide an overview of recent technological advances in optical methods of ultrasound detection and their applications in PA imaging. A general theoretical framework describing sensitivity, bandwidth, and angular responses of optical ultrasound detection is also introduced.\nOptical methods of ultrasound detection can provide improved detection angle and sensitivity over significantly extended bandwidth. In addition, its versatile variants also offer additional advantages, such as device miniaturization, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility, minimal electrical/mechanical crosstalk, and potential noncontact PA imaging.\nThe optical ultrasound detection methods discussed in this review and their future evolution may play an important role in PA imaging for biomedical study and clinical diagnosis.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2016-09-09", "authors": ["BiqinDong", "ChengSun", "Hao FZhang"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2016.2605451"}

Noise analysis of the SiNW array with and without the Ag coating in the fluidic channel shows that noise frequency peaks, resulting from the operation of a piezoelectric micropump, are eliminated using the Ag layer with two reference electrodes located at inlet and outlet.

An amphiphilic copolymer of PVDF-g-(polyacryloylmorpholine-(polyacrylic acid)) [PVDF-g-(PACMO-PAA)] was first prepared by the free radical copolymerization. Then argatroban, a commonly used anticoagulant, was successfully grafted to PVDF-g-(PACMO-PAA). Finally the obtained copolymer was casted into a flat membrane via immersion phase inversion. The as-prepared copolymer membranes show improved hydrophilicity, higher water flux and lower protein adsorption. Moreover, the hemolysis and coagulation tests for the dual functionalized PVDF membrane exhibit decreased hemolysis ratio, with prolonged plasma recalcification time, activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time.

{"title": "Effect of polyvinylidene fluoride electrospun fiber orientation on neural stem cell differentiation.", "abstract": "Electrospun polymer piezoelectric fibers can be used in neural tissue engineering (NTE) to mimic the physical, biological, and material properties of the native extracellular matrix. In this work, we have developed scaffolds based on polymer fiber architectures for application in NTE. To study the role of such three-dimensional scaffolds, a rotating drum collector was used for electrospinning poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) polymer at various rotation speeds. The morphology, orientation, polymorphism, as well as the mechanical behavior of the nonaligned and aligned fiber-based architectures were characterized. We have demonstrated that the jet flow and the electrostatic forces generated by electrospinning of PVDF induced local conformation changes which promote the generation of the \u03b2-phase. Fiber anisotropy could be a critical feature for the design of suitable scaffolds for NTEs. We thus assessed the impact of PVDF fiber alignment on the behavior of monkey neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs were seeded on nonaligned and aligned scaffolds and their morphology, adhesion, and differentiation capacities into the neuronal and glial pathways were studied using microscopic techniques. Significant changes in the growth and differentiation capacities of NSCs into neuronal and glial cells as a function of the fiber alignment were evidenced. These results demonstrate that PVDF scaffolds may serve as instructive scaffolds for NSC survival and differentiation, and may be valuable tools for the development of cell- and scaffold-based strategies for neural repair. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Uremic solute removal and water regeneration system are the most prerequisite for WAK to work properly. In this study, we designed a filtering membrane system by using immobilized urease silk fibroin filter and evaluated its comparative effectiveness with a PVDF filtering system in peritoneal dialysate regeneration system by urea removal efficacy. We evaluated this membrane's characteristic and performances by conducting SEM-EDX analyze, water-binding abilities and porosity test, removal abilities of urea, cytotoxicity assay and enzyme activity assay. Under the condition for optimization of urease, the percentage removal of urea was about 40% and 60% in 50 mg/dL urea solution by urease immobilized PVDF and silk fibroin scaffolds, respectively. The batch experimental result showed that immobilized filter removed more than 50% of urea in 50 mg/dL urea solution. In addition silk fibroin with urease filter removed 90 percent of urea in the peritoneal dialysate after 24 h filtration. We suggest that silk fibroin with urease fixation filter can be used more effectively for peritoneal dialysate regeneration system, which have hydrophilic property and prolonged enzyme activity. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The control group (CG) comprised patients who received two-implant at canine areas without ridge expansion but were all case matched to SG and served as historical cohort. In both groups, mandibular overdentures were connected to the implants with Locator attachments 3 months after implant placement. Clinical (Plaque index; PI, Gingival index; GI, Probing depth; PD, and implant stability; ISQ) and radiographic (Vertical bone loss; VBL) parameters were recorded at time of overdenture insertion (base line, T0), 6 months (T6), and 12 months (T12) after insertion.\nThe cumulative success rates were 100% and 96.4% for CG and SG, respectively, without significant difference between groups. All tested parameters increased significantly with advance of time in both groups. There was no significant difference in PI, GI, PD, and ISQ between groups. However, SG recorded significant higher VBL than CG at T6 and T12.\nExpansion of mandibular knife edge ridge and simultaneous placement of implants to retain overdentures is associated with clinic and radiographic outcomes comparable to implants placed in unexpanded ridges after 1 year.

{"title": "Imaging of surface nanobubbles by atomic force microscopy in liquids: Influence of drive frequency on the characterization of ultrasoft matter.", "abstract": "Imaging of soft matter with atomic force microscopy (AFM) is challenging due to tip-induced deformation, which convolutes with the measurement. The challenges are generally more serious in liquid environments due to a severe loss of sensitivity of the vibrating microcantilever to external forces, as well as due to the presence of undesirable mechanical resonances when piezoelectric excitation systems are used. Furthermore, the choice of imaging parameters can have a significant impact on the quality of the results, such that the customary practices used for tuning the cantilever are not always appropriate. Here we explore the influence of the chosen drive frequency on the imaging of ultrasoft matter, using surface gas nanobubbles on gold-coated glass and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as a test platform. We carry out single- and multifrequency AFM experiments using both the traditional amplitude-peak method and the recently proposed phase-slope-peak method for tuning the cantilever, as well as piezoelectric and photothermal excitation, providing an extensive discussion on the factors governing the level of tip-induced sample deformation and the quality of the phase contrast obtained for each of the methods. The general conclusion is that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach for tuning the cantilever for low-impact tapping-mode AFM, although rational optimization of the imaging process is generally possible, whereby the choice of the drive frequency plays a prominent role. The physical insight and guidelines provided here can be extremely useful for the gentle imaging of a wide range of biological and other soft materials in liquid environments. Microsc. Res.

This study also provides information about the diameter, prevalence, and course of the posterior superior alveolar artery (PSAA), and its relation to the maxillary sinus floor.\nFour hundred and thirty CBCT scans of the maxillofacial complex (860 maxillary sinuses) were reviewed. Measurements of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus and PSAA were performed on the CBCT images.\nStatistical analysis showed that dental status (edentulous, non-edentulous) of the patients had no significant effect on the lateral wall thickness. The mean thickness of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.07 mm at the second molar (M2), 1.98\u2009\u00b1\u20091.87 mm at the first molar (M1), 2.02\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53 mm at the second premolar (P2) and 2.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.25 mm at the first premolar (P1). There was statistically significant difference between the left and right sides of the maxillary sinus only at P2 (p =.043). Detection rate of the PSAA on CBCT was reported as 60.58%. The mean diameter of the artery was 1.17 mm (range 0.4-2.8 mm). There was no significant correlation between age and the size of the PSAA. The most frequent path of the PSAA was intraosseous (69.6%), followed by intrasinusal (24.3%) and superficial (6.1%). The overall mean distance of the PSAA from the floor of the maxillary sinus is 8.16 mm.\nThe results from this study suggest that using CBCT prior to the surgery provides valuable diagnostic information.

Third generation scaffolds are more of composite types to maximize biological-mechanical-chemical properties. In the present review, our focus is on the performance of micro-organism-derived polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)-polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV)-composite scaffolds with ceramics and natural polymers for tissue engineering applications with emphasis on bone tissue. We particularly emphasize on how material properties of the composites affect scaffold performance. PHA-based composites have demonstrated their biocompatibility with a range of tissues and their capacity to induce osteogenesis due to their piezoelectric properties. Electrospun PHB/PHBV fiber mesh in combination with human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) were shown to improve vascularization in engineered bone tissues. For nerve and skin tissue engineering applications, natural polymers such as collagen and chitosan remain the gold standard but there is scope for development of scaffolds combining PHAs with other natural polymers which can address some of the limitations such as brittleness, lack of bioactivity and slow degradation rate presented by the latter. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

{"title": "Comparison of conventional twist drill protocol and piezosurgery for implant insertion: an ex\u00a0vivo study on different bone types.", "abstract": "The aim of this ex\u00a0vivo study was to compare implant insertion procedures using piezosurgery and conventional drilling in different qualities of bone. Implant bed preparation time, generated heat, and primary implant stability were analyzed.\nFresh ex\u00a0vivo porcine bone block samples (cancellous, mixed, and cortical bone) were obtained. The bone quality was quantified by ultrasound transmission velocity (UTV). Each bone sample received three implants of the same diameter using each of the techniques of piezosurgery and conventional twist drills. Time for preparation was taken and the temperature while performing the osteotomy was measured using infrared spectroscopy. The primary implant stability after osteotomy was measured using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and extrusion torque (ET). ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test was carried out to compare the values for the three different groups.\nThe UTV values strongly correlated with the density of the bone samples. There was a significant increase in time (threefold, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 [302\u00a0s vs. 122\u00a0s in cortical bone]) but no difference in the temperature for the piezo group (~37\u00b0C in cortical bone). Regardless of the osteotomy technique, there was a statistically significant increase in RFA and ET values in implants inserted in cancellous bone (RFA: piezo 77, drill 76; ET: piezo 22, drill 21), mixed bone (RFA: piezo 85, drill 86; ET: piezo 105, drill 61), and cortical bone (RFA: piezo 90, drill 87; ET piezo 184, drill 79) samples, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In between the different osteotomy groups, there was no difference in the RFA values but significant higher ET values in mixed/cortical bone samples in favor for the piezosurgery group.\nPiezosurgery and conventional implant bed drilling procedure do have similar mechanical outcomes regarding primary stability with high RFA values, but the preparation does need more time for piezosurgery group, so that piezosurgery might be a valuable tool in only very specific cases for implant bed preparation.", "journal": "Clinical oral implants research", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["KeyvanSagheb", "Vinay VKumar", "AdrianoAzaripour", "ChristianWalter", "BilalAl-Nawas", "Peer WK\u00e4mmerer"], "doi": "10.1111/clr.12783"}
{"title": "Accuracy of piezoelectric pedometer and accelerometer step counts.", "abstract": "This study aimed to assess step-count accuracy of a piezoeletric pedometer (Yamax PW/EX-510), when worn at different body parts, and a triaxial accelerometer (GT3X+), and to compare device accuracy; and identify the preferred location(s) to wear a pedometer.\nSixty-three healthy adults (45.8\u00b120.6 years old) wore 7 pedometers (neck, lateral right and left of the waist, front right and left of the waist, front pockets of the trousers) and 1 accelerometer (over the right hip), while walking 120 m at slow, self-preferred/normal and fast paces. Steps were recorded. Participants identified their preferred location(s) to wear the pedometer. Absolute percent error (APE) and Bland and Altman (BA) method were used to assess device accuracy (criterion measure: manual counts) and BA method for device comparisons.\nPedometer APE was below 3% at normal and fast paces despite wearing location, but higher at slow pace (4.5-9.1%). Pedometers were more accurate at the front waist and inside the pockets. Accelerometer APE was higher than pedometer APE (P<0.05); nevertheless, limits of agreement between devices were relatively small. Preferred wearing locations were inside the front right (N.=25) and left (N.=20) pockets of the trousers.\nYamax PW/EX-510 pedometers may be preferable than GT3X+ accelerometers to count steps, as they provide more accurate results. These pedometers should be worn at the front right or left positions of the waist or inside the front pockets of the trousers.", "journal": "The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness", "date": "2016-01-23", "authors": ["JoanaCruz", "DinaBrooks", "AldaMarques"], "doi": "10.23736/S0022-4707.16.06177-X"}
{"title": "Home monitoring of heart failure patients at risk for hospital readmission using a novel under-the-mattress piezoelectric sensor: A preliminary single centre experience.", "abstract": "Introduction A piezoelectric sensor (PS) converts mechanical deformations into electrical signals. We used a contactless under-the-mattress PS to monitor physiological vibrations resulting from breathing, pumping of the heart, and body movements, among individuals at home following hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Our objectives were to assess acceptability of the device in the home, to assess physiological patterns, and to determine if altered patterns correlate with readmission. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study of 30 patients discharged home following HF hospitalization. PS data included a continuous nightly assessment of heart rate, respiration rate, movement rate, rapid and shallow respiration duration, and a behaviour score. We utilized random forest classification to classify average nightly data by readmission status. Results We collected 640 nights of PS data from 29 patients. There were nine readmissions, of which four were for HF. PS monitoring was tolerated by all but one of the participants. We inspected continuous nightly physiological profiles and noted differences between patients who were and were not readmitted. Patients readmitted for HF had higher average heart and respiration rates, and more respiration variability. Average nightly respiratory rate was most predictive of readmission. Discussion We are the first to study nocturnal physiological patterns of HF patients at home using a contactless under-the-mattress monitoring system. We noted patterns that may be unique to patients at risk for readmission due to HF. Respiratory rate was the most important risk-adjusted associate of readmission for HF. Further studies should investigate the efficacy of home PS monitoring in HF populations.", "journal": "Journal of telemedicine and telecare", "date": "2015-12-17", "authors": ["Mosi KBennett", "MingyuanShao", "Eiran ZGorodeski"], "doi": "10.1177/1357633X15618810"}
{"title": "Tyrosinase immobilized on a hydrophobic membrane.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane surfaces were ad hoc functionalized chemically to make them suitable for enzymatic immobilization. The process was performed by grafting the membrane surface with 1,4-diaminobutane and subsequently by activating it with glutarhaldehyde. The chemico-physical properties of the original PVDF membrane and of the modified membranes were studied by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and static contact angle measurements. The activated membranes were used as a support for covalent immobilization of tyrosinase. The activity of free and immobilized enzyme was studied and compared. The experimental data showing the specific activity of the immobilized enzyme are similar to the value obtained with the free one. This means that the immobilization procedure did not alter the catalytic properties of the tyrosinase. In addition, the surface modification of the PVDF made it a promising material to use in enzyme or biomolecule immobilization processes.", "journal": "Biotechnology and applied biochemistry", "date": "2015-11-27", "authors": ["CatiaAlgieri", "LauraDonato", "LidiettaGiorno"], "doi": "10.1002/bab.1462"}
