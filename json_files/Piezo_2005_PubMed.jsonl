In this method, a sufficiently negative potential was applied to the electrode surface to generate hydroxyl ions, which play the role of the catalyst for the hydrolysis and condensation of 3-(aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS). The process of the preparation of the imprinted sol-gel film was investigated in detail by using the piezoelectric quartz crystal impedance (PQCI) technique and cyclic voltammetry. The thickness of the imprinted film was controlled easily by adjusting the applied potential and the deposited time. The binding capacity and the selectivity of the electrodeposited imprinted sol-gel film were also studied in detail by using PQCI, electrochemically impedance technique and capacitance technique. The electrodeposited imprinted sol-gel film exhibited high selectivity toward cytidine in comparison to interfering substances. The dissociation constant (K(d)) in the nanomolar range indicated a strong imprinted interaction existing between the electrodeposited sol-gel-imprinted film and the template cytidine.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2008-10-31", "authors": ["ZhaohuiZhang", "LihuaNie", "ShouzhuoYao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.talanta.2005.10.008"}

The biosensor is specific for the detection of the mecA gene of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is responsible of several infections in humans, like pneumonia, meningitis and endocarditic. MRSA is also a major cause of hospital-acquired infections worldwide. The antibiotics resistance is conferred by the gene mecA, codifying for an anomalous protein. Two different immobilisation procedures of the probe specific for mecA gene are reported: immobilisation via streptavidin-biotin interaction and direct immobilisation of thiolated probes. After the study with synthetic oligonucleotides, the system has been applied to the analysis of bacterial DNA from MRSA, amplified by polymerase chain reaction. These samples were pre-treated with two different denaturation procedures and the performances of the sensor in the two cases were compared. The two immobilisation methods and denaturation protocols were here used to study the influences of these parameters on the performances of the sensor, applied here to the detection of the mecA gene.

{"title": "Biomimetic properties and surface studies of a piezoelectric caffeine sensor based on electrosynthesized polypyrrole.", "abstract": "An approach for preparing a chemical sensor for caffeine through the combination of molecularly imprinted polypyrrole and a piezoelectric quartz transducer was proposed. The caffeine-imprinted polymer was synthesized using galvanostatic electropolymerization of pyrrole monomer directly onto one of the gold electrodes of a 9MHz AT-cut quartz crystal in the presence of caffeine. The optimum conditions for the electrosynthesis of the reagent phase were established. Caffeine molecules were entrapped in the matrix of polymer film, and were removed by subsequent washing with water, leaving behind pores capable of recognizing the target analyte molecule. The caffeine sensor was fixed in a measuring cell and measurement of the resonant frequency of the quartz crystal as it comes in contact with the caffeine solution was carried out in a stopped flow mode. A steady-state response was achieved in about 10min. The sensor exhibited a linear relationship between the frequency shift and the ln of caffeine concentration in the range of 0.1-10mg/mL (correlation coefficient, r=0.9882). The sensitivity of the sensor was about 255Hz/ln concentration (mg/mL). A good repeatability, R.S.D.=9 (n=6) for 0.5mg/mL caffeine solution was also observed. The use of the sensor can present a potential low-cost option for determining caffeine. Surface analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on the polymer coating in order to elucidate the imprinting process and rebinding of caffeine to the polymer matrix during the sensing process.

For both binding reactions benzoylecgonine-1,8-diamino-3,4-dioxaoctane (BZE-DADOO) was immobilized on the surface of the sensor. For immobilization, pre-conjugated BZE-DADOO with 11-mercaptomonoundecanoic acid (MUA) via 2-(5-norbornen-2,3-dicarboximide)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate (TNTU) allowed the formation of a chemisorbed monolayer on the piezosensor surface. The detection of cocaine was based on a competitive assay. The change of frequency measured after 300s of the binding reaction was used as the signal. The maximum binding of the antibody resulted in a frequency decrease of 35Hz (with an imprecision 3%, n = 3) while the presence of 100pmoll(-1) cocaine decreased the binding by 11%. The limit of detection was consequently below 100pmoll(-1) for cocaine. The total time of one analysis was 15min. This BZE-DADOO-modified sensor was adapted for the detection of organophosphates.

{"title": "Improved analysis of membrane protein by PVDF-aided, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.", "abstract": "Characterization of membrane proteins remains an analytical challenge because of difficulties associated with tedious isolation and purification. This study presents the utility of the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for direct sub-proteome profiling and membrane protein characterization by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The hydrophobic adsorption of protein, particularly membrane proteins, on the PVDF surface enables efficient on-PVDF washing to remove high concentrations of detergents and salts, such as up to 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The enhanced spectrum quality for MALDI detection is particularly notable for high molecular weight proteins. By using on-PVDF washing prior to MALDI detection, we obtained protein profiles of the detergent-containing and detergent-insoluble membrane fractions from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Similar improvements of signal-to-noise ratios were shown on the MALDI spectra for proteins electroblotted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) onto the PVDF membrane. We have applied this strategy to obtain intact molecular weights of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) composed of three intrinsic membrane-bound proteins, PmoA, PmoB, and PmoC. Together with peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry, post-translational modifications including N-terminal acetylation of PmoA and PmoC and alternative C-terminal truncation of PmoB were identified.

It is also known that arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measure of the elasticity or stiffness of peripheral arterial blood vessels. However, it generally requires complex instrumentations to have an accurate measurement and not suited for continual monitoring. In this paper, it describes a simple and non-intrusive method to detect the cardiovascular pulse from a human wrist above the radial artery and a fingertip. The main components of this proposed method are a piezoelectric transducer and a photoplethysmography circuitry. 5 healthy adults (4 male) with age ranging from 25 to 38 years were recruited. The timing consistency of the detected pulsations is first evaluated and compared to that obtained from a commercial electrocardiogram. Furthermore, the derived PWV is then assessed by the predicted values attained from regression equations of two previous similar studies. The results show good correlations (p<0.05) and similarities for the former and latter respectively.

TGA and FTIR analyses confirmed that the solvent, N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC), used for mixing PVdF(HFP) polymer with ionic liquid was almost totally removed during the gelling and drying processes. SEM photographs were taken of the surface structure of the PVdF(HFP)-ionic liquid gel in order to evaluate the morphology of the film's surface according to the mixing ratio and the nature of the ionic liquid. The thermal behaviors of PVdF(HFP)-ionic liquid gels were observed to be similar to those of neat ionic liquids through DSC analysis, and the compatibility between the polymer and ionic liquid was investigated by XRD analysis.

Water permeation was observed in PVDF microporous membranes after PVA adsorption, and maximum permeability was obtained after treatment with 4% PVA solution. Water permeability increased linearly with increasing PVA concentration up to 4%, and then a marginal decrease with a further increase in PVA concentration occurred. PVA adsorbed PVDF membranes were subjected to intense physicochemical analysis, especially with XPS. XPS results display the presence of an interface between PVA and PVDF, and the binding energy (BE) of the interface is low for the PVDF membranes treated with 4% PVA. Carbon from CF2-groups and F 1s core level clearly showed a decrease in its content on the surface after PVA adsorption and showed a minimum fluorine content at 4% PVA. F 1s BE shifts by 0.5 eV upon PVA adsorption and is independent of PVA concentration. EDAX analysis indicates that the bulk oxygen content remains within 4.5 +/- 0.6% and is independent of the PVA concentration. Nonetheless, a large amount of surface atom percentage of oxygen (20 +/- 4%) from O 1s core level shows an increase in PVA content on the surface of PVDF, and it is restricted mostly to the surface. The 4% PVA treated PVDF membrane clearly shows a broadening of O 1s core level to lower BE and indicates the interaction between PVDF and PVA which is significantly different compared to any other compositions. A new valence band feature at low BE, which is nonexistent on PVDF, develops after PVA adsorption. This indicates that the shift in the nature of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) derived mostly from oxygen; simultaneously, a suppression in the PVDF derived band indicates the change in nature of the PVA adsorbed surfaces from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The above observations also suggest an irreversible electronic interaction between PVA and PVDF, possibly through charge transfer.", "journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Two potential-sweep ranges, -0.4 to 0.9 (I) and 0 to 0.9 (II) V versus SCE, and four solutions, acidic (A, 0.20 mol/L H2SO4 + 0.10 mol/L Na2SO4; B, 0.10 mol/L H2SO4 + 0.20 mol/L Na2SO4), neutral (C, 0.10 mol/L PBS + 0.20 mol/L Na2SO4, pH 7.2), and alkaline (D, 0.20 mol/L NaOH + 0.20 mol/L Na2SO4) aqueous solutions, were selected for PoPD growth. The pH increase for the polymerization solution increased the molar percentage of polyaniline-like chains in PoPD, as quantified from the current peaks at approximately 0.6 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for the oxidation of -NH2 groups in as-prepared PoPD (grown from solutions C and D) during their redox switching in 0.10 mol/L aqueous H2SO4 for the first time. The unusual PQCI responses observed at negative potentials (potential range I) in the first several potential cycles during the cyclic voltammetric growth of PoPD in acidic and neutral solutions have been reasonably explained as being due to the precipitation/dissolution of the poorly soluble phenazinehydrine charge-transfer complexes developed during redox switching of oligomers for the first time, which brought about much less compact PoPD films and their higher degradability than those grown in the same solution but over potential range II. SECM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) frequency were used to estimate the sizes of etched microscale spots.

Using a galactose-decorated surface, we have developed a method to combine these two approaches by co-culturing rat primary hepatocyte spheroids with NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Spheroids were performed by culturing hepatocytes for 3 days on galactosylated poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane; NIH/3T3 cells were subsequently seeded and co-cultured with the spheroids. Results showed that although NIH/3T3 cells alone responded poorly to the galactosylated PVDF surface and displayed limited attachment, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts attached to the periphery of the hepatocyte spheroids and proliferated around them. Co-cultured hepatocyte spheroids exhibited significantly higher liver-specific functions as compared to spheroids cultured alone. Albumin secretion level in this co-culture system peaked on day 11, which was 1.8- and 2.9-times higher than the peak expression level in spheroid homo-culture control in serum-free (day 3) and serum-containing media (day 4), respectively. The albumin secretion function was maintained for at least two weeks; it was 5.1 (in serum-free medium) and 17.8 (in serum-containing medium) times higher than spheroid homo-culture on day 13.

The heart of this device, and what makes it unique is the pyro-electric detector, which measures radiation by converting heat from absorbed incident X-rays into an electric current. This current is then converted to a voltage and digitised. The detector consists of a ferro-electric crystal; two types were tested: lithium tantalate and lithium niobate. X-ray measurement in mammography is challenging because of its relatively low photon energy range, from 11 keV to 15 keV equivalent mean energy, corresponding to a peak tube potential from 22 to 36 kV. Consequently, energy fluence rate or intensity is low compared with that of common diagnostic X-ray. The instrument is capable of measuring intensities as low as 0.25 mW m(-2) with precision greater than 99%.

The system consisted of eight polyvinylidene fluoride cable sensors, charge amplifiers and measuring software, together with an analogue-to-digital converter unit. The cable sensors were horizontally embedded into a textile sheet on a bed surface covering the upper half of the body. The digital infinite impulse response filters were constructed to extract cardiorespiratory signals from displacement of the sensors. The system software automatically searched the optimum sensor(s) based on the power of the respective filter outputs. Then, the system obtained the 5 s average HR and 15 s average RR by measuring the intervals between the peaks of the respective autocorrelation functions of the filtered output. If the subject changed his posture, the system captured the image of the body position as a time stamp using a CCD camera. To show the validity of this method, the HR and RR obtained by this monitor were compared with those simultaneously measured using respiratory flow and an electrocardiogram. The results showed that the mean frame-by-frame difference ranged from -1.2 to 0.2 beats min(-1) for the HR and, for RR, ranged from -0.8 to 1.4 breath min(-1) during the short-term recordings. Similar differences were obtained during the first 2 h of overnight recordings.

For ultrasound-radiating applications, thicker PZT films are preferred because generative force and response speed of the diaphragm-type transducers increase with increasing film thickness. However, integration of 4- to 20-microm thick PZT films on silicon wafer, either the deposition or the patterning, is still a bottleneck in the micromachining process. This paper reports on a diaphragm-type pMUT. A composite coating technique based on chemical solution deposition and high-energy ball milled powder has been used to fabricate thick PZT films. Micromachining of the pMUTs using such thick films has been investigated. The fabricated pMUT with crack-free PZT films up to 7-microm thick was evaluated as an ultrasonic transmitter. The generated sound pressure level of up to 120 dB indicates that the fabricated pMUT has very good ultrasound-radiating performance and, therefore, can be used to compose pMUT arrays for generating ultrasound beam with high directivity in numerous applications.

{"title": "A review of technologies for rapid detection of bacteria in recreational waters.", "abstract": "Monitoring of recreational beaches for fecal indicator bacteria is currently performed using culture-based technology that can require more than a day for laboratory analysis, during which time swimmers are at risk. Here we review new methods that have the potential to reduce the measurement period to less than an hour. These methods generally involve two steps. The first is target capture, in which the microbial group of interest (or some molecular/chemical/or biochemical signature of the group) is removed, tagged or amplified to differentiate it from the remaining material in the sample. We discuss three classes of capture methods: 1) Surface and whole-cell recognition methods, including immunoassay techniques and molecule-specific probes; 2) Nucleic acid methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) and microarrays; and 3) Enzyme/substrate methods utilizing chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates. The second step is detection, in which optical, electrochemical or piezoelectric technologies are used to quantify the captured, tagged or amplified material. The biggest technological hurdle for all of these methods is sensitivity, as EPA's recommended bathing water standard is less than one cell per ml and most detection technologies measure sample volumes less than 1 ml. This challenge is being overcome through addition of preconcentration or enrichment steps, which have the potential to boost sensitivity without the need to develop new detector technology. The second hurdle is demonstrating a relationship to health risk, since most new methods are based on measuring cell structure without assessing viability and may not relate to current water quality standards that were developed in epidemiology studies using culture-based methods. Enzyme/substrate methods may be the first rapid methods adopted because they are based on the same capture technology as currently-approved EPA methods and their relationship to health risk can be established by demonstrating equivalency to existing procedures. Demonstration of equivalency may also be possible for some surface and whole-cell recognition methods that capture bacteria in a potentially viable state. Nucleic acid technologies are the most versatile, but measure nonviable structure and will require inclusion in epidemiological studies to link their measurement with health risk.", "journal": "Journal of water and health", "date": "2006-02-08", "authors": ["Rachel TNoble", "Stephen BWeisberg"], "doi": "10.2166/wh.2005.051"}

{"title": "The determination of the optimal length of crystal blanks in quartz crystal resonators.", "abstract": "It is well understood that the strong coupling of thickness-shear and flexural vibrations in piezoelectric crystal plates only occurs at specific length at which the vibration mode conversion, like the flexural mode gradually converting to thickness-shear mode while the thickness-shear mode converting to higher-order flexural mode, happens. It is important to avoid the strong coupling of modes in a crystal resonator that uses thickness-shear vibrations to enhance the energy trapping. To achieve such a design goal, the length of a crystal blank should be carefully chosen such that the coupling is at its weakest, which usually is in the middle of two strong coupling points. Through a closer examination of the frequency spectra, or the frequency-length relationship in this study, we can see that the strong coupling points appear periodically. This implies that we can find exact locations with the plate theory that predicts the resonance frequency. Based on this observation, we first use the first-order Mindlin plate theory with the precise thickness-shear frequency, which is normalized to one, to find corresponding wavenumbers. Then the length as a variable is solved from the coupled frequency equation for exact coupling points in a crystal plate of AT-cut quartz. The optimal length of a crystal blank in the simplest resonator model is calculated for the coupled thickness-shear, flexural, and extensional vibrations.

Galactosylated Pluronic polymer is immobilized on poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) hollow fiber surface through an adsorption scheme yielding a substrate with hepatocyte-specific ligand and a hydrophilic surface layer, which can resist nonspecific protein adsorption and facilitate cell binding to the galactose ligand. Interestingly, the galactosylated PVDF hollow fiber shows enhanced serum albumin diffusion across the membrane. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were seeded and cultured in the extralumenal space of the hollow fiber cartridge for 18 days in a continuously circulated system. Albumin secretion function of the seeded hepatocytes was monitored by analyzing circulating medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Urea synthesis and P-450 function (7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylase activity) were measured periodically by doping the circulating medium with NH4Cl and 7-ethoxycoumarin, respectively. Hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PVDF hollow fibers maintained better albumin secretion and P-450 functions than on unmodified and serum-coated PVDF hollow fibers when cultured in serum-containing medium. Morphological examination by scanning electron microscopy showed that hepatocytes cultured on galactosylated PVDF hollow fibers developed significant aggregation, in contrast to those cultured on unmodified PVDF fibers or on serum-coated PVDF fibers.

Wounds were irradiated with low-energy, 550-nm, nanosecond pulsed light, and photoacoustic signals induced were measured with a piezoelectric film as a function of postburn time. Measurement in normal skin as a control was also performed. Temporal profiles of the photoacoustic signals were converted into depth profiles using sound velocity of tissue, and for each profile, a peak showing highest signal intensity was selected. For this peak, the depth at which the signal rose (signal rise depth) and the depth that gave a peak value (signal peak depth) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to clarify the difference in depth information of signals between burn groups.\nDepth profiles of photoacoustic signals showed unique features depending on the degree of burn; pronounced peaks shifted to deeper tissue as the burn severity increased. This indicates that the zone of stasis formed due to injuries can be monitored. There were significant differences in both the signal rise depth and the peak depth between the control and SDB groups, SDB and DDB groups, and DDB and DB groups (p < 0.001).\nSDBs, DDBs, and DBs can be differentiated by photoacoustic signals, suggesting that the method proposed is useful for diagnosing burn injuries.", "journal": "The Journal of trauma", "date": "2006-01-06", "authors": ["ShunichiSato", "MutsuoYamazaki", "DaizohSaitoh", "HitoshiTsuda", "YoshiakiOkada", "MinoruObara", "HiroshiAshida"], "doi": "10.1097/01.ta.0000197389.94466.04"}

This allows us to resolve the shear mechanical Johari-Goldstein beta peak in the equilibrium DHIQ liquid. We moreover report a signature (a pronounced rise in the shear mechanical loss at frequencies above the alpha relaxation) of a Johari-Goldstein beta relaxation in the shear mechanical spectra for all the liquids which show a beta relaxation in the dielectric spectrum. It is found that both the alpha and beta loss peaks are shifted to higher frequencies in the shear mechanical spectrum compared to the dielectric spectrum. It is in both the shear and dielectric responses found that liquids obeying time-temperature superposition also have a high-frequency power law with exponent close to -12.

{"title": "Liquid heating effects by SAW streaming on the piezoelectric substrate.", "abstract": "When a liquid is placed on a surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation surface, a longitudinal wave is radiated into the liquid, and the liquid begins to vibrate stream, jet, and atomize. This phenomenon is known as SAW streaming. In this paper, we describe experimental results concerning the temperature of a thin liquid layer during SAW generation. The results reveal that the temperature of the liquid is a function of the SAW amplitude, which is determined by the applied voltage. This means that the liquid temperature can be controlled by the applied voltage. We conclude that a novel microliquid heating system can be realized using the SAW device.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2005-12-31", "authors": ["JunKondoh", "NorifumiShimizu", "YoshikazuMatsui", "ShowkoShiokawa"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2005.1561646"}

The model of infinite IDT is extended to deal with the finite IDT with edge discontinuities. The effect of electromechanical actuation on the wavelength shifts with respect to the passive case is investigated. The problem of electrically driven instability within the IDT is analyzed. Numerical results are reported by considering a model of the IDT integrated with the host structure, which shows that there are significant deviations from the conventional design estimates while launching a targeted mode.

This paper presents the design and theoretical analysis of a PZT-based micro acoustic sensor that uses interdigital electrodes (IDE) and in-plane polarization (IPP) instead of commonly used parallel plate-electrodes (PPE) and through-thickness polarization (TTP). The sensitivity of IDE-based sensors is increased due to the small capacitance of the interdigital capacitor and the large and adjustable electrode spacing. In addition, the sensitivity takes advantage of a large piezoelectric coefficient d33 rather than d31, which is used in PPE-based sensors, resulting in a further improvement in the sensitivity. Laminated beam theory is used to analyze the laminated piezoelectric sensors, and the capacitance of the IDE is deduced by using conformal mapping and partial capacitance techniques. Analytical formulations for predicting the sensitivity of both PPE- and IDE-based microsensors are presented, and factors that influence sensitivity are discussed in detail. Results show that the IDE and IPP can improve the sensitivity significantly.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2005-12-31", "authors": ["ZheyaoWang", "ChaoWang", "LitianLiu"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2005.1561640"}

Equivalent-circuit models, which are traditionally used to analyze piezoelectric transformers, merge each mechanical resonance effect into a series of ordinary differential equations. Because of using ordinary differential equations, equivalent circuit models are insufficient to reflect the mechanical behavior of piezoelectric plates. Electromechanically, fully coupled governing equations of Rosen-type piezoelectric transformers, which are partial differential equations in nature, can be derived to address the deficiencies of the equivalent circuit models. It can be shown that the modal actuator concept can be adopted to optimize the electromechanical coupling effect of the driving section once the added spatial domain design parameters are taken into account, which are three-dimensional spatial dependencies of electromechanical properties. The maximum power transfer condition for a Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer is detailed.

High capacitances of the transducers are desired in order to match the electrical impedance between the transducers and the coaxial cable in array probes. Although piezoelectric ceramics that have high dielectric constants (epsilon33t/epsilon0 > 5000, k'33 < 70%) are produced in many foundries, the dielectric constants are insufficient. However, we have reported that low molecular mass B-site ions in the lead-perovskite structures are important in realizing better dielectric and piezoelectric properties. We focused on the complex system ceramics PSMNZT that consists of light B-site elements.

{"title": "Growth of A1N piezoelectric film on diamond for high-frequency surface acoustic wave devices.", "abstract": "Diamond films are very desirable for application to SAW devices because of their high acoustic wave velocity, which allows the extending of the frequency limit of operation at a given interdigital transducer line-width resolution. Use of high-quality AIN as the piezoelectric layer in conjunction with diamond is also desirable because of its high SAW velocity--the highest among all piezoelectric materials--together with its excellent electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties. The problems arising in the growth of A1N films on diamond have prevented, until now, the use of this combination of materials. In this paper we present recent results on the growth of highly oriented, low-stressed A1N films on diamond. SAW propagation on A1N/diamond has been theoretically investigated together with electromechanical coupling for both the Rayleigh and the Sezawa modes. The theoretical calculations show that high SAW velocities are achievable with good coupling efficiencies. Under proper conditions very large piezoelectric couplings are predicted--k2 = 2.2 and 4% for the Rayleigh and the Sezawa wave, respectively--comparable to those observed in strongly piezoelectric single crystals such as LiNbO3, but with SAW velocities approximately two-fold higher.

{"title": "Effect of intraluminal thrombus on pressure transmission in the abdominal aortic aneurysm.", "abstract": "To clarify the effect of intraluminal thrombus on pressure transmission.\nA saccular aneurysm was inserted into an artificial circulation system. Subsequently, the saccular aneurysm was filled with eight different human aortic aneurysm thrombus samples. Starch solution in an empty aneurysm was used as a control. A pressure sensor measured the pressure in the circulation, and a second piezoelectric sensor measured the pressure in the saccular aneurysm at 3, 2, and 1 cm from the endoluminal surface (23 locations). The influence of the elastic characteristics of the aneurysm wall on the extent of pressure reduction was evaluated by experiments performed with aneurysms made of rubber and paraffin.\nThe pressures measured in the empty aneurysm were identical to those measured in circulation (P > .05). The pressure measured in the thrombus was significantly lower than the pressure measured in the circulation (P < .05). The mean pressure ratio between the systolic thrombus pressure and systolic circulation pressure at 1, 2, and 3 cm was 0.90 +/- 0.09, 0.86 +/- 0.10, and 0.81 +/- 0.09, respectively. However, there was a clear correlation between the pressure in the circulation and in the thrombus (Pearson correlation coefficient: mean, r = 0.997; range, 0.975-0.999; P < .01). The change in circulatory pressure was followed by an almost identical change in thrombus pressure (regression coefficient: mean, beta = .997; range, .983-1.000; P < .01). In stiff aneurysms, the pressure reduction is less than in more compliant ones (P < .05).\nIn an in vitro model, pressure in the aneurysmal sac is reduced by fibrinous thrombus.\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) aims at reducing the pressure in the aneurysmal sac. Therefore, it seems attractive to use pressure monitoring in the aneurysmal sac as a follow-up after EVAR. This study contributes to the development of the rationale of pressure monitoring in the aneurysmal sac as a follow-up method after EVAR. The aneurysmal sac is filled with thrombus. To interpret pressure measurements in the thrombus, we have to learn about the effect of the thrombus on pressure transmission and on the pressure measurements themselves.

Sperm membrane damage caused by different immobilization methods by rubbing with a micropipette without piezo pulses (R), or with a low (L) or high (H) intensity of piezo pulses while rubbing, was assessed by the time required for staining of sperm heads with eosin Y solution. The average time for staining of sperm heads immobilized by the R, L or H treatments was 76, 41 or 26 s, respectively. The fertilization rate following ICSI was increased by sperm immobilization by piezo pulses compared with R, but increased intensity of pulses from L to H did not cause further improvements (29, 48 and 47%, respectively). An immunofluorescence study revealed that H immobilization promoted the dissociation of SAR-PT from sperm chromatin compared with L and R, and it increased the frequency of male pronuclear formation in which chromatin appeared uniformly decondensed. With in vitro fertilization (IVF), SAR-PT disassembled coordinately with sperm chromatin decondensation and it was not detectable around male pronuclei. This was different from most of the oocytes after ICSI in which remnants SAR-PT were detected adjacent to male pronuclei. We concluded that increased damage on the sperm plasma membrane at immobilization improved fertilization rates and decondensation of sperm chromatin after ICSI due to the accelerated dissociation of SAR-PT from the sperm nucleus. Also, the behavior of SAR-PT after ICSI was different from that observed in oocytes after IVF.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2005-12-03", "authors": ["MikaKatayama", "PeterSutovsky", "Boh SYang", "TomCantley", "AugustRieke", "RandyFarwell", "RichardOko", "Billy NDay"], "doi": "10.1530/rep.1.0680"}

A gold-coated millimeter-sized rectangular-shaped lead zirconate titanate (PZT) cantilever of dimensions 3.5 x 2 x 0.05 mm, previously shown to detect a picogram level of mass change, was used to measure the adsorption kinetics of 1-hexadecanethiol in ethanol over six orders of concentration range (1 nM to 10 mM) in real time. The flexural mode of cantilever vibration, 45.5 +/- 0.01 kHz, was monitored during the self-assembly. The total resonant frequency change obtained for the 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 microM, 4 mM, 8 mM, and 10 mM thiol concentrations were 116 +/- 2 (n = 2), 225 (n = 1), 270 +/- 10 (n = 2), 440 +/- 10 (n = 2), 900 +/- 10 (n = 2), 900 +/- 10 (n = 2), and 900 +/- 10 (n = 2) Hz, respectively. These results compare favorably to literature results in that the rate of the monolayer formation is concentration-dependent and the exponential change during adsorption follows the reversible first-order Langmuir kinetic model. The rate constants of adsorption and desorption were 0.061 M(-1) s(-1) and 3.61 x 10(-4) s(-1), respectively. The significance of the results is that millimeter-sized PZT cantilevers can be used in real-time for characterizing self-assembly of monolayer formation at nanomolar concentration levels.

{"title": "Comparison of sound fields generated by different coded excitations--experimental results.", "abstract": "This work reports the results of measurements of spatial distributions of ultrasound fields obtained from five energizing schemes. Three different codes, namely, chirp signal and two sinusoidal sequences were investigated. The sequences were phase modulated with 13 bits Barker code and 16 bits Golay complementary codes. Moreover, two reference signals generated as two and sixteen cycle sine tone bursts were examined. Planar, 50% (fractional) bandwidth, 15 mm diameter source transducer operating at 2 MHz center frequency was used in all measurements. The experimental data were collected using computerized scanning system and recorded using wideband, PVDF membrane hydrophone (Sonora 804). The measured echoes were compressed, so the complete pressure field in the investigated location before and after compression could be compared. In addition to a priori anticipated increase in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the decoded pressure fields, the results indicated differences in the pressure amplitude levels, directivity patterns, and the axial distance at which the maximum pressure amplitude was recorded. It was found that the directivity patterns of non-compressed fields exhibited shapes similar to the patterns characteristic for sinusoidal excitation having relatively long time duration. In contrast, the patterns corresponding to compressed fields resembled those produced by brief, wideband pulses. This was particularly visible in the case of binary sequences. The location of the maximum pressure amplitude measured in the 2 MHz field shifted towards the source by 15 mm and 25 mm for Barker code and Golay code, respectively. The results of this work may be applicable in the development of new coded excitation schemes. They could also be helpful in optimizing the design of imaging transducers employed in ultrasound systems designed for coded excitation. Finally, they could shed additional light on the relationship between the spatial field distribution and achievable image quality and in this way facilitate optimization of the images obtained using coded systems.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2005-11-30", "authors": ["ANowicki", "ZKlimonda", "MLewandowski", "JLitniewski", "P ALewin", "ITrots"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2005.10.001"}

Yet the extent to which gender related differences in cardiac performance are due to the presence of sex-specific biological factors are unclear. We used a longitudinal study aimed at examining whether castration and androgen replacement affects cardiac performance in conscious adult male rats. Adult male rats were implanted with Piezoelectric transit-time gauges and radio telemetry devices to measure regional myocardial segment length and hemodynamic variables before and after castration and after androgen replacement. Androgen withdrawal accelerated average heart rates by 7% (p=0.010). Heart rate was lowered to intact values when androgens were restored to normal physiological levels (p=0.004). Mean arterial pressure was not affected by androgen deprivation and androgen replacement. However, androgen withdrawal produced a 40% decrease in the velocity of circumferential shortening and a 46% reduction in the rate of myocardial relaxation. Androgen supplementation completely restored contractile function. These results provide the first evidence that androgen withdrawal and androgen replacement produces dramatic alterations on cardiac performance in conscious animals and demonstrates the significance of androgens as a cardio-regulatory hormone in males.

That way, the pressure is integrated along one or two dimensions, enabling the use of numerically efficient algorithms, such as algorithms for the inverse radon transformation, for thermoacoustic tomography.

For the applications, the maximum voltage is used to elucidate how to cause an electrical shock for users of the PT under open-circuit operation. The DC time constant and the AC time constant are used to estimate the equivalent resistance of the mechanical loss and the dielectric resistance of the dielectric loss, respectively. Also, the AC time constant is used to estimate the quality factor of the PT. Additionally, the oscillation frequency is used as an antiresonant frequency of the PT. In order to verify the above characteristics and applications, both an equivalent circuit with initial conditions and a drive system with a control switch interposed between the PT and its AC voltage source are adopted to derive the transient response and measure its characteristics.

The SW error scores were significantly correlated with the absolute pedometer tilt angle at all walking speeds (P < 0.05), but the NL error scores were not. On average the NL recorded 1030 +/- 1414 (16.5 +/- 22.7%) more steps that the SW during the 24-h trial.\nIn overweight and obese individuals, a piezo-electric pedometer (NL) is more accurate than a spring-levered pedometer (SW), especially at slower walking speeds. In addition, it appears that pedometer tilt; more so than waist circumference and BMI, was the most important factor influencing the accuracy of the SW.

This paper provides a critical review of current sensory systems and the potential of a selection of electroactive polymers for sensory applications in hand prostheses. Candidate electroactive polymers are reviewed in terms of their relevant advantages and disadvantages, together with their current implementation in related applications. Empirical analysis of one of the most novel electroactive polymers, ionic polymer metal composites (IPMC), was conducted to demonstrate its potential for prosthetic applications. With linear responses within the operating range typical of hand prostheses, bending angles, and bending rates were accurately measured with 4.4+/-2.5 and 4.8+/-3.5% error, respectively, using the IPMC sensors. With these comparable error rates to traditional resistive bend sensors and a wide range of sensitivities and responses, electroactive polymers offer a promising alternative to more traditional sensory approaches. Their potential role in prosthetics is further heightened by their flexible and formable structure, and their ability to act as both sensors and actuators.", "journal": "Medical engineering & physics", "date": "2005-11-02", "authors": ["ElaineBiddiss", "TomChau"], "doi": "10.1016/j.medengphy.2005.09.009"}

The mechanism of nano-acoustic wave (NAW) generation in strained piezoelectric layers, induced by femtosecond optical pulses, can be modeled by a macroscopic elastic continuum theory. The optical absorption change of the strained layers modulated by NAW through quantum-confined Franz-Keldysh (QCFK) effects allows optical detection of the propagating NAW. Based on these piezoelectric-based optical principles, we have designed an optical piezoelectric transducer (OPT) to generate NAW. The optically generated NAW is then applied to one-dimensional (1-D) ultrasonic scan for thickness measurement, which is the first step toward multidimensional nano-ultrasonic imaging. By launching a NAW pulse and resolving the returned acoustic echo signal with femtosecond optical pulses, the thickness of the studied layer can be measured with <1 nm resolution.

Through the use of computational analysis in the actuator's design, the vibration characteristics were improved in order to obtain a better actuator. The generation of a radial traveling wave about the circumference of the actuator, akin to a ring, is shown to exist despite the unusual shape, and the presence of traveling wave motion along the output face also is shown to exist. By using short-time sinusoidal signals, slider displacements as small as 82 nm were obtained from the actuator, and by using direct current (DC) input, displacements of up to +/-107 nm were obtained, suggesting a way to obtain subnanometer positioning accuracy over arbitrary sliding distances. By reversing the phase between the paired driving signals, the direction of motion was reversed at up to 300 Hz; the slider displacement and velocity was found to be inversely proportional to the phase-reversal rate, and the slider's peak velocity and maximum thrust force were directly proportional to the phase between the driving signals. The output force and velocity of the actuator was fairly insensitive to the input frequency, giving measurable motion between 132.5 and 141.5 kHz, but was sensitive to the input voltage, requiring at least 38 V input for operation, and was approximately quadratically dependent on the applied preload centered about 2.25 N.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2005-10-26", "authors": ["JamesFriend", "KentaroNakamura", "SadayukiUeha"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2005.1509792"}

Following determination of isokinetic peak torque (PT) and the isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), 10 adults (mean+/-SD age=22.8+/-2.7yrs) performed randomly ordered, submaximal step muscle actions of the dominant forearm flexors in 20% increments from 20% to 80% PT and MVC. Surface MMG signals were recorded simultaneously from a contact sensor and an accelerometer placed over the belly of the biceps brachii muscle. During the isokinetic and isometric muscle actions, the contact sensor and accelerometer resulted in linear increases in normalized MMG amplitude with torque (r(2) range=0.84-0.97) but the linear slope of the normalized MMG amplitude versus isokinetic torque relationship for the accelerometer was less (p<0.10) than that of the contact sensor. There was no significant (p>0.05) relationship for normalized MMG mean power frequency (MPF, %max) versus isokinetic and isometric torque for the contact sensor, but the accelerometer demonstrated a quadratic (R(2)=0.94) or linear (r(2)=0.83) relationship for the isokinetic and isometric muscle actions, respectively. There were also a number of significant (p<0.05) mean differences between the contact sensor and accelerometer for normalized MMG amplitude or MPF values.

Its contribution to hearing is better understood by examining the force generated by the OHC as a feedback to vibration of the basilar membrane (BM). In this study, we examine the effects of the constraints imposed on the OHC and of the surrounding fluids on the cell's high-frequency active force generated under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The OHC is modeled as a viscoelastic and piezoelectric cylindrical shell coupled with viscous intracellular and extracellular fluids, and the constraint is represented by a spring with adjustable stiffness. The solution is obtained in the form of a Fourier series. The model results are consistent with previously reported experiments under both low- and high-frequency conditions. We find that constrained OHCs achieve a much higher corner frequency than free OHCs, depending on the stiffness of the constraint. We analyze cases in which the stiffness of the constraint is similar to that of the BM, reticular lamina, and tectorial membrane, and find that the force per unit transmembrane potential generated by the OHC can be constant up to several tens of kHz.

{"title": "Mixing in microchannels based on hydrodynamic focusing and time-interleaved segmentation: modelling and experiment.", "abstract": "This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates a micromixer based on combined hydrodynamic focusing and time-interleaved segmentation. Both hydrodynamic focusing and time-interleaved segmentation are used in the present study to reduce mixing path, to shorten mixing time, and to enhance mixing quality. While hydrodynamic focusing reduces the transversal mixing path, time-interleaved sequential segmentation shortens the axial mixing path. With the same viscosity in the different streams, the focused width can be adjusted by the flow rate ratio. The axial mixing path or the segment length can be controlled by the switching frequency and the mean velocity of the flow. Mixing ratio can be controlled by both flow rate ratio and pulse width modulation of the switching signal. This paper first presents a time-dependent two-dimensional analytical model for the mixing concept. The model considers an arbitrary mixing ratio between solute and solvent as well as the axial Taylor-Aris dispersion. A micromixer was designed and fabricated based on lamination of four polymer layers. The layers were machined using a CO2 laser. Time-interleaved segmentation was realized by two piezoelectric valves. The sheath streams for hydrodynamic focusing are introduced through the other two inlets. A special measurement set-up was designed with synchronization of the mixer's switching signal and the camera's trigger signal. The set-up allows a relatively slow and low-resolution CCD camera to freeze and to capture a large transient concentration field. The concentration profile along the mixing channel agrees qualitatively well with the analytical model.

However, the degree of c-axis orientation of the piezoelectric film is, in turn, influenced by other parameters such as the structure of the substrate material, the matter of whether the c-axis is up or down (polarity), and the growth parameters used. The correlation of these three aspects with the electromechanical coupling of the AlN-thin films, is studied here. Thin AlN films, prepared in a magnetron sputtering system, have been deposited onto thin Al, Mo, Ni, Ti, and TiN films. Such thin high-conducting layers are used to form the bottom electrode of TFBAR devices as well as to define a short-circuiting plane in TFSAR devices. In both cases, they serve as a substrate for the growth of the piezoelectric film. It has been found that the degree of orientation and the surface roughness of the bottom metal layer significantly affects the texture of the AlN films, and hence its electroacoustic properties. For this reason, the surface morphology and texture of the metal layers and their influence on the growth of AlN on them has been systematically studied. Finally, FBARs with both Al and Ti electrodes have been fabricated and evaluated electroacoustically.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2005-10-11", "authors": ["Gonzalo FIriarte", "JohanBjurstr\u00f6m", "J\u00f6rgenWestlinder", "FredrikEngelmark", "Ilia VKatardjiev"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2005.1504003"}
{"title": "Analysis of SAW properties in ZnO/AlxGa1-xN/c-Al2O3 structures.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric thin films on high acoustic velocity nonpiezoelectric substrates, such as ZnO, AlN, or GaN deposited on diamond or sapphire substrates, are attractive for high frequency and low-loss surface acoustic wave devices. In this work, ZnO films are deposited on AlxGa1-xN/c-Al2O3 (0 < or = chi < or = 1) substrates using the radio frequency (RF) sputtering technique. In comparison with a single AlxGa1-xN layer deposited on c-Al2O3 with the same total film thickness, a ZnO/AlxGa1-xN/c-Al2O3 multilayer structure provides several advantages, including higher order wave modes with higher velocity and larger electromechanical coupling coefficient (K2). The surface acoustic wave (SAW) velocities and coupling coefficients of the ZnO/AlxGa1-xN/c-Al2O3 structure are tailored as a function of the Al mole percentage in AlxGa1-xN films, and as a function of the ZnO (h1) to AlxGa1-xN (h2) thickness ratio. It is found that a wide thickness-frequency product (hf) region in which coupling is close to its maximum value, K(2)max, can be obtained. The K(2)max of the second order wave mode (h1 = h2) is estimated to be 4.3% for ZnO/GaN/c-Al2O3, and 3.8% for ZnO/AlN/c-Al2O3. The bandwidth of second and third order wave modes, in which the coupling coefficient is within +/- 0.3% of K(2)max, is calculated to be 820 hf for ZnO/GaN/c-Al2O3, and 3620 hf for ZnO/AlN/c-Al2O3. Thus, the hf region in which the coupling coefficient is close to the maximum value broadens with increasing Al content, while K(2)max decreases slightly. When the thickness ratio of AlN to ZnO increases, the K(2)max and hf bandwidth of the second and third higher wave modes increases. The SAW test devices are fabricated and tested. The theoretical and experimental results of velocity dispersion in the ZnO/AlxGa1-xN/c-Al2O3 structures are found to be well matched.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2005-10-11", "authors": ["YingChen", "Nuri WilliamEmanetoglu", "GauravSaraf", "PanWu", "YichengLu", "AniruddhParekh", "VinodMerai", "EricUdovich", "DongLu", "Dong SLee", "Eric AArmour", "MilanPophristic"], "doi": "10.1109/tuffc.2005.1504002"}

Adducted proteins were isolated from complimentary gels and identified by peptide mass mapping. A total of 18 adducted proteins were identified including: protein disulfide isomerase precursor, ER-60 protease, alpha actin, mouse urinary proteins, and cytochrome b5 reductase. In supernatant fractions, protein disulfide isomerase, heat shock protein 70, and alpha-actin were key proteins to which reactive naphthalene metabolites were bound. All of the proteins adducted, with the exception of cytochrome b5 reductase were sulfhydryl rich.

Detection conditions were then explored and optimized. Results showed that PBS buffer of pH 6.8, an ion concentration of 20 mmol/liter, and a probe concentration of 1.5 micromol/liter were optimal for the detection system. Under such optimized experimental conditions, the specificity of bis-PNA was proved much higher than that of DNA probe.

Measurement of the time for transmission of ultrasonic pulses between the implanted crystals provided a continuous recording of inter-crystal distance and hence esophageal muscle length.\nFollowing cumulative intravenous administration, 5-HT (1-100 microg/kg), tegaserod (1-1000 microg/kg), BIMU-8 (3-3000 microg/kg), renzapride (10-3000 microg/kg), cisapride (30-3000 microg/kg), and mosapride (30-10,000 microg/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in esophageal inter-crystal distance. The mean ED50 values for tegaserod, BIMU-8, renzapride, cisapride, and mosapride were 11, 49, 51, 141, and 1825 microg/kg, respectively.

{"title": "Effect of modulation of serotonergic, cholinergic, and nitrergic pathways on murine fundic size and compliance measured by ultrasonomicrometry.", "abstract": "Reduced fasting or postprandial gastric volumes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia. The mechanisms that underlie the control of gastric fundic volume are incompletely understood, partly because of an inability to accurately measure fundic volume in vivo in small animals. Small animals are useful models to evaluate mechanisms, e.g., in knockout animals. The aim of this study was to determine whether an ultrasonometric technique accurately monitors fundic contraction and relaxation in mice in vivo and to determine the effect of modulation of cholinergic, nitrergic, and serotonergic pathways on fundic size and compliance in the intact mouse innervated stomach. Two to four piezoelectric crystals (diameter 1 mm, 24-microm resolution) were glued to the serosal side of fundus and used to measure distance. Validation studies showed excellent correlation between measured changes and actual changes in distances between crystals and excellent reproducibility. The expected responses to pharmacological modulation with bethanechol and nitroglycerin were demonstrated. Atropine increased the distance between the crystals, suggesting a baseline cholinergic regulation of fundic volume. Bethanechol, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, and the 5-HT1B/D agonist sumatriptan decreased the distance between the crystals, suggesting fundic contraction. Atropine, nitroglycerin, and buspirone caused an increase in intercrystal distance consistent with fundic relaxation. Fundic compliance was investigated by changing intragastric pressure via an implanted catheter. Sumatriptan increased compliance, whereas buspirone increased the distance between crystals but did not change compliance. The data suggest that ultrasonomicrometry is a useful tool that can reproducibly and accurately measure changes in fundic size and the response to pharmacological agents.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The apnea-hypopnea index was computed using two definitions for hypopnea. Hypopnea-1 was defined as a 50% reduction in flow for > or = 10 s in duration. Hypopnea-2 was defined as any reduction in airflow for > or = 10 s associated with a 3% drop in the arterial oxygen saturation or followed by an arousal. The level of agreement (kappa) for the sensors was determined by comparing whether or not they identified candidate events determined by a second blinded scorer.\nFor the apnea-hypopnea-1 index (mean +/- SD), the event rate for the pneumotachograph (26.0 +/- 27.9 events/h) was slightly greater than that for the PVDF sensor (20.1 +/- 27.1 events/h; p < 0.05).

{"title": "Controlled agitation during hybridization: surface acoustic waves are shaking up microarray technology.", "abstract": "Microarray hybridization experiments are mostly based on quite small sample volumes being confined between the microarray itself and a cover slip or lifter slip on top of the narrow fluid layer. Under such conditions, the system is governed by the rules of microfluidics, i.e., by the regime of small Reynold's numbers. Here, diffusion is the only source for moving sample molecules toward their target spots. However, for a typical macromolecule such as that used in microarray hybridization experiments, the diffusion constant is very small. Hence, because they are driven by diffusion only, traveling over typical distances on a microarray may take them a very long time. Additionally, the slow time constants associated with the diffusion limit lead to pronounced depletion effects, which strongly influence the dynamics of a hybridization assay. In this report, we describe a novel technique to overcome the diffusion limit in microarray hybridization experiments. Surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate are coupled with the sample fluid on a microarray, where they act as a highly efficient agitation source. We demonstrate that the diffusion limit can be overcome in this fashion, leading to a remarkable increase in signal intensity and homogeneity in fluorescence-labeled microarray assays.", "journal": "Methods in molecular medicine", "date": "2005-09-15", "authors": ["AchimWixforth"], "doi": "10.1385/1-59259-923-0:121"}

Recent advances in the fields of computer programming and computer chip technology have led to the myriad development of RRPs, which contain sensors that automatically adjust the pacing rate to match the physiologic changes that occur during physical exertion. Because patients with RRPs may experience heart rate changes in the operating room due to ''normal'' sensor function, anesthesiologists must be aware of the new developments in RRP sensor technology to properly manage these patients. Increases in respiratory rate and tidal volume as well as the use of electrocautery have been reported to accelerate the paced rate of pacemakers with minute ventilation sensors. Likewise, patient movement and saws that produce vibrations can accelerate the paced rate of patients with piezoelectric crystal sensors. This paper discusses the history of pacemaker development, reviews the currently used RRP sensors, and recommends procedures for the perioperative management of these patients.

The circuit design consists of a circuit with a piezoelectric quartz crystal (SPQC) and a pair of electrodes. This system can provide dynamic data monitoring on a web-page via the Internet.

The model includes the electrical properties of the cell membrane, piezoelectricity associated with a membrane motor mechanism, and mechanosensitive channels in the cell lateral wall. The outer hair cell is loaded by the vibrating basilar and tectorial membranes, and this loading generates strain in the lateral wall. Our analysis reveals a property, the strain rate sensitivity, that, in concert with the piezoelectric effect, can enhance the cell frequency response. We discuss possible viscoelastic-type mechanisms of the channel's strain rate sensitivity that is consistent with the organization of the composite cell lateral wall. The parameters of our model are chosen on the basis of the previously estimated electrical and piezoelectric properties as well as typical conductance and density of the mechanosensitive channels in cells. We found that the strain rate sensitivity of the channels can result in receptor potentials greater than those predicted by the RC (resistance and capacitance) analysis.

{"title": "Extension to the definition of quasistatic material coupling factor to include losses.", "abstract": "In general the coupling factor is a dimensionless coefficient, defined as a particular combination of the dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric coefficients that may be useful for the internal energy conversion description in piezoelectric materials. In order to extend the definition of the quasistatic coupling factor as ratio of energies to dynamic conditions and to lossy materials, its current definition and its derivation are reviewed. It is shown that this parameter can be computed as ratio of energies also in dynamic conditions, and the factors obtained in the static and the dynamic case are simply related by a proportionality coefficient. The coupling factor is computed as the square root of the ratio between the converted (from mechanical to electrical or vice versa) and the total energy involved in a transformation cycle for lossy materials in quasistatic conditions, obtaining a complex quantity related to the complex material parameters taking the losses into account. In order to apply this definition to the element vibrating around its resonance frequency, the kinetic is considered as the total energy and the electrical potential as the converted energy. The obtained result is a complex quantity related to the complex material coupling factor by means of the same proportionality coefficient of the case without losses. Finally, it is shown that both the material and the dynamic coupling factors still can be considered as real parameters for real lossy materials.

The transduction mechanism is based upon the detection of acoustically induced changes in the optical thickness of a thin polymer film acting as a Fabry-Perot sensing interferometer (FPI). By illuminating the sensor with a large-area laser beam and mechanically scanning a photodiode across the reflected output beam, while using a novel angle-tuned phase bias control system to optimally set the FPI working point, a notional 2-D ultrasound array was synthesized. To demonstrate the concept, 1-D and 2-D ultrasound field distributions produced by planar 3.5-MHz and focused 5-MHz PZT ultrasound transducers were mapped. The system was also evaluated by performing transmission ultrasound imaging of a spatially calibrated target. The \"array\" aperture, defined by the dimensions of the incident optical field, was elliptical, of dimensions 16 x 12 mm and spatially sampled in steps of 0.1 mm or 0.2 mm. Element sizes, defined by the photodiode aperture, of 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mm were variously used for these experiments. Two types of sensor were evaluated.

{"title": "Double frequency piezoelectric transducer design for harmonic imaging purposes in NDT.", "abstract": "Harmonic imaging (HI) has emerged as a very promising tool for medical imaging, although there has been little published work using this technique in ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT). The core of the technique, which uses nonlinear propagation effects arising in the medium due to the microstructure or the existence of defects, is the ability to design transducers capable of emitting at one frequency and receiving at twice this frequency. The transducers that have been used so far are usually double crystal configurations with coaxial geometry, and commonly using a disc surrounded by a ring. Such a geometry permits the design of broadband transducers if each transducer element is adapted to the medium with its corresponding matching layers. Nevertheless, the different geometry of the emission and reception apertures creates difficulties when resolving the images. In this work, a new transducer design with different emission and reception apertures is resented. It makes use of the traditional construction procedures used to make piezocomposite transducers and the well-known theory of the mode coupling in piezoelectric resonators when the lateral dimensions are comparable with the thickness of the piezoceramic. In this work the design, construction, and characterization of a prototype to be used in NDT of metallic materials is presented.

{"title": "Effects of repeated hyperbaric nitrogen-oxygen exposures on the striatal dopamine release and on motor disturbances in rats.", "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated disruptions of motor activities and a decrease of extracellular dopamine level in the striatum of rats exposed to high pressure of nitrogen. Men exposed to nitrogen pressure develop also motor and cognitive disturbances related to inert gas narcosis. After repetitive exposures, adaptation to narcosis was subjectively reported. To study the effects of repetitive exposures to hyperbaric nitrogen-oxygen, male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted in the striatum with multifiber carbon dopamine-sensitive electrodes. After recovery from surgery, free-moving rats were exposed for 2 h up to 3 MPa of nitrogen-oxygen mixture before and after one daily exposure to 1 MPa of nitrogen-oxygen, for 5 consecutive days. Dopamine release was measured by differential pulse voltammetry and motor activities were quantified using piezo-electric captor. At the first exposure to 3 MPa, the striatal dopamine level decreased during the compression (-15%) to reach -20% during the stay at 3 MPa. Motor activities were increased during compression (+15%) and the first 60 min at constant pressure (+10%). In contrast, at the second exposure to 3 MPa, an increase of dopamine of +15% was obtained during the whole exposure. However, total motor activities remained unchanged as compared to the first exposure. Our results confirm that nitrogen exposure at 3 MPa led to a decreased striatal dopamine release and increased motor disturbances in na\u00efve rats. Repetitive exposures to 1 MPa of nitrogen induced a reversal effect on the dopamine release which suggests a neurochemical change at the level of the neurotransmitter regulation processes of the basal ganglia. In contrast, motor activity remained quantitatively unchanged, thus suggesting that dopamine is not involved alone in modulating these motor disturbances.", "journal": "Brain research", "date": "2005-08-23", "authors": ["C\u00e9cileLavoute", "MichelWeiss", "Jean-ClaudeRostain"], "doi": "10.1016/j.brainres.2005.07.004"}

The absence of wiring between driver and transducer provides excellent pulse control possibilities and eliminates the need for broad band matching networks.

System behavior and power consumption are simulated using SPICE models of the ultrasound transducer together with transistor level modelling of the driver stage. Measurements and simulations are presented of system power consumption and echo energy in a pulse echo setup. It is shown that the power consumption varies with the excitation pulse width, which also affects the received ultrasound energy in a pulse echo setup. The measured power consumption for a 16 mm diameter 4.4 MHz piezoelectric transducer varies between 95 microW and 130 microW at a repetition frequency of 1 kHz.

Shape and size of the bone chips were compared by means of morphometrical analysis. Outgrowing osteoblasts were identified by means of alkaline phosphatase activity (AP), immunhistochemical staining for osteocalcin (OC) synthesis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction phenotyping.\nIn 88.9% of the RD and 87.9% of the PS specimens, an outgrowth of adherent cells nearby the bone chips was observed after 6-19 days. Confluence of cells was reached after 4 weeks. Positive staining for AP and OC identified the cells as osteoblasts. The morphometrical analysis revealed a statistically significant more voluminous size of the particles collected with PS than RD.\nWithin the limits of the present study, it may be concluded that both the harvesting methods are not different from each other concerning their detrimental effect on viability and differentiation of cells growing out of autogenous bone chips derived from intra-oral cortical sites.", "journal": "Journal of clinical periodontology", "date": "2005-08-18", "authors": ["GChiriac", "MHerten", "FSchwarz", "DRothamel", "JBecker"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-051X.2005.00809.x"}

Subjects walked on a treadmill in a VR environment and a non-VR environment at each of three walking speeds: 0.9, 1.1, and 1.3 m/s. In the VR environment, an endless corridor with colored vertical stripes comprising the walls was projected onto a hemispherical screen placed in front of the treadmill. The speed of the moving corridor image was matched to the speed of the treadmill to create the illusion that subjects were walking through the endless corridor. Spatiotemporal data during gait were collected with an instrumented treadmill housing two piezoelectric force platforms. Gait parameters reflective of gait instability (stride length, step width, variability in stride velocity, and variability in step width) were compared between the VR and non-VR environments. Subjects walked in the VR environment with reduced stride lengths (p = 0.001), increased step widths (p = 0.001), and with increased variability in stride velocity (p < 0.001) and step width (p = 0.002).

Analysis of the low-amplitude shear wave pattern in the samples allowed the material stiffness and viscous loss properties (complex shear stiffness) to be identified with high spatial resolution. microMRE experiments were conducted at 11.74 T in a 56-mm vertical bore magnet with a 10 mm diameterx75 mm length cylindrical space available for the elastography imaging system.

Shear wave motion propagated through the frog oocyte nucleus, enabling the measurement of its shear stiffness, and in vitro shear wave images displayed contrast between adipogenic and osteogenic tissue-engineered constructs.

At weak signal excitation of the first resonance mode, the displacement at the end of a lateral bar is proportional to the Q31d31 figure of merit that is very close to that found for hard PZT. Indeed the very large piezoelectric coefficient compensates the low Qm. But increasing alternating current (AC) field results in the appearance of strong non-linearities through a shift of the resonance frequency and jumps phenomenon observed on increasing and decreasing frequency sweep. It is shown in this paper that these nonlinearities are due to the nonlinear elastic compliance that can be modeled by a third order development of the constitutive piezoelectric equations. Experiments on PMN-PT and PZN-PT single crystals are used for comparison with the model to show the viability of the approach. Both the frequency shift and jumps phenomenon are simulated with a very good agreement with experimental results. The importance is also shown of losses associated with the third order term responsible for the large decrease of the mechanical quality factor for high strain levels.

Applications include gas and oil wells, high-power duplexers in communication systems, and automobile and aerospace combustion engines. Under these high-temperature and power-operating conditions, which can reach several hundred degrees Centigrade, the typically fabricated aluminum (A1) thin film interdigital transducer (IDT) fails due to electro and stress migration.

We present a unique study in determining the influence of mercury on the microdynamics of the pipette. The effort contains both numerical simulations and corresponding experimental verification. Ultimately we offer two critical results: (1) The mercury column increases the mass loading and expectedly decreases the natural frequencies of the pipette and (2) The lateral oscillations, which play a destructive role in piercing, are subdued in amplitude due to the mass loading of mercury.

The hydrophone was implemented as a tapered fiber optic (FO) probe sensor with a tip diameter of approximately 7 microm. Such small physical dimensions of the sensor eliminate the need for spatial averaging corrections so that true pressure-time (p-t) waveforms can be faithfully recorded. The theoretical considerations that predicted the FO probe sensitivity to be equal to 4.3 mV/MPa are presented along with a brief description of the manufacturing process. The calibration results that verified the theoretically predicted sensitivity are also presented along with a brief description of the improvements being currently implemented to increase this sensitivity level by approximately 20 dB. The results of preliminary measurements indicate that the fiber optic probes will exhibit a uniform frequency response and a zero phase shift in the frequency range considered.

Bulk acoustic wave (BAW), delay lines, traveling wave amplifiers, and oscillators were developed. Although these elegant functional devices never made it into the realm of full-scale production and application, the piezoelectric semiconductor developments of the 1960s provided an exciting time for theoretical explanations and creative experimentation to explore device capabilities for electronic systems applications. Delay lines were formed from rectangular parallelepiped blocks of piezoelectric semiconductors with integral input and output transducers depleted of carriers at each end of the block. The ultrasonic traveling wave amplifier was based on the interaction of electrons under a bias field moving with a velocity faster than the piezoelectric field accompanying the acoustic traveling wave. The gain factor in a piezoelectric semiconductor under direct current bias was used to develop oscillators.

MAb 3G2 recognized with high specificity an antigen ionically bound within the primary cell wall and in the culture medium of microcluster cells. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel analysis and blotting of proteins on PVDF membrane showed that MAb 3G2 detected a single polypeptide of apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.2, designated EP48.

In the absence of EC, MF alone achieved less than a 0.5-log removal of MS2 virus, but, as the iron-coagulant dosage increased, the log virus removal increased dramatically. More than 4-log virus removal, as required by the Surface Water Treatment Rule, was achieved with 6-9 mg/L Fe(3+). The experimental data indicated that at lower iron dosages and pH (< approximately 8 mgFe/L and pH 6.3 and 7.3) negatively charged MS2 viruses first adsorbed onto the positively charged iron hydroxide floc particles before being removed by MF. At higher iron dosages and pH (> approximately 9 mgFe/L and pH 8.3), virus removal was attributed predominantly to enmeshment and subsequent removal by MF. Additionally, the experimental data showed no obvious influence of ionic strength in the natural water range of 10(-7)-10(-2)M on MS2 virus removal by EC-MF. Finally, EC pretreatment significantly outperformed chemical coagulation pretreatment for virus removal. The proposed mechanism for this improved performance by EC is that locally higher iron and virus concentrations and locally lower pH near the anode improved MS2 enmeshment by iron flocs as well as adsorption of MS2 viruses onto the iron floc particles.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2005-07-19", "authors": ["BintuanZhu", "Dennis AClifford", "ShankararamanChellam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.watres.2005.05.020"}

We systematically optimized the method before use on lung tissues. Changing the GST-RBD protein induction temperature from the original 37 to 30 degrees C produced a consistently greater yield of fusion protein. To improve stability of the GST-RBD beads so as to perform large-scale experiments, 0.1% NaN(3) was added. NaN(3)-treated beads retained full affinity for at least 24 days. Sensitivity was improved by using a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane rather than nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. We also compared our GST-RBD beads with two commercial assay kits and found that our beads had both superior sensitivity and reduced variability.

A sperm suspension from cauda epididymides of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was prepared with or without ultrasonic treatment. The sonicated and non-sonicated sperm suspensions were processed for freeze-thawing (FT groups; 100 microl sample was cooled in liquid nitrogen vapor, stored for 1 day at--196 degrees C, and thawed in a 25 degrees C water bath) and freeze-drying (FD groups; 100 microl sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen for 20 s, lyophilized for 6 h, stored at 4 degrees C for 2 days, and rehydrated with 100 microl ultrapure water), or were subjected to immediate use for ICSI (fresh control groups). The sperm heads were microinjected into denuded SD oocytes using a piezo-driven micropipette 2-4 microm in diameter. The presumptive zygotes were transferred into oviducts of pseudopregnant Wistar female rats. Viable rat offspring were produced from all six experimental groups. Ultrasonic treatment of rat spermatozoa was effective in increasing the offspring rate (23.3% vs 6.7% in fresh control groups, 35.0% vs 7.6% in FT groups, 9.2% vs 2.5% in FD groups). The acrosomal region appeared to be intact even after ultrasonic FT and FD treatments as well as in the fresh controls, while the lateral dorsal region of the sperm membrane was more or less damaged in the sonicated, FT and FD samples. Thus, the successful participation of freeze-dried spermatozoa in full-term development was demonstrated by applying ICSI in the rat.", "journal": "Zygote (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2005-06-30", "authors": ["MasumiHirabayashi", "MegumiKato", "JunyaIto", "ShinichiHochi"], "doi": "10.1017/s096719940500300x"}

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to characterize the surface morphology of the resultant imprinted film. The piezoelectric technique and electrochemical impedance technique were also employed to investigate the binding performance of the sol-gel-imprinted film with the template protein. The results showed that the imprinted PQC film can give selective recognition to the template protein. The effects of salts and solvents on the binding capacity of the imprinted film with protein were discussed in detail. Other influencing factors (temperature and pH) have also been investigated.

The compact and cost-effective interferometer utilizes the self-mixing effect when laser light reflected from a moving target re-enters the laser cavity and causes phase dependent changes of the lasing intensity. A piezo positioner was used to displace the interferometer with known frequency and amplitude as a basis for real-time calibration of the interferometer's sensitivity. The signal-processing algorithm is described that allows measurements in presence of high amplitude noise leading to variation of the interferometer's operating point. Measurements of sound-induced basilar membrane displacements were made in the intact cochleae of rodents by focusing the laser beam of the interferometer through the transparent round window membrane.

The change in a crystal, induced by an external electric field, is separated into two contributions. The first one is related to a pure polarization of an electron subsystem, while the second contribution can be reduced to the displacements of the rigid pseudoatoms from their equilibrium positions. It is shown that a change of the X-ray diffraction intensities mainly originates from the second contribution, while the influence of the pure polarization of a crystal electron subsystem is negligibly small. The quantities restored from an X-ray diffraction experiment in the presence of an external electric field were analyzed in detail in terms of a rigid pseudoatomic model of electron density and harmonic approximation for the atomic thermal motion. Explicit relationships are derived that link the properties of phonon spectra with E-field-induced variations of a structure factor, pseudoatomic displacements and piezoelectric strains. The displacements can be numerically estimated using a model of independent atomic motion if the Debye-Waller factors and pseudoatomic charges are known either from a previous single-crystal X-ray diffraction study or from density functional theory calculations. The above estimations can be used to develop an optimum strategy for a data collection that avoids the measurements of reflections insensitive to the electric-field-induced variations.", "journal": "Acta crystallographica.

{"title": "Injection of glutamate into the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei of anesthetized rat causes respiratory dysrhythmia and alters EEG and EMG power.", "abstract": "The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) has been shown to have important functions relevant to the regulation of behavioral states and various motor control systems, including breathing control. Our previous work has shown that the activation of neurons within the PPT, a structure that is typically active during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, can produce respiratory disturbances in freely moving and anesthetized rats. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that respiratory modulation by the PPT in anesthetized rats can be evoked in the absence of other signs of an REM-sleep-like state. We characterized electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) changes during respiratory disturbances induced by glutamatergic stimulation of the PPT in spontaneously breathing, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine combination or with nembutal. Respiratory movements were monitored by a piezoelectric strain gauge. Two-barrel glass pipettes were used to pressure inject glutamate, to probe for respiratory effective sites within the PPT, and to inject oil red dye at the end of the experiments for histological verification of the injection sites. The EEGs were recorded from the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and from the pons contralateral from the injection site. The EMGs were recorded from the genioglossus muscle. The initial response to glutamate injection into the respiratory modulating region of the PPT was always a respiratory pattern disturbance. Subsequent activation of EMG and EEG often occurred in ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized rats, but REM-sleep-like patterns were not observed. Respiratory pattern and EMG power changes in nembutal-anesthetized rats were similar, but EEG activation was never observed. Thus, we conclude that respiratory suppression produced by the local activation of PPT neurons may not necessarily be accompanied by an REM-sleep-like cortical state in this anesthetized model.", "journal": "Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung", "date": "2005-06-22", "authors": ["JasnaSaponjic", "MiodragRadulovacki", "David WCarley"], "doi": "10.1007/s11325-005-0010-5"}

Cell morphology was observed by photomicroscope. Cell growth and differentiated characteristic function were separately assayed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction activity and amylase activity. Results indicated that behaviors of acinar cells on materials might differ to a great extent depending on the surface hydrophilicity and morphology of the materials. On the relatively hydrophobic materials, the abilities of acinar cells to adhere and proliferate increased simultaneously. In addition, porous PVDF had higher cell growth compared with dense PVDF. Therefore, the hydrophobic PVDF with a porous structure was the best substrate for culturing acinar cells.

Previously we have shown a decrease of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in tissues of diabetic patients. The mitochondrial proteins, which regulate the mitochondrial biogensis, including transcription and replication of mtDNA, are encoded by nuclear DNA. Despite the potential function of the proteins bound to the D-loop region of mtDNA in regulating mtDNA transcription/replication, only a few proteins are known to bind the D-loop region of mtDNA. The functional association of these known proteins with insulin resistance is weak. In this study, we applied proteomic analysis to identify a group of proteins (proteome) that physically bind to D-loop DNA of mtDNA. We amplified D-loop DNA (1.1 kb) by PCR and conjugated the PCR fragments to CNBr-activated sepharose. Mitochondria fractions were isolated by both differential centrifugation and Optiprep-gradient ultracentrifugation. The D-loop DNA binding proteome fractions were enriched via this affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins on the gel were transferred onto PVDF membrane and the peptide sequences of each band were subsequently analyzed by capillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC/MS/MS). We identified many D-loop DNA binding proteins, including mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA, Tfam) and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSBP) which were known to bind to mtDNA.

{"title": "A 63 element 1.75 dimensional ultrasound phased array for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.", "abstract": "Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are very common diseases in older American men, thus having a reliable treatment modality for both diseases is of great importance. The currently used treating options, mainly surgical ones, have numerous complications, which include the many side effects that accompany such procedures, besides the invasive nature of such techniques. Focused ultrasound is a relatively new treating modality that is showing promising results in treating prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus this technique is gaining more attention in the past decade as a non-invasive method to treat both diseases.\nIn this paper, the design, construction and evaluation of a 1.75 dimensional ultrasound phased array to be used for treating prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia is presented. With this array, the position of the focus can be controlled by changing the electrical power and phase to the individual elements for electronically focusing and steering in a three dimensional volume. The array was designed with a maximum steering angle of +/- 13.5 degrees in the transverse direction and a maximum depth of penetration of 11 cm, which allows the treatment of large prostates. The transducer piezoelectric ceramic, matching layers and cable impedance have been designed for maximum power transfer to tissue.\nTo verify the capability of the transducer for focusing and steering, exposimetry was performed and the results correlated well with the calculated field. Ex vivo experiments using bovine tissue were performed with various lesion sizes and indicated the capability of the transducer to ablate tissue using short sonications.\nA 1.75 dimensional array, that overcame the drawbacks associated with one-dimensional arrays, has been designed, built and successfully tested. Design issues, such as cable and ceramic capacitances, were taken into account when designing this array.

Designed on bioencapsulation technologies, we generated an in vitro depot that acts as a continuous delivery system for the anti-idiotypic antibody ACA125hFc. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with the anti-idiotypic chimeric antibody ACA125hFc, which mimics the CA125 tumor antigen and which consists of variable regions of the monoclonal murine antibody ACA125 (currently in clinical trial) and the human IgG Fc domain.

Antagonists to ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; CGS 19755, memantine) and non-NMDA (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) glutamate receptors did not affect mechanotransduction. In normal Krebs solution, the P2X purinoreceptor agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP reduced mechanoreceptor firing evoked by distension but simultaneously relaxed circular smooth muscle and inhibited stretch-induced contractions. Neither ATP nor alpha,beta-methylene ATP affected mechanotransduction when transduction sites were directly compressed with von Frey hairs. The P2 purinoreceptor antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid did not affect stretch-induced firing but reduced the inhibitory effect of alpha,beta-methylene ATP on stretch-induced firing. Under isometric conditions, blocking synaptic transmission in Ca2+-free solution reduced stretch-evoked firing but not when basal tension was restored to control levels. Under isotonic condition, Ca2+-free solution did not significantly affect load-evoked firing. The blockers of mechanogated and/or transient receptor potential channels, benzamil, Gd3+, SKF 96365, and ruthenium red inhibited stretch-induced firing but, in parallel, significantly reduced stretch-induced contractions. Benzamil and SKF 96365 were able to inhibit mechanotransduction when transduction sites were compressed with von Frey hairs. The results show that mechanotransduction is rapid but does not depend on fast exocytotic release of mediators. It is likely that stretch-activated ion channels on rIGLEs are involved in direct, physical mechanotransduction by rectal low-threshold mechanoreceptors.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "GaPO4 sensors for gravimetric monitoring during atomic layer deposition at high temperatures.", "abstract": "The quartz crystal microbalance is extremely useful for in situ monitoring of thin-film growth by atomic layer deposition (ALD) in a viscous flow environment. Unfortunately, conventional AT-quartz sensors are limited to growth temperatures below approximately 300 degrees C. Gallium orthophosphate (GaPO4) is an alternative piezoelectric material offering much greater high-temperature frequency stability than AT-quartz (SiO2). Our measurements reveal that the temperature coefficient for Y-11 degrees GaPO4 decreases linearly with temperature reaching 3 Hz/ degrees C at 450 degrees C. In contrast, the temperature coefficient for the SiO2 sensor increases as the cube of the sensor temperature to 650 Hz/ degrees C at 390 degrees C. To examine the effect of temperature fluctuations on the sensor frequency, we exposed the SiO2 and GaPO4 sensors to helium pulses at 400 degrees C. The resulting frequency change measured for the SiO2 sensor was approximately 40 times greater than that of the GaPO4 sensor. Next, we performed Al2O3 ALD using alternating tri-methylaluminum/water exposures at 400 degrees C and monitored the growth using the SiO2 and GaPO4 sensors. The GaPO4 sensor yielded well-defined pulse shapes in agreement with predictions, while the SiO2 pulses were severely distorted. Measurements during TiO2 ALD using alternating titanium tetrachloride/water exposures at 450 degrees C with the GaPO4 sensor also showed well-defined ALD mass steps.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2005-06-01", "authors": ["J WElam", "M JPellin"], "doi": "10.1021/ac050349a"}

A second microphone was positioned at an external site, lateral to the trachea, just below the thyroid notch. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was stimulated supramaximally using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 s. Onset, maximum effect, and offset of NMB were measured and compared. Peak effect, time to reach (T) 25%, 75%, and 90% of control twitch response, and TOF recovery to TOF ratios 0.5-0.8 were significantly longer at the external site. The onset time was not significantly different between the two sites. We used phonomyography with a microphone placed at the neck to evaluate the possibility to externally monitor NMB at the larynx.

{"title": "An efficient proteomics-based approach for the screening of autoantibodies.", "abstract": "This study presents an improved method for the complete transfer of proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to a membrane, specifically designed for the screening and identification of antigens recognized by autoantibodies in patients with breast cancer (BCP) and healthy volunteers. This paper reports the evaluation of this technique using proteins from MCF7 as a source of antigens following 2-DE separation. The appropriate quantity of protein to be loaded on gels (150 microg) has been determined, the aim being a complete and reproducible recovery of all separated proteins onto the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (2D-blot) after a semi-dry electrotransfer. Several different transfer methods were tested in parallel, resulting in the selection and optimisation of one using a discontinuous buffer system, based on the isotachophoresis theory. To facilitate the comparative analysis of the different sets of 2D-blots probed with individual sera from BCP and healthy volunteers, the 2D-blots were stained with colloidal gold following the immunodetection step. The gels and 2D-blots were scanned and analysed by imaging software. The matching permitted exact localisation of particular relevant protein spots hybridised by antibodies on the 2D-blots. These spots were subsequently located on preparative gels for identification by mass spectrometry. A set of 40 2D-blots was probed with 20 sera from patients with breast cancer and 20 sera from healthy volunteers. In the protein profiles submitted to immunodetection, 15 proteins were repeatedly immunodetected by both BCP and sera from healthy people. Those proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Conversely, some protein isoforms were preferentially immunodetected by BCP sera and may reflect the presence of this cancer.

Detection of thermoelastically induced pressure transients allows reconstruction of optical properties of the sample to a depth of several millimeters with a spatial resolution of 24 mum. Acoustic detection is performed using a specially designed piezoelectric transducer, which is transparent for optical radiation. Thus, ultrasonic signals can be recorded at the same position the tissue is illuminated. Because the optoacoustical sound source is placed in the pulsed-acoustic near field of the pressure sensor, signal distortions commonly associated with acoustical diffraction are eliminated. Therefore, the acoustic signals mimic exactly the depth profile of the absorbed energy.

{"title": "Metal microcrystal pollutants: the heat resistant, transmissible nucleating agents that initiate the pathogenesis of TSEs?", "abstract": "This paper exposes the flaws in the conventional consensus on the origins of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) which decrees that the protein-only misfolded 'prion' represents the primary aetiological transmissible agent, and then reviews/presents the emerging data which indicates that environmental exposure to metal microcrystal pollutants (sourced from munitions, etc.) represents the heat resistant, transmissible nucleating agents which seed the metal-prion protein (PrP)-ferritin fibril crystals that cause TSE. Fresh analytical data is presented on the levels of metals in ecosystems which support populations affected by clusters of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD), sporadic/familial CJD, and the scrapie types of TSE that have emerged in the UK, Sicily, Sardinia, Calabria and Japan. This data further substantiates the abnormal geochemical template (e.g., elevated strontium (Sr), barium (Ba) and silver (Ag)) which was observed as a common hallmark of the TSE cluster ecosystems across North America, thereby supporting the hypothesis that these microcrystals serve as the piezoelectrion nucleators which seed the growth/multireplication of the aberrant metal-PrP-ferritin fibril features which characterise the neuropathology of the TSE diseased brain. A secondary pathogenic mechanism entails the inactivation of the sulphated proteoglycans which normally regulate the mineralisation process. This can be induced by a rogue metal mediated chelation of free sulphur, or by contamination with organo-sulphur pollutants that substitute at natural sulphur bonds, or via a mutation to the S-proteoglycan cell line; thereby enabling the aberrant overgrowth of rogue fibril crystal formations that possess a piezoelectric capacity which compromises the ability of the contaminated individual to process incoming acoustic/tactile pressure waves in the normal way. The crystals transduce incoming sonic energy into electrical energy, which, in turn, generates magnetic fields on the crystal surfaces that initiate chain reactions of free radical mediated spongiform neurodegeneration. Metal microcrystal nucleating agents provide a group of plausible aetiological candidates that explain the unique properties of the TSE causal agent - such as heat resistance, transmissibility, etc. - which the protein-only prion model fails to fulfill. This paper also discusses the possible nutritional measures that could best be adopted by populations living in high risk TSE ecosystems; as a means of preventing the successful implantation of these rogue microcrystals and their consequent hypermineralisation of the soft tissues within the CNS.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2005-05-24", "authors": ["MarkPurdey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2005.03.018"}

The inhibitor benzoylecgonine-1,8-diamino-3,4-dioxaoctane (BZE-DADOO) was immobilized on a monolayer of 11-mercaptomonoundecanoic acid (MUA) self-assembled on the gold surface of the sensor. The binding of high-molecular-weight cholinesterase to the immobilized cocaine derivative was monitored with a mass sensitive piezoelectric quartz crystal (quartz crystal nanobalance; QCN). In the presence of an inhibiting substance in the sample, the binding of cholinesterase to the immobilized inhibitor was reduced. The decrease of the rate of mass change was proportional to the concentration of free inhibitor in the sample. This way the affinity sensor followed anti-cholinesterase toxicity and the enzyme activity of ChE was not addressed. A assay for detection of organophosphates (OP) was optimized. Regeneration of the sensor surface was achieved with 1 mol L(-1) formic acid, which enabled 40 measurements with one sensor. All assays were carried out in a flow-through arrangement.

We limit our study to three topologically equal smetic (Sm)phases: Sm-C(*), Sm-C(*)(alpha), and Sm-C(*)(A) and show that the reduction of optical purity forces the system from the antiferroelectric to the ferroelectric phase with a possible Sm- C(*)(alpha) between them. The effect of the flexoelectric and the quadratic coupling is considered as well. If the phase diagram includes only two phases, Sm-C* and Sm- C*(A), the flexoelectric coupling is very small. The materials which exhibit the Sm-C(*)(alpha) in a certain range of optical purity and temperature, can be expected to have a significant flexoelectric coupling that is comparable with the piezoelectric coupling.

Seven men (mean +/- SD age, 22.4 +/- 1.3 years) volunteered to perform isometric and concentric isokinetic leg extension muscle actions at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and peak torque (PT) on a Cybex II dynamometer. A piezoelectric MMG recording sensor was placed between bipolar surface EMG electrodes on the vastus medialis. Polynomial regression and separate 1-way repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the EMG amplitude, MMG amplitude, EMG MPF, and MMG MPF data for the isometric and isokinetic muscle actions. For the isometric muscle actions, EMG amplitude (R(2) = 0.999) and MMG MPF (R(2) = 0.946) increased to MVC, mean MMG amplitude increased to 60% MVC and then plateaued, and mean EMG MPF did not change (p > 0.05) across torque levels. For the isokinetic muscle actions, EMG amplitude (R(2) = 0.988) and MMG amplitude (R(2) = 0.933) increased to PT, but there were no significant mean changes with torque for EMG MPF or MMG MPF. The different torque-related responses for EMG and MMG amplitude and MPF may reflect differences in the motor control strategies that modulate torque production for isometric vs. dynamic muscle actions.

{"title": "Roughness and hydrophobicity studies of nanofiltration membranes using different modes of AFM.", "abstract": "Determination of the surface roughness by AFM is crucial to the study of particle fouling in nanofiltration. It is, however, very difficult to compare the different roughness values reported in the literature because of a lack in uniformity in the methods applied to determine surface roughness. AFM is used in both noncontact mode and tapping mode; moreover, the size of the scan area is highly variable. This study compares, for six different nanofiltration membranes (UTC-20, N30F, Desal 51HL, Desal 5DL, NTR7450, NF-PES-10), noncontact mode AFM with tapping mode AFM for several sizes of the scan area. Although the absolute roughness values are different for noncontact AFM and tapping mode AFM, no difference is found between the two modes of AFM in ranking the nanofiltration membranes with respect to their surface roughness. NTR 7450 and NF-PES-10 are the smoothest membranes, while the roughest surface can be found with Desal 51HL and Desal 5DL. UTC-20 and N30F are characterized by an intermediate roughness value. An increase in roughness with increasing scan area is observed for both AFM modes. Larger differences between the roughnesses of the membranes are obtained with tapping mode AFM because of the tapping of the tip on the surface. Phase imaging is an extension of tapping mode AFM, measuring the phase shift between the cantilever oscillation and the oscillation of the piezo driver. This phase shift reflects the interaction between the cantilever and the membrane surface. A comparison with contact angle measurements proves that a small phase shift corresponds to a large contact angle, representing a hydrophobic membrane surface.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2005-05-18", "authors": ["KBoussu", "BVan der Bruggen", "AVolodin", "JSnauwaert", "CVan Haesendonck", "CVandecasteele"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2005.01.095"}

{"title": "Piezoelectric immunochip for the detection of dengue fever in viremia phase.", "abstract": "The global prevalence of dengue fever has grown so dramatically in recent years that it is endemic in more than 100 countries and has become a major international public health concern. Moreover, since the flu-like symptoms that accompany dengue fever are atypical and varied, the detection procedures currently used to identify it are cumbersome and time-consuming, making early stage epidemiological control and effective medical treatment of this epidemic almost impossible. In this study, a QCM-based detection system was developed in which two monoclonal antibodies against dengue E and NS-1 protein, respectively, were control orientated immobilized on QCM via protein A to produce an immunochip. Various sample pretreatment procedures were evaluated to ascertain the most suitable combination, and both the simulating samples and the clinical specimen were examined by the immunochip. The results revealed that the cibacron blue 3GA gel-heat denature (CB-HD) method was the most effective sample pretreatment technique. Due to the complex composition of the serum, the immunochip could only effectively quantify dengue viral antigens in a 1/1000 untreated simulated sample. With the help of the CB-HD method, the dilution folds were found to capable of being reduced from 1000 to 100, and the detection limit lowered to 1.727 microg/ml (E protein) and 0.740 microg/ml (NS-1 protein) in the original sample. While the cocktail immunochip could not quantify both antigens separately, the higher signal level rendered it a more effective qualification tool for suspect screening. Moreover, the results of the analysis of clinical specimens also proved the ability and future potential of cocktail immunochip in discriminating dengue-positive cases from negative serum specimens in the viremia phase.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2005-05-17", "authors": ["Tzong-ZengWu", "Chih-ChengSu", "Li-KuangChen", "Hui-HuaYang", "Dar-FuTai", "Kou-ChengPeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2004.12.019"}

{"title": "Early recognition of regional cardiac ischemia using a 3-axis accelerometer sensor.", "abstract": "Perioperative mortality in coronary artery bypass grafting is usually caused by reduced left ventricular function due to regional myocardial ischemia or infarction. Post-operative graft occlusion is a well-known problem in coronary surgery. A sensitive tool to detect graft occlusion and monitor myocardial function may give the opportunity to revise malfunctioning grafts before departure from the hospital. This paper describes how a new method can detect cardiac ischemia using a 3-axis piezoelectric accelerometer. In three anesthetized pigs, a 3-axis piezoelectric accelerometer was sutured on the lateral free wall of the left ventricle. The left anterior descending (LAD) was occluded for different time periods and the accelerometer data were sampled with a PC. Short-time Fourier transform was calculated based on the accelerometer time series. The results were visualized using a 2D color-coded time-frequency plot. In the area of occlusion, a change to stronger power of higher harmonics was observed. Consequently, a difference value between the instant frequency pattern and a reference frequency pattern showed a rise in absolute value during the occlusion period. The preliminary results indicate that early recognition of regional cardiac ischemia is possible by analyzing accelerometer data acquired from the three animal trials using the prototype 3-axis accelerometer sensor.", "journal": "Physiological measurement", "date": "2005-05-12", "authors": ["Ole JakobElle", "SteinarHalvorsen", "Martin GunnarGulbrandsen", "LarsAurdal", "AndreBakken", "EigilSamset", "HaraldDugstad", "ErikFosse"], "doi": "10.1088/0967-3334/26/4/009"}

The parameters investigated were fabrication, blocking and guide dot concentration, probe concentration and modification, print buffer, humidity during arraying, slide agitation, spot volume and spotter compatibility. The optimum oligonucleotide concentration was 20 microM, while the optimum protein concentration was 0.05 mg/ml. Amino-modified oligonucleotides were best able to be bound to the resin's epoxy groups at pH 8, whereas thiol-modified oligonucleotides displayed an optimum coupling value of pH 7. So as to avoid background (BG) contamination of probes around bright guide dots, the concentration of fluorescent guide dots was set to 1 muM. The most suitable print buffers for oligonucleotide arrays using both piezo- and contact-printing systems proved to be 3 x SSC/1.5 M betaine and commercial ArrayLink. When 0.01% monochlortriazinyl-beta-cyclodextrin sodium salt (MCT) was added, the hybridization signal doubled in strength as compared to plain buffer. The optimum print buffer for proteins was 0.1 N phosphate buffer, pH 8/10% glycerine. The optimum humidity for arraying oligonucleotides was 60% and for proteins 40%.

ESWL treatment was limited to a maximum of three (solitary stones <20 mm diameter) to five sessions (larger solitary or multiple stones) and 3000 pulses per session. Univariate and multivariate analyses of pretreatment and treatment variables were performed to investigate their impact on fragmentation efficacy and stone clearance. A tree-based analysis was used to identify prognostically homogenous subgroups of individuals with maximum benefit from ESWL.\nFour hundred and eight patients, 76% female and 24% male, with a mean age of 46 (SD, 13) years, were selected for evaluation. Cox regression analysis identified three pretreatment variables with significant prognostic impact: (1) number of gallstones >1 (relative risk, 2.6 (95% CI, 1.9-3.5)), (2) size of stones >17 mm (1.7 (1.4-2.2)), and (3) computed tomography (CT) density of stones >55 Hounsfield units (H) (1.4 (1.1-1.8)).

It becomes clear from this decomposition that an inversion layer transducer can be modeled as three elements in series connection, i.e., a clamped capacitance, a classical motional impedance, and a coupled motional impedance. The first two elements make up the classical model of a single element transducer. The coupled motional impedance describes the coupled interaction between the regular and the inverted piezoelectric sublayers, and thus reflects the effect of an inversion layer.

The tonpilz stack consisted of silver/lead zirconate titanate (PZT)/lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3)/silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates. First, conductive LaNiO3 thin films, approximately 300 nm in thickness, were grown on SOI substrates by a metalorganic decomposition (MOD) method.

Subjects viewed stationary numerical digits monocularly within a Badal optical system (at both 0.0 and -3.0 D) while performing a two-alternative, forced-choice paradigm that matched cognitive loading across subjects. Five individually matched cognitive levels of increasing difficulty were used in random order for each subject. Five 20-second, continuous-objective recordings of the accommodative response measured with an open-view infrared autorefractor were obtained for each cognitive level, whereas simultaneous measurement of heart rate was continuously recorded with a finger-mounted piezoelectric pulse transducer for 5 minutes. Fast Fourier transformation of cardiovascular function allowed the relative power of the autonomic components to be assessed in the frequency domain, whereas heart period gave an indication of the time-domain response.\nIncreasing the cognitive demand led to a significant reduction in the accommodative response in all subjects (0.0 D: by -0.35 +/- 0.33 D; -3.0 D: by -0.31 +/- 0.40 D, P < 0.001).

{"title": "A wearable, mobile phone-based respiration monitoring system for sleep apnea syndrome detection.", "abstract": "A new wearable respiration monitoring system has been developed for non-invasive detection of sleep apnea syndrome. The system, which is attached to a shirt, consists of a piezoelectric sensor, a low-power 8-bit single chip microcontroller, EEPROM and a 2.4 GHz low-power transmitting mobile phone (PHS). The piezoelectric sensor, whose electrical polarization voltage is produced by body movements, is installed inside the shirt and closely contacts the patient's chest. The low frequency components of body movements recorded by the sensor are mainly generated by respiration. The microcontroller sequentially stores the movement signal to the EEPROM for 5 minutes and detects, by time-frequency analysis, whether the patient has breathed during that time.

The server computer then creates apnea \"filings\" automatically for every patient. The system can be used at home and be self-applied by patients.

{"title": "Monitoring femoral component installation using vibration testing.", "abstract": "With emerging minimally invasive surgical techniques in total hip arthroplasty, there has been anecdotal evidence of an increase in fractures associated with the insertion of the prosthesis into the femur. The diminished visibility associated with minimally invasive surgical techniques necessitates a greater emphasis on the surgeon's tactile and auditory senses. These senses are used to ascertain the femoral component position of maximum stability and interference fit, as well as to prevent further component impaction and subsequent fracture of the femur. The work described herein attempts to identify a means to supplement the surgeon's tactile and auditory senses by using damage identification techniques normally used in civil and mechanical structures to monitor the insertion process of the prosthesis. It is hypothesized that vibration characteristics of the impact process may be used intraoperatively to determine at what position the femoral component has reached appropriate interference fit and stability in the femur. Such information may be used to prevent further impaction of the femoral component past a threshold that could result in a periprosthetic fracture. A piezoelectric accelerometer and impact hammer will be used to monitor the impact process. The acceleration time history data were analyzed by using low and high pass filters to allow frequency analysis of the time history signals. This paper will summarize features derived from the measured data that will be used to develop an insertion process termination indicator.", "journal": "Biomedical sciences instrumentation", "date": "2005-04-27", "authors": ["SeanaGiardini", "PhillipCornwell", "R MichaelMeneghini"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Imaging articular cartilage under compression--cartilage elastography.", "abstract": "We constructed a device to compress small samples of articular cartilage while the samples were imaged in a 1.5 T imager. With the use of a piezoelectric piston, the device compressed 1-cm-diameter cylindrical samples of articular cartilage (200 microm) at a rate of 2 Hz. Simultaneously, we imaged the samples with a displacement-sensitive stimulated-echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence. We validated the technique using tissue that mimicked silicone samples. We compared the results from the same cartilage samples before and after they were degraded by digestion in trypsin. The extent of degradation was visualized from T(1)-weighted images of the samples after they were soaked in 0.5 mmolar of GdDTPA. The resulting elastographic images show compression and differential strain in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the surface of the cartilage. The static elastographic images that depict compression made before digestion and after 5 and 15 hr of trypsin digestion show that the elastic modulus of the samples decreased with a spatial variation consistent with the enzymatic digestion as revealed by the T(1) images. We believe this technique will be useful in studies of the mechanical properties of articular cartilage and other tissues, and may in the future be extended to the clinical setting.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2005-04-22", "authors": ["Peter AHardy", "Anne CRidler", "Cameron BChiarot", "Don BPlewes", "R MarkHenkelman"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.20439"}

These showed significant homologies with known cydAB gene sequences from various organisms. Additionally, highly conserved regions that are important for the enzymatic function were also conserved in cydA of S. violacea. Based on the results, transcriptional analysis of cydAB operon and cydDC operon (required for assembly of cytochrome bd) of S. violacea in microaerobic condition was performed under the growth condition of various pressures. The gene of cydA was expressed even under the condition of atmospheric pressure and its expression was enhanced with pressurization. On the other hand, the expression of cydC was strongly depressed under the condition of atmospheric pressure compared with the case under high pressure. It appeared spectrophotometrically that loss of cytochrome bd in S. violacea under atmospheric pressure shown in previous study is caused mainly by the loss of cydDC. Further, under the growth condition of atmospheric pressure, either less amount or no d-type cytochrome was expressed compared with the case of high-pressure condition even if the organism was grown under alkaline condition or in the presence of uncoupler, which are the inducible condition of d-type cytochrome in Escherichia coli. These results suggested that the significant amount of d-type cytochrome expression is specific event under the growth condition of high pressure.", "journal": "Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions", "date": "2005-04-22", "authors": ["HideyukiTamegai", "HiroakiKawano", "AkihiroIshii", "SayakaChikuma", "KaoruNakasone", "ChiakiKato"], "doi": "10.1007/s00792-005-0439-2"}

{"title": "Residual aqueous ozone determination by gas diffusion reverse flow injection analysis.", "abstract": "A novel system based on reverse flow injection analysis with a gaseous diffusion step (GD-r-FIA) has been developed for the analysis of ozone. It includes an automatic microburet injection system. The ozone diffuses through a microporous membrane of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) from the donor stream to the acceptor stream containing nitrite ions. The nitrite concentration in the acceptor solution decreases due to the ozone reduction reaction. In this way, a simple indirect measurement of the ozone concentration can be performed using the Griess-Ilosvay reaction for the nitrite ion. This correlates with the decrease in absorbance of the azoic dye formed with the ozone concentration in the donor stream. The system has been optimised by investigating the effect of the nitrite concentration in the acceptor stream on the diffusion flow. The optimum nitrite concentration was set at 0.250 ppm with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The efficiency of the ozone diffusion through the membrane was only 4.4%. This affects the average sensitivity, which is low (0.0092+/-0.0012 AU/ppm), although the detection limit is similar to that obtained with other reported methods (0.03 ppm). The main advantage of the system reported here is that it has a linear range that is an order of magnitude broader than those observed for other GD-FIA systems. This is especially useful for continuous monitoring systems, since the residual ozone concentration is normally between 0.05 and 5.0 ppm. Additionally, using the reverse flow injection analysis (FIA) technique minimises chemical consumption and residue generation. Finally, the stability of the ozone solution and the repeatability and reproducibility of the method have been studied.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2005-04-19", "authors": ["MBaeza", "JAlonso", "JBartrol\u00ed"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-005-3090-y"}

Both a pristine fullerene film and fullerene-palladium (C(60)-Pd) polymer film-modified platinum, glassy carbon and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes were used. The immobilized cyt c was characterized by piezoelectric microgravimetry at a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), UV-visible absorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The UV-visible spectral studies revealed a small blue shift of both the Soret and Q band of the heme moiety of cyt c, immobilized on the C(60)-Pd polymer film-modified ITO electrode, as compared to the bands of cyt c in solution suggesting that molecules of cyt c are densely packed onto the surface of the modified electrode. The CV studies revealed a quasi-reversible electrode behavior of the heme moiety indicating the occurrence of kinetically hindered electron transfer. A good agreement was found between the values of cyt c electrode surface coverage determined by piezoelectric microgravimetry and cyclic voltammetry. For piezoelectric microgravimetry, these values ranged from 0.5 x 10(-10) to 2.5 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2), depending upon the amount of cyt c present in solution and the time allowed for immobilization, which compared with a value of 3.6+/-0.4 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) determined by CV.

Proteins separated by classical two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis could be detected by scanning the membrane surface with a vibrating capacitor (also called a Kelvin probe) on the basis of differences between their surface potential and that of the membrane. Coupled to colloidal gold staining, the technique enables detection of proteins previously undetectable by classical staining methods. Plotting variations of the surface potential in two dimensions visualizes proteins which migrate close together. Finally, we demonstrate that the Kelvin probe detects proteins over a concentration range from micro to sub-nanogram with increased sensitivity at lower concentrations, and unlike other methods, appears to be similar for all proteins tested so far.

{"title": "MUC5B glycosylation in human saliva reflects blood group and secretor status.", "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize human salivary glycoforms and the natural glycosylation variation of the major ABO blood group bearing high molecular weight glycoprotein fraction MG1, which mainly consists of MUC5B mucin. Reduced and alkylated mucins from individuals of blood group A, B, and O were purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose/polyacrylamide composite gel electrophoresis (SDS-AgPAGE), blotted to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, and visualized with alcian blue. O-linked oligosaccharides were released from MUC5B glycoform bands by reductive beta-elimination and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry (MS). Slow electrophoretically migrating MUC5B components (sm) were found to be dominated by neutral oligosaccharides, and fast-migrating (fm) components were dominated by sulfated oligosaccharides. ABO blood group-specific sequences were found on all glycoforms, and novel oligosaccharides containing blood group A and B type sequences were sequenced. This is the first molecular description of the influence of the blood group ABO system on salivary MUC5B oligosaccharides. Expanding these results from the three A, B, and O individuals into larger population (29 individuals), we found oligosaccharide sequences corresponding to the blood group of the donor on MUC5B from 23 individuals. The remaining six individuals were characterized by a high degree of sialylation. These individuals were assigned as nonsecretors, whereas blood group-expressing individuals were assigned as secretors. Western blot assays with antibodies confirmed increased expression of Sialyl Lewis a (Si-Le(a)) in the nonsecretors. Our results highlight that salivary MUC5B consists of glycoforms with distinct glycosylation that vary extensively between individuals and that some of this variation is owing to blood group and secretor status.", "journal": "Glycobiology", "date": "2005-04-09", "authors": ["Kristina AThomsson", "Benjamin LSchulz", "Nicolle HPacker", "Niclas GKarlsson"], "doi": "10.1093/glycob/cwi059"}

Epidemiological and biomechanical models of injury causation were combined. Host, agent and environmental factors that influenced total available force for transfer to host were specified. Measurement instruments for each of the specified risk factors were developed. Instruments were piloted in a volunteer sample of surf lifesavers. Participant characteristics were recorded using demographic questionnaires; IRB operating techniques were recorded using a custom-made on-board camera (Grand RF-Guard) and images of operating techniques were coded by two independent observers. Ground reaction forces transmitted to the host through the lifesaver's feet at the time of wave impact were measured using a custom-built piezoelectric force platform. The demographic questionnaire was found practical; the on-board camera functioned successfully within the target environment. Agreement between independent coders of IRB operating technique images was significant (p < 0.001) with Kappa values ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Biomechanical instruments performed successfully in the target environment. Peak biomechanical forces were 415.6N (left foot) and 252.9N (right foot).

A detailed study was then carried out to examine the effects of operating conditions (such as solution pH, ionic strength, stirring speed, and permeate flux) on the separation of the monomer from the dimers using 300 kDa PES and 100 kDa PVDF membranes. Results of the experiments carried out in the carrier phase ultrafiltration (CPUF) mode indicate that the size-based protein-protein separation critically depends on the membrane used as well as the system hydrodynamics. The separation of the monoclonal antibody monomer and dimers using 100 kDa PVDF membranes in the diafiltration mode was also examined. Experimental results demonstrate that under suitable conditions, it is feasible to obtain the alemtuzumab monomer with a purity of more than 93% and a yield of more than 85% (from a mixture of 75% monomer and 25% dimers, which is the typical composition obtained after affinity chromatography).

Quantitative comparison with theory shows that the long range PZ coupling between holes and phonons has the expected magnitude; however, in the metallic state, the short range DP coupling between holes and phonons is almost 20 times stronger than expected from theory.

{"title": "[Ultrasound for peripheral neural block].", "abstract": "Ultrasound is well established in medicine. Unfortunately, ultrasound is still rarely used in the area of anesthesia. The purpose of the article is to illustrate the possibilities and limitations of ultrasound in regional anesthesia. The basic principles of ultrasound are the piezoelectric effect and the behaviour of acoustic waveforms in human tissue. Ultrasound imaging in medicine uses high frequency pulses of sound waves (2.5-10 MHz). The following images are built up from the reflected sounds. The ultrasound devices used in regional anesthesia (commonly by 10 MHz) deliver a two-dimensional view. The main step for a successful regional anaesthesia is to identify the exact position of the nerve. In addition, specific surface landmarks and the use of peripheral nerve stimulator help to detect the correct position of the needle. Nerves are demonstrated as an composition of hyperechogenic (white) and hypoechogenic (black) areas. The surrounding hyperechogenic parts are epi- and perineurium, the dark hypoechogenic part is the neural tissue. The composition of peripheral nerves are always similar, but the quantities of each part, of surrounding perineurium and nerval structures, differ. Further the imaging of nerves is significantly influenced by the angle of beam to the nerve and the surrounding anatomic structures. Only experience and correct interpretation make the ultrasound a valid method in clinical practice. Correct interpretation has to be learned by standardized education. Three examples of peripheral nerve blocks are described. The detection of nerves and the visualization of the correct spread of local anesthetics to the nerves are the main principles of effective ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, whereas closest proximity of the needle to the target nerve is not necessary. The described examples of ultrasound guidance for nerval block illustrates the specific procedures with reduced probability of nerval irritation, high success and low rate of complications.", "journal": "Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie : AINS", "date": "2005-03-17", "authors": ["FKefalianakis"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2004-826216"}

Oocytes were harvested, post mortem, from the ovaries of Japanese Black heifers or cows. ICSI was carried out using a piezo-electric actuator. The injected or sham-injected oocytes that were assigned to three activation treatments, each replicated three times, were studied: (1) exposure to 5 microM ionomycin for 5 min (ionomycin); (2) exposure to 5 microM ionomycin for 5 min followed by culture in TCM199 for 3 h and a further 3h culture in 1.9 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP-ionomycin+DMAP); (3) exposure to 7% ethanol in TCM199 for 5 min, 4 h after ICSI (ethanol). One or two blastocysts from the ionomycin+DMAP (8 recipients) and ethanol (17 recipients) oocyte activation treatments were non-surgically transferred into Holsteins for the study of calf production. The highest cleavage and blastocyst production rates were observed in the ionomycin+DMAP treatment (83.9% and 40.1%) by the ICSI. These rates were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those for the ionomycin oocyte activation treatment (57.6% and 18.2%) but did not differ from the ethanol treatment (75.6% and 29.4%). In the sham-injected, the highest blastocyst production rates were observed for the ionomycin+DMAP and ethanol treatments (10.7% and 11.3%). Pregnancy and birth rates for blastocysts derived from the ethanol oocyte activation treatment (58.8% and 47.4%) were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of the ionomycin+DMAP treatment (12.5% and 9.2%).

We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of a surface recognition device that discriminates dental surfaces by mathematical analysis of reflected ultrasound waves. This principle should enable the construction of calculus detecting ultrasonic device. Pre-clinical test results are presented here.\nAn impulse generator, coupled to a conventional piezo-driven ultrasonic scaler, sends signals to the cementum via the tip of an ultrasound device. The oscillation signal reflected from the surface contains the information necessary to analyse its characteristics. In order to discriminate different surfaces, learning sets were generated from 70 extracted teeth using standardized tip angle/lateral force combinations. The complete device was then used to classify root surfaces unknown to the system.\nAbout 80% of enamel and cementum was correctly identified in vivo (sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 82%).

First, the use of a high-resolution technique for the pixelwise detection of phase steps is proposed. Next, the robustness of the algorithm that is developed is improved by incorporation of a denoising procedure during spectral estimation. The pixelwise knowledge of phase steps is then applied to the Vandermonde system of equations for retrieval of phase values at each pixel point. Conceptually, our proposal involves the design of an annihilating filter that has zeros at the frequencies associated with the polynomial that describes the fringe intensity. The parametric estimation of this annihilating filter yields the desired spectral information embedded in the signal, which in our case represents the phase steps. The proposed method offers the advantage of extracting the interference phase of nonsinusoidal waveforms in the presence of miscalibration error of the piezoelectric transducer.

{"title": "Analysis of the sandwich piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer in coupled vibration.", "abstract": "The coupled vibration of the sandwich piezoelectric transducer with a large cross-section is analyzed using an approximate analytic method. The resonance frequency equations of the transducer are derived and the effect of the geometrical dimensions on the resonance frequency is studied. It is illustrated that when the radial vibration in the transducer is considered, the vibration of the sandwich transducer becomes more complex. Apart from the longitudinal resonance frequency, the radial resonance frequency can also be obtained. For comparison, numerical methods are also used to simulate the coupled vibration; the resonance frequency and the vibrational displacement distribution are computed. Compared with one-dimensional longitudinal theory, the radial dimensions of the transducer are no longer limited because the coupled vibration is considered. Compared with numerical methods, the physical meaning of the analytic method is concise. It is illustrated that the resonance frequencies obtained from the coupled resonance frequency equations are in good agreement with those from numerical methods, and they are in better agreement with the measured results than those from one-dimensional theory. Since the radial and the coupled vibration are considered in the analysis, more resonance frequencies can be obtained. Therefore, using the coupled resonance frequency equations, the sandwich transducer with multifrequency or wide frequency bandwidth can be designed and used in ultrasonic cleaning, ultrasonic sonochemistry and other applications.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2005-03-12", "authors": ["LinShuyu"], "doi": "10.1121/1.1849960"}
{"title": "Atomic force microscopy study of the interaction between adsorbed poly(ethylene oxide) layers: effects of surface modification and approach velocity.", "abstract": "The interaction forces between layers of the triblock copolymer Pluronic F108 adsorbed onto hydrophobic radio frequency glow discharge (RFGD) thin film surfaces and hydrophilic silica, in polymer-free 0.15 M NaCl solution, have been measured using the atomic force microscope (AFM) colloid probe technique. Compression of Pluronic F108 layers adsorbed on the hydrophobic RFGD surfaces results in a purely repulsive force due to the steric overlap of the layers, the form of which suggests that the PEO chains adopt a brush conformation. Subsequent fitting of these data to the polymer brush models of Alexander-de Gennes and Milner, Witten, and Cates confirms that the adsorbed Pluronic F108 adsorbs onto hydrophobic surfaces as a polymer brush with a parabolic segment density profile. In comparison, the interaction between Pluronic F108 layers adsorbed on silica exhibits a long ranged shallow attractive force and a weaker steric repulsion. The attractive component is reasonably well described by van der Waals forces, but polymer bridging cannot be ruled out. The weaker steric component of the force suggests that the polymer is less densely packed on the surface and is less extended into solution, existing as polymeric isolated mushrooms. When the surfaces are driven together at high piezo ramp velocities, an additional repulsive force is measured, attributable to hydrodynamic drainage forces between the surfaces. In comparing theoretical predictions of the hydrodynamic force to the experimentally obtained data, agreement could only be obtained if the flow profile of the aqueous solution penetrated significantly into the polymer brush. This finding is in line with the theoretical predictions of Milner and provides further evidence that the segment density profile of the adsorbed polymer brush is parabolic. A velocity dependent additional stepped repulsive force, reminiscent of a solvation oscillatory force, is also observed when the adsorbed layers are compressed under high loads. This additional force is presumably a result of hindered drainage of water due to the presence of a high volume fraction of polymer chains between the surfaces.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2005-03-09", "authors": ["Scott CMcLean", "HadiLioe", "LaurenceMeagher", "Vincent S JCraig", "Michelle LGee"], "doi": "10.1021/la047942s"}

For the fabrication of our nanomechanical PZT cantilevers, we used composite layers of Ta/Pt/PZT/Pt/SiO2 on a SiN(x) supporting layer for electrical self-sensing without external oscillators. This method allows PSA proteins to be detected via a simple electrical measurement of the resonant frequency change generated by the molecular interaction of the antigen (Ag) and the antibody (Ab). The resonant frequency shifted due to the specific binding of the PSA Ag to its Ab which is immobilized via calixcrown self-assembled monolayers on an Au surface deposited on a nanomechanical PZT cantilever. We determined the resonant frequency shift as the value of -172 Hz and -273 Hz, when the concentration of PSA Ag was 1 ng/ml, with the cantilever dimensions of 100 microm x 300 microm and 50 microm x 150 microm, respectively. Theoretical and experimental analysis suggests that the minimum detectable sensitivity for a resonant frequency shift due to a PSA Ag-Ab interaction depends on the dimensions of the nanomechanical PZT cantilever.

Binding of both OPG standard and recombinant OPGFc chimeric protein was followed in real time. All antibodies were able to bind OPG and OPGFc, though in the case of MAb 4E6H9 the immunocomplexes dissociated quickly in the absence of OPG. Alternatively, biorecognition layers with RANKL were used. Two versions of the piezoelectric sensor for OPG were developed. The direct immunosensor was based on the antibody 5H3 and the affinity sensor employed the immobilised RANKL. The RANKL sensor exhibited poor reproducibility of results.

The channel currents were recorded under steady-state conditions using cell-attached single-channel patch clamp, and during transient exposures to the agonists using a piezo-driven fast application system. The presence of choline resulted in inhibition of currents elicited by carbachol. The inhibitory effect of choline manifested as a reduction in the effective opening rate (increase in the mean intracluster closed time duration) in single-channel recordings. In the fast application experiments, the peak current amplitude was reduced and the current rise time increased when choline was co-applied with carbachol. The data were analysed according to a model in which receptor interactions with carbachol and choline resulted in three types of ligation: receptors occupied by two carbachol molecules, receptors occupied by two choline molecules, and receptors in which one agonist binding site was occupied by carbachol and the other by choline, i.e. heteroliganded receptors. All three agonist-bound receptor populations could open albeit with different efficacies. The affinity of the resting receptor to choline was estimated to be 1-2 mm, and heteroliganded receptors opened with an opening rate constant of approximately 3000 s(-1). The results of the analysis suggest that the presence of choline in the neuromuscular junction in vivo has little effect on the time course of synaptic currents. Nevertheless, the contribution of heteroliganded receptors should be taken into consideration when the receptor is exposed simultaneously to two or more agonists.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2005-02-19", "authors": ["GustavAkk", "Lorin SMilescu", "ManfredHeckmann"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2004.078535\n10.1113/jphysiol.2002.029413\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0702941\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.t01-2-00405.x\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4985-04.2005\n10.1085/jgp.112.2.181\n10.1124/jpet.102.035899"}
{"title": "Proteins of calcified endoskeleton: II partial amino acid sequences of endoskeletal proteins and the characterization of proteinaceous organic matrix of spicules from the alcyonarian, Synularia polydactyla.", "abstract": "Calcified organic substances in the skeleton contain a protein-polysaccharide complex taking a key role in the regulation of bio-calcification. However, information concerning the matrix proteins in alcyonarian and their effect on calcification process is still unknown. For this reason, we have studied the organic matrix of endoskeletal spicules from the alcyonarian coral, Synularia polydactyla, to analyze the proteins with their sequences and investigate the functional properties by a molecular approach. The separated spicules from the colony were identified by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The soluble organic matrix comprised 0.04% of spicule weight. By recording decline of pH in the experimental design, the inhibitory effect of the matrix on CaCO3 precipitation was revealed. Prior to electrophoresis, our analysis of proteins extracted from the soluble organic matrix of the spicules revealed an abundance of proteins in molecular weight. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of the preparations showed seven bands of proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 109, 83, 70, 63, 41, 30 and 22 kDa. The proteins were electrophoresed on Tricine-SDS-PAGE after electro-elution treatment, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and their N-termini were sequenced. Two bands of proteins of about 70 and 63 kDa successfully underwent N-terminal amino acid sequencing. For the detection of calcium binding proteins, a Ca2+ overlay analysis was conducted on the extract by 45Ca autoradiography. The 109 and 63 kDa calcium binding proteins were found to be radioactive. Periodic acid schiff staining indicated that 83 and 63 kDa proteins were glycosylated. An assay for carbonic anhydrase, which is thought to play an important role in the process of calcification revealed low level of the activity. These findings suggest that the endoskeletal spicules of alcyonarian corals have protein-rich organic matrices, which might be related to the calcification process.", "journal": "Proteomics", "date": "2005-02-16", "authors": ["M AzizurRahman", "YeishinIsa", "TsuyoshiUehara"], "doi": "10.1002/pmic.200401130"}

The ability to analyze LC20 phosphorylation in minute samples is critical to determine the importance of LC20 phosphorylation in diverse physiological processes. We have developed a method for the separation and quantification of unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated LC20 with a detection limit of 1 pg (50 amol). LC20 is initially isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transblotted to a polyvinlyidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The region of the membrane containing the LC20 band (identified by electrophoresis of purified LC20 in a neighboring lane) is cut out and fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide. The labeled LC20 is eluted from the membrane with detergent and subjected to capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) to separate unphosphorylated, mono-, and diphosphorylated LC20, which are detected and quantified by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). A linear relationship between log(peak area) and log(LC20 amount) is observed over the range of 50 amol-150 fmol. Quantification of LC20 phosphorylation by CIEF with LIF detection was compared with three commonly used methods with much lower levels of sensitivity: urea/glycerol-PAGE with Western blotting, phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP with Cerenkov counting, and phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP followed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and scanning densitometry. All four methods gave very similar quantitative results, the major difference being that the new method exhibits 3000-fold enhanced sensitivity.

Second, the probability of the magnitude of random error belonging to each of these classes is computed based on the density of the data set within the class. Based on these probabilities, the most probable systematic part of the error measurement can be statistically deduced. Finally, the geometrical error compensation is carried out based on this value.

Their specific interaction with model mucin was determined by pig mucin (PM) immobilized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor and in vitro adsorption studies. The hypoglycemic effects of alginate and WGA-conjugated alginate microparticles were examined after oral administration in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The alginate microparticles were fabricated by ejecting alginate/insulin solution into 0.1 M CaCl2 solution through a nozzle actuated by the piezoelectric transducer. The WGA was conjugated to alginate microparticles by activating hydroxyl groups with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). The affinity constant (K(A)) of alginate-WGA microparticles from the SPR data (K(A)=5.455 g(-1) L) was about nine times greater than alginate microparticles (K(A)=0.628 g(-1) L). In vitro experiments in the mucin solution showed that the conjugated WGA enhanced the interaction about three times. In vivo studies with diabetic rats showed that the blood glucose level of SPF rats was lowest when alginate-WGA microparticles were orally administered. Larger K(A) of alginate-WGA microparticles resulted in larger glucose change (%) from base level. Still, it is not clear whether the transport of insulin through the intestinal mucous membrane was influenced by the increase of residence time at intestinal membrane through the specific adsorption of WGA-conjugated microparticles.

Surface analysis reveals that the linker protein for biotinylated moieties, neutravidin, is both readily chemisorbed to bare gallium phosphate at pH 7.5 and attached to p-hydroxy benzaldehyde-treated devices, establishing the possibility to exploit the surface chemistry of the phosphate for the fabrication of an electrode-free acoustic wave biosensor.

The radius of the orbits is half of the x,y-width of the point spread function, and the distance between the z planes is the z-width of the point spread function. The z-position is adjusted by moving the objective with a piezoelectric-nanopositioner.

Presently, physiotherapists judge the condition of the sacroiliac joints by function and provocation tests, and palpation. No objective measuring device is available. Research is ongoing to identify the biomechanical properties of the sacroiliac joints from the dynamic behaviour of the pelvic bones. A new concept based on ultrasound (US) for the measurement of bone vibration is under investigation. The objective of this study was to validate this concept on a physical model and to assess the applicability in vivo. A model consisting of a piezo shaker covered by a layer of US transmission gel (representing bone and soft tissue) has been used. A packet of US detection signals is directed onto the shaker and correlation-based processing is used to estimate the difference in time-of-flight of their echoes. These variations of time are used to compute the displacement of the shaker at each pulse reflection. To assess the validity of our US technique, we compared the obtained measurements with the readings of the built-in strain gauge sensor. The experimental procedure has been tested on a volunteer where low-frequency excitation was provided through the ilium and vibration detected on the sacrum and ilia. The results demonstrated that the correlation-based approach is capable of reproducing the piezo shaker displacements with high accuracy (+/- 7%). Vibration amplitudes from 0.25 microm to 3 microm could be measured. The US technique was able to detect bone vibration in vivo.

This study showed how membrane filtration using a syringe filter is able to concentrate L. monocytogenes by 95x with up to 95% recovery of living microorganisms by concentrating 50 mL of food sample into a volume of 500 microL. Tween 20 was added to the sample to prevent irreversible adsorption of the microorganism to the membrane and thereby help to ensure high recovery. Comparison of polycarbonate, mixed cellulose, nylon, and PVDF membranes with 0.2 to 0.45 microm pores showed the 0.2 microm polycarbonate membrane with straight through, mono-radial pores gives the highest recovery of living microorganisms. The mixed cellulose, nylon, and PVDF membranes have a fibrous structure whose characteristic openings are much larger than their effective pore size cut-offs of 0.22 or 0.45 microm. We define conditions for rapid membrane-based cell concentration and recovery that has the potential to supplant enrichment steps that require a day or more. This approach has the added benefit of facilitating examination of a large amount of fluid volume by reducing its volume to a range that is compatible with the microliter scales of biochip or other biosensor detection systems.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2004-12-23", "authors": ["Wan-TzuChen", "Richard LHendrickson", "Chia-PingHuang", "DebSherman", "TaoGeng", "Arun KBhunia", "Michael RLadisch"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.20256"}
{"title": "Evidence of piezoelectric resonance in isolated outer hair cells.", "abstract": "Our results demonstrate high-frequency electrical resonances in outer hair cells (OHCs) exhibiting features analogous to classical piezoelectric transducers. The fundamental (first) resonance frequency averaged f(n) approximately 13 kHz (Q approximately 1.7). Higher-order resonances were also observed. To obtain these results, OHCs were positioned in a custom microchamber and subjected to stimulating electric fields along the axis of the cell (1-100 kHz, 4-16 mV/80 microm). Electrodes embedded in the side walls of the microchamber were used in a voltage-divider configuration to estimate the electrical admittance of the top portion of the cell-loaded chamber (containing the electromotile lateral wall) relative to the lower portion (containing the basal plasma membrane). This ratio exhibited resonance-like electrical tuning. Resonance was also detected independently using a secondary 1-MHz radio-frequency interrogation signal applied transversely across the cell diameter. The radio-frequency interrogation revealed changes in the transverse electric impedance modulated by the axial stimulus. Modulation of the transverse electric impedance was particularly pronounced near the resonant frequencies. OHCs used in our study were isolated from the apical region of the guinea pig cochlea, a region that responds exclusively to low-frequency acoustic stimuli. In this sense, electrical resonances we observed in vitro were at least an order of magnitude higher (ultrasonic) than the best physiological frequency of the same OHCs under acoustic stimuli in vivo. These resonance data further support the piezoelectric theory of OHC function, and implicate piezoelectricity in the broad-band electromechanical behavior of OHCs underlying mammalian cochlear function.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2004-12-23", "authors": ["R DRabbitt", "H EAyliffe", "DChristensen", "KPamarthy", "CDurney", "SClifford", "W EBrownell"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.104.050872"}

The microbeads of approximately spherical shape and narrow size distribution were prepared from a mixture of poly (4-vinyl pyridine) (P4VP) and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) by a phase inversion technique and subsequently derivatized with alkyl bromides having 4-10 carbon atoms. The quaternization of the pyridine groups into pyridinium groups confers the surface with highly effective and long-lasting antibacterial and antifungal properties, as shown by the effect on Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger. Upon contact with the N-alkylated beads, the bacteria and fungal spores are lysed and intracellular constituents leach out into the medium. The efficacy of the alkyl chains in disrupting the cell membrane was investigated. The stability of the functional group and microbiocidal effectiveness of the microbeads in repeated applications was also assessed.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2004-12-21", "authors": ["F XHu", "K GNeoh", "LCen", "E TKang"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.20384"}
{"title": "Latex bead immobilisation in PDMS matrix for the detection of p53 gene point mutation and anti-HIV-1 capsid protein antibodies.", "abstract": "Two diagnostic chemiluminescent biochips were developed for either the detection of p53 gene point mutation or the serological detection of anti-HIV-1 p24 capsid protein. Both biochips were composed of 24 microarrays of latex beads spots (4x4) (150 microm in diameter, 800 microm spacing) entrapped in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer (PDMS). The latex beads, bearing oligonucleotide sequences or capsid protein, were spotted with a conventional piezoelectric spotter and subsequently transferred at the PDMS interface. The electron microscopy observation of the biochips showed how homogeneous and well distributed the spots could be. Point mutation detection on the codon 273 of the p53 gene was performed on the basis of the melting temperature difference between the perfect match sequence and the one base pair mismatch sequence. The hybridisation of a 20-mer oligonucleotide form the codon 273 including a one base pair mutation in its sequence on a biochip arrayed with non-muted and the muted complementary sequences, enabled a clear discrimination at 56 degrees C between muted and wild sequences. Moreover, the quantitative measurement of the amount of muted sequence in a sample was possible in the range 0.4-4 pmol. Serological measurement of anti-HIV-1 p24 capsid protein on the biochip, prepared with 1-microm-diameter latex beads, enabled the detection of monoclonal antibodies in the range 1.55-775 ng mL(-1). Such a range could be lowered to 0.775 ng mL(-1) when using 50-nm-diameter beads, which generated a higher specific surface. The validation of the biochip for the detection of anti-HIV-1 capsid protein antibodies was performed in human sera from seropositive and seronegative patients. The positivity of the sera was easily discriminated at serum dilutions below 1:1,000.", "journal": "Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry", "date": "2004-12-16", "authors": ["Christophe AMarquette", "Agn\u00e8sDegiuli", "EmmanuelleImbert-Laurenceau", "FrancoisMallet", "CaroleChaix", "BernardMandrand", "Lo\u00efc JBlum"], "doi": "10.1007/s00216-004-2862-0"}

For targeting and detecting the protein, rho-tag import sequence was fused with the I7 protein. The olfactory receptor was expressed on the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells, and stable cell lines regulated by an inducer were obtained. The expression on the cell surface was confirmed by immunocytochemical and Western blotting methods, and the binding of specific odorant molecules to the olfactory receptor was measured using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The results for QCM coated with cells containing the olfactory receptor showed that the expressed protein I7 strongly interacted with octyl aldehyde (octanal), which is an odorant specific to the I7 protein. Several other odorants were tested, and the results showed that I7 interacted differently with them. The QCM response to the serial concentrations of octyl aldehyde showed that the response is dose dependent. All these results indicate that the I7 receptor protein expressed on the surface of the heterologous cell system is sensitive to the specific odorant and can be used for the quantitative measurement of the odorant.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["Hwi JinKo", "Tai HyunPark"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bios.2004.05.002"}
{"title": "Planar coil excitation of multifrequency shear wave transducers.", "abstract": "A transducer format that replaces the electrode of an acoustic resonator with a planar spiral coil is used to extract multifrequency spectral information from adsorbed protein films. Both amorphous silica and crystalline piezoelectric resonators are driven to resonance by forces induced across an air gap by magnetic direct generation and piezoelectric excitation induced by the electromagnetic field of the coil. Inspection of the harmonic frequencies between 6 MHz and 0.6 GHz indicates that the response of these two resonator types is described by different families of shear acoustic standing waves, with similar acoustic features to the quartz crystal microbalance. Exposure of the devices to protein solutions results in reproducible shifts of their harmonic frequencies, up to a maximum of 15 kHz and increasing linearly with frequency and operating mode. The gradient, determined from the ratio of the frequency change to the operating frequency was determined as 21.5 x 10(-6) for the quartz device and 60.9 x 10(-6) for the silica device. Consistency with the Sauerbrey equation for the piezoelectric linear shear mode was comparable at a predicted value of 22.5 x 10(-6), but not for the radial shear mode of the silica device at 12.7 x 10(-6).

{"title": "Development of a novel compact sonicator for cell disruption.", "abstract": "Ultrasound microbial cell disrupters operating at around 20 kHz are often physically large and, due to significant heating, can be unsuitable for small sample volumes where biochemical integrity of the extracted product is required. Development of a compact device based on a 63.5-mm diameter, 6.5-mm thick tubular transducer for rapid cell disruption in small-volume samples in a high-intensity acoustic cavitation field with minimal temperature rises is described here. Suspensions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were exposed to cavitation for various times in the compact device and a 20-kHz probe sonicator. Cell disruption was assessed by protein release and by staining. Yeast cell disruption was greater in the novel 267-kHz sonicator than in the 20-kHz probe sonicator for the same exposure time. A 1-dimensional (1-D) transfer matrix model analysis for piezoelectric resonators was applied to an axial cross-section of the tubular sonicator to predict frequencies of mechanical resonance in the sample volume associated with maximum acoustic pressure. Admittance measurements identified frequencies of electrical resonance. Ultrasonic cavitation noise peaks were detected by a hydrophone at both the mechanical and electrical resonances. Cell breakage efficiency was twice as great in terms of protein released per dissipated watt at the mechanical resonance predicted by the model, compared to those at the electrical resonance frequencies. The results form a basis for rational design of an ultrasound cell disruption technique for small-volume samples.", "journal": "Journal of microbiological methods", "date": "2004-12-14", "authors": ["K A JBorthwick", "W TCoakley", "M BMcDonnell", "HNowotny", "EBenes", "MGr\u00f6schl"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mimet.2004.09.012"}

The viscoelasticity of the film in the air and in buffer solution has been studied by the piezoelectric quartz crystal impedance technique. The binding of L-histidine to the imprinted film in the liquid phase was investigated by the piezoelectric microgravimetry and electrochemical impedance technique.

The adsorption of gelatin on a quartz crystal surface corresponds to a mass increase, which can be monitored in real time by the changes in the impedance parameters of the ESPS. It was shown that the adsorption of gelatin on a quartz surface is partly irreversible with respect to the dilution of the bulk phase. The observed adsorption kinetics is compatible with a mechanism that involves adsorption, desorption, and transformation from a reversible adsorption state to irreversible one. A progressive approach method was established to simulate the adsorption process.

It is shown that PEO has much stronger ability of solvation to NaSCN than PVdF does, indicating that the polymeric donor number is more important than its dielectric constant in solvating effect of polymer. However, PVdF can keep its semicrystalline nature and form microporous structure in blend-based electrolytes. These characters make PVdF not only enhance the mechanical stability of the electrolyte thin films, but also transform PEO crystalline phase into fully amorphous phase. Although PVdF can effectively disrupt the crystalline complex P(EO)(3)NaSCN, it does not affect the component of triple aggregations.

{"title": "Differential effects on current kinetics by point mutations in the lurcher motif of NR1/NR2A receptors.", "abstract": "The extracellular proton site has emerged as the key site in regulating N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. However, the molecular determinants for the proton-sensitive gating of NMDA receptors are still not clearly delineated. The highly conserved lurcher motif plays an important role in determining the proton sensitivity of NMDA receptors. Mutations of several residues in the lurcher motif of either NR1 or NR2A significantly reduce proton sensitivity of recombinant NR1/NR2A receptors. It remains uncertain how these residues play a role in proton inhibition of NMDA receptors. Mutations of these residues could directly reduce the proton affinity. Alternatively, they could alter the proton IC(50) indirectly by increasing channel open probability. In the present study, we recorded the macroscopic NMDA currents in HEK 293 cells with a piezo-based rapid solution exchange system. We show that zinc slows the deactivation of NR1a(A653T)/NR2A receptors and NR1a/NR2A(A651T) receptors. However, NR1a(T648C)/NR2A, NR1a/NR2A(T646C), NR1a(A649C)/NR2A, NR1a/NR2A(A647C), and NR1a(A653T)/NR2A exhibit significantly slower rise time and deactivation time constants under nominally zinc-free conditions. Our data suggest that the channel open probability for these mutant receptors may be significantly increased. The reduction in proton sensitivity by these mutations could be accounted for, at least partially, by the increased channel open probability. In contrast, NR1a/NR2A(A651T) exhibits normal macroscopic currents, suggesting that the reduction of proton sensitivity by this mutation cannot be attributed to any significant change of open probability. Further experiments are needed to determine the exact role of this residue in proton-sensitive gating of NMDA receptors.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2004-10-27", "authors": ["BoHu", "FangZheng"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.104.077388"}
{"title": "Abnormal cardiac wall motion and early matrix metalloproteinase activity.", "abstract": "Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the heart is known to facilitate cardiac remodeling and progression to failure. We hypothesized that regional dyskinetic wall motion of the left ventricle would stimulate activation of MMPs. Abnormal wall motion at a target site on the anterior lateral wall of the left ventricle was induced by pacing atrial and ventricular sites of five open-chest anesthetized dogs. Changes in shortening at the left ventricular (LV) pacing site and at a remote site at the anterior base of the left ventricle were monitored with piezoelectric crystals. Simultaneous atrial and ventricular pacing resulted in abnormal motion at the LV pacing site, yielding early shortening and late systolic lengthening, whereas the shortening pattern at the remote site remained unaffected. Assessment of global myocardial MMP activity showed a sevenfold increase in substrate cleavage (P < 0.02) at the LV pacing site relative to the remote site. Gelatin zymography revealed increases in 92-kDa MMP-9 activity and 86-kDa MMP-9 activity at the LV pacing site relative to the remote site, whereas MMP-2 activity was unaffected. Abnormal wall motion was associated with increases in collagen degradation (approximately 2-fold; P < 0.03), plasmin activity (approximately 1.5-fold; P < 0.05), nitrotyrosine levels (approximately 20-fold; P = 0.05), and inflammatory infiltrate (approximately 2-fold; P < 0.02) relative to the remote site.

{"title": "Measurement of meniscofemoral contact pressure after repair of bucket-handle tears with biodegradable implants.", "abstract": "Biodegradable implants are frequently used for meniscus repair. Articular cartilage damage has been reported recently after meniscus repair with biodegradable implants. The aim of the study was to investigate the meniscofemoral contact pressure at the posterior horn of the medial and lateral meniscus after repair of bucket-handle lacerations.\nSpecimens were mounted in a materials testing machine (Bionix 858, MTS) which was equipped with a load cell. The quadriceps tendon was attached to a hydraulic cylinder, and knee motion was controlled via tension of the quadriceps tendon. A piezo-resistive system (Tekscan, Boston, MA, USA) measured the meniscofemoral contact pressure. Five different types of biodegradable implants (Arrow, Dart, Fastener, Stinger and Meniscal Screw) and horizontal suture (no. 2 Ethibond) were tested. The knee was extended from 90 degrees of flexion to 0 degrees under a constant load of 350 N due to adjustment of the tension force of the quadriceps tendon. The femorotibial pressure and contact area were recorded at 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion.\nThe meniscofemoral pressure did not increase after meniscus repair with biodegradable implants or sutures. The meniscofemoral peak pressure at the posterior horn was 1.46+/-1.54 MPa in the medial compartment and 1.08+/-1.17 MPa in the lateral compartment at full knee extension. The meniscofemoral pressure increased significantly in both compartments with knee flexion from 0 degree to 90 degrees.\nBiodegradable implants for meniscus repair do not affect the meniscofemoral pressure. However, there remains a risk of damage to the cartilage when barbed implants are used. If the implant is not entirely advanced into the meniscus, the sharp head or some of the barbs at the column of the implant may come into direct contact with the articular cartilage of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau.
