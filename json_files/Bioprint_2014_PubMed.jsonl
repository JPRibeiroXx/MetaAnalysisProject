{"title": "Additive Manufacturing of Anatomical Models from Computed Tomography Scan Data.", "abstract": "The purpose of the study presented here was to investigate the manufacturability of human anatomical models from Computed Tomography (CT) scan data via a 3D desktop printer which uses fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology. First, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) CT scan data were converted to 3D Standard Triangle Language (STL) format by using In Vaselius digital imaging program. Once this STL file is obtained, a 3D physical version of the anatomical model can be fabricated by a desktop 3D FDM printer. As a case study, a patient's skull CT scan data was considered, and a tangible version of the skull was manufactured by a 3D FDM desktop printer. During the 3D printing process, the skull was built using acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) co-polymer plastic. The printed model showed that the 3D FDM printing technology is able to fabricate anatomical models with high accuracy. As a result, the skull model can be used for preoperative surgical planning, medical training activities, implant design and simulation to show the potential of the FDM technology in medical field. It will also improve communication between medical stuff and patients. Current result indicates that a 3D desktop printer which uses FDM technology can be used to obtain accurate anatomical models.", "journal": "Molecular & cellular biomechanics : MCB", "date": "2015-09-05", "authors": ["YG\u00fcr"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Bone tissue regeneration: the role of scaffold geometry.", "abstract": "The geometry of porous scaffolds that are used for bone tissue engineering and/or bone substitution has recently been shown to significantly influence the cellular response and the rate of bone tissue regeneration. Most importantly, it has been shown that the rate of tissue generation increases with curvature and is much larger on concave surfaces as compared to convex and planar surfaces. In this work, recent discoveries concerning the effects of geometrical features of porous scaffolds such as surface curvature, pore shape, and pore size on the cellular response and bone tissue regeneration process are reviewed. In addition to reviewing the recent experimental observations, we discuss the mechanisms through which geometry affects the bone tissue regeneration process. Of particular interest are the theoretical models that have been developed to explain the role of geometry in the bone tissue regeneration process. We then follow with a section on the implications of the observed phenomena for geometrical design of porous scaffolds including the application of predictive computational models in geometrical design of porous scaffolds. Moreover, some geometrical concepts in the design of porous scaffolds such as minimal surfaces and porous structures with geometrical gradients that have not been explored before are suggested for future studies. We especially focus on the porous scaffolds manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques where the geometry of the porous scaffolds could be precisely controlled. The paper concludes with a general discussion of the current state-of-the-art and recommendations for future research.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2015-07-29", "authors": ["Amir AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1039/c4bm00291a"}

{"title": "Rapid Reconstitution Packages (RRPs) implemented by integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and 3D printed microfluidics.", "abstract": "Rapid Reconstitution Packages (RRPs) are portable platforms that integrate microfluidics for rapid reconstitution of lyophilized drugs. Rapid reconstitution of lyophilized drugs using standard vials and syringes is an error-prone process. RRPs were designed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques to optimize fluidic structures for rapid mixing and integrating physical properties of targeted drugs and diluents. Devices were manufactured using stereo lithography 3D printing for micrometer structural precision and rapid prototyping. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was selected as the initial model drug to test the RRPs as it is unstable in solution. tPA is a thrombolytic drug, stored in lyophilized form, required in emergency settings for which rapid reconstitution is of critical importance. RRP performance and drug stability were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to characterize release kinetics. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed to test for drug activity after the RRPs were exposed to various controlled temperature conditions. Experimental results showed that RRPs provided effective reconstitution of tPA that strongly correlated with CFD results. Simulation and experimental results show that release kinetics can be adjusted by tuning the device structural dimensions and diluent drug physical parameters. The design of RRPs can be tailored for a number of applications by taking into account physical parameters of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), excipients, and diluents. RRPs are portable platforms that can be utilized for reconstitution of emergency drugs in time-critical therapies.", "journal": "Drug delivery and translational research", "date": "2015-03-20", "authors": ["AlbertChi", "SebastianCuri", "KevinClayton", "DavidLuciano", "KameronKlauber", "AlfredoAlexander-Katz", "SebastianD'hers", "Noel MElman"], "doi": "10.1007/s13346-014-0198-7"}
{"title": "Tenogenic Induction of Human MSCs by Anisotropically Aligned Collagen Biotextiles.", "abstract": "A novel biofabrication modality, electrophoretic compaction with macromolecular alignment, was utilized to make collagen threads that mimic the native tendon's structure and mechanical properties. A device with kinematic electrodes was designed to fabricate collagen threads in continuous length. For the first time, a 3D-biotextile was woven purely from collagen. Mechanical properties and load-displacement behavior of the biotextile mimicked those of the native tendon while presenting a porosity of 80%. The open pore network facilitated cell seeding across the continuum of the bioscaffold. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded in the woven scaffold underwent tenogenic differentiation in the absence of growth factors and synthesized a matrix that was positive for tenomodulin, COMP and type I collagen. Up-regulation of tenomodulin, a tendon specific marker, was 11.6 \u00b1 3.5 fold, COMP was up-regulated 16.7 \u00b1 5.5 fold, and Col I was up-regulated 6.9 \u00b1 2.7 fold greater on ELAC threads when compared to randomly oriented collagen gels. These results demonstrate that a bioscaffold woven by using collagen threads with densely compacted and anisotropically aligned substrate texture stimulates tenogenesis topographically, rendering the electrochemically aligned collagen as a promising candidate for functional repair of tendons and ligaments.", "journal": "Advanced functional materials", "date": "2015-03-10", "authors": ["MousaYounesi", "AnowarulIslam", "VipuilKishore", "James MAnderson", "OzanAkkus"], "doi": "10.1002/adfm.201400828"}

However, beyond the two-dimensional domain, there is a fourth group of elements - volumetric elements - which mapmakers do not take sufficiently into account when it comes to designing tactile maps and symbols. This study analyses the effect of including volumetric, or 3D, symbols within a tactile map. In order to do so, the researchers compared two tactile maps. One of them uses only two-dimensional elements and is produced using thermoforming, one of the most popular systems in this field, while the other includes volumetric symbols, thus highlighting the possibilities opened up by 3D printing, a new area of production.

{"title": "Relationship between unit cell type and porosity and the fatigue behavior of selective laser melted meta-biomaterials.", "abstract": "Meta-materials are structures when their small-scale properties are considered, but behave as materials when their homogenized macroscopic properties are studied. There is an intimate relationship between the design of the small-scale structure and the homogenized properties of such materials. In this article, we studied that relationship for meta-biomaterials that are aimed for biomedical applications, otherwise known as meta-biomaterials. Selective laser melted porous titanium (Ti6Al4V ELI) structures were manufactured based on three different types of repeating unit cells, namely cube, diamond, and truncated cuboctahedron, and with different porosities. The morphological features, static mechanical properties, and fatigue behavior of the porous biomaterials were studied with a focus on their fatigue behavior. It was observed that, in addition to static mechanical properties, the fatigue properties of the porous biomaterials are highly dependent on the type of unit cell as well as on porosity. None of the porous structures based on the cube unit cell failed after 10(6) loading cycles even when the applied stress reached 80% of their yield strengths. For both other unit cells, higher porosities resulted in shorter fatigue lives for the same level of applied stress. When normalized with respect to their yield stresses, the S-N data points of structures with different porosities very well (R(2)>0.8) conformed to one single power law specific to the type of the unit cell. For the same level of normalized applied stress, the truncated cuboctahedron unit cell resulted in a longer fatigue life as compared to the diamond unit cell. In a similar comparison, the fatigue lives of the porous structures based on both truncated cuboctahedron and diamond unit cells were longer than that of the porous structures based on the rhombic dodecahedron unit cell (determined in a previous study). The data presented in this study could serve as a basis for design of porous biomaterials as well as for corroboration of relevant analytical and computational models.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2015-01-13", "authors": ["SAmin Yavari", "S MAhmadi", "RWauthle", "BPouran", "JSchrooten", "HWeinans", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.12.015"}

Although a wide array of cell aggregation techniques has been investigated, and gained noticeable success, the application of tissue spheroids for scale-up tissue fabrication is still worth investigation. In this paper, we introduce a new micro-fabrication technique to create tissue strands at the scale of 500-700\u03bcm as a \"bioink\" for future robotic tissue printing. Printable alginate micro-conduits are used as semi-permeable capsules for tissue strand fabrication. Mouse insulinoma beta TC3 cell tissue strands were formed upon 4 days post fabrication with reasonable mechanical strength, high cell viability close to 90%, and tissue specific markers expression. Fusion was readily observed between strands when placing them together as early as 24h. Also, tissue strands were deposited with human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs) vascular conduits together to fabricated miniature pancreatic tissue analog. Our study provided a novel technique using tissue strands as \"bioink\" for scale-up bioprinting of tissues or organs.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Three-dimensional printing-based electro-millifluidic devices for fabricating multi-compartment particles.", "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate the use of stereolithographic 3D printing to fabricate millifluidic devices, which are used to engineer particles with multiple compartments. As the 3D design is directly transferred to the actual prototype, this method accommodates 3D millimeter-scaled features that are difficult to achieve by either lithographic-based microfabrication or traditional macrofabrication techniques. We exploit this approach to produce millifluidic networks to deliver multiple fluidic components. By taking advantage of the laminar flow, the fluidic components can form liquid jets with distinct patterns, and each pattern has clear boundaries between the liquid phases. Afterwards, droplets with controlled size are fabricated by spraying the liquid jet in an electric field, and subsequently converted to particles after a solidification step. As a demonstration, we fabricate calcium alginate particles with structures of (1) slice-by-slice multiple lamellae, (2) concentric core-shells, and (3) petals surrounding the particle centers. Furthermore, distinct hybrid particles combining two or more of the above structures are also obtained. These compartmentalized particles impart spatially dependent functionalities and properties. To show their applicability, various ingredients, including fruit juices, drugs, and magnetic nanoparticles are encapsulated in the different compartments as proof-of-concepts for applications, including food, drug delivery, and bioassays. Our 3D printed electro-millifluidic approach represents a convenient and robust method to extend the range of structures of functional particles.", "journal": "Biomicrofluidics", "date": "2015-01-02", "authors": ["Qiu LanChen", "ZhouLiu", "Ho CheungShum"], "doi": "10.1063/1.4902929\n10.2174/1381612811319350007\n10.1039/c0cs00216j\n10.1002/adma.201102560\n10.1021/bm060680j\n10.4291/wjgp.v3.i1.19\n10.1557/mrs.2014.10\n10.1002/adma.200803386\n10.1021/la403220p\n10.1038/nprot.2011.400\n10.1016/j.cocis.2007.09.003\n10.1039/c1lc20545e\n10.1021/la300915p\n10.1021/am402028w\n10.1021/ar4001263\n10.1002/adma.200900499\n10.1002/anie.201006023\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.022\n10.1021/la304058j\n10.1039/c3sm51176f\n10.1039/c3lc50678a\n10.1021/ja060882n\n10.1002/smll.200801855\n10.1039/b906819h\n10.1002/smll.200800591\n10.1002/smll.201002002\n10.1586/erd.12.58\n10.1007/s10856-008-3436-z\n10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2227950\n10.1021/la060759+\n10.1063/1.4817769\n10.1038/nmat1486\n10.1021/ja060836n\n10.1039/c3lc50956g\n10.1039/c2lc40761b\n10.1021/ac4041857\n10.1039/c4lc00171k\n10.1039/c3lc51360b\n10.1002/smll.201300975\n10.1039/C4RA05072J\n10.1063/1.4902929\n10.1039/c3lc51176f\n10.1016/j.ijpharm.2003.10.033\n10.1002/apj.398\n10.1016/j.addr.2009.07.019\n10.1016/j.polymer.2008.01.027\n10.1016/S1359-0294(00)00046-7\n10.1002/anie.200700581\n10.1021/jp404952x"}

We have previously shown that creating PNRs in a nanoparticle-film (NP-film) format enables the fabrication of an extremely large population of uniform PNRs with 100% yield using a self-assembly approach, which facilitates high-throughput PNR characterization using ensemble spectroscopic measurements and eliminates the need for expensive microscopy systems required by many other PNR platforms. We expand upon this prior work herein, showing that the NP-film PNR can be made compatible with aqueous sensing studies by adapting it for use in a transmission localized surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy format, where the coupled NP-film resonance responsible for the PNR signal is directly probed using an extinction measurement from a standard spectrophotometer. We designed slide holders that fit inside standard spectrophotometer cuvettes and position NP-film samples so that the coupled NP-film resonance can be detected in a collinear optical configuration. Once the NP-film PNR samples are cuvette-compatible, it is straightforward to calibrate the PNR in aqueous solution and use it to characterize dynamic, angstrom-scale distance changes resulting from pH-induced swelling of polyelectrolyte (PE) spacer layers as thin as 1 PE layer and also of a self-assembled monolayer of an amine-terminated alkanethiol. This development is an important step toward making PNR sensors more user-friendly and encouraging their widespread use in various sensing schemes.", "journal": "ACS photonics", "date": "2014-12-30", "authors": ["Ryan THill", "Klaudia MKozek", "AngusHucknall", "David RSmith", "AshutoshChilkoti"], "doi": "10.1021/ph500190q"}

Nine patients with a prominent mandibular angle were enrolled in this study. A pair of stereolithographic templates was fabricated by computer-aided image design and 3D printing.

The complex osseous anatomy between the occiput and the axis causes a high risk of injury to neurological and vascular structures, and it is important to have an accurate screw trajectory to guide anterior occiput-to-axis screw fixation. Thirty computed tomography (CT) scans of upper cervical spines were obtained for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Cylinders (1.75\u200amm radius) were drawn to simulate the trajectory of an anterior occiput-to-axis screw. The imitation screw was adjusted to 4 different angles and measured, as were the values of the maximized anteroposterior width and the left-right width of the occiput (C0) to the C1 and C1 to C2 joints. Then, the 3D models were printed, and an angle guide device was used to introduce the screws into the 3D models referring to the angles calculated from the 3D images. We found the screw angle ranged from \u03b11 (left: 4.99\u00b14.59\u00b0; right: 4.28\u00b15.45\u00b0) to \u03b12 (left: 20.22\u00b13.61\u00b0; right: 19.63\u00b14.94\u00b0); on the lateral view, the screw angle ranged from \u03b21 (left: 13.13\u00b14.93\u00b0; right: 11.82\u00b15.64\u00b0) to \u03b22 (left: 34.86\u00b16.00\u00b0; right: 35.01\u00b15.77\u00b0).

In this study, geometry and interface of bioprinted channels were investigated with micro-computed tomography and fluorescent imaging. In filament printing, size and shape of printed channels are influenced by their orientation, which was analyzed by printing horizontally and vertically aligned channels, and by the ink, which was evaluated by comparing channels printed with an alginate-gelatin hydrogel or with an emulsion. The influence of geometry and cell-embedding in the hydrogel on feature size and shape was investigated by printing more complex channels. The generation of hollow channels, induced through leaching of a support phase, was monitored over time. Horizontally aligned channels provided 16\u00d7 smaller cross-sectional areas than channels in vertical orientation. The smallest feature size of hydrogel filaments was twice as large compared to emulsion filaments. Feature size and shape depended on the geometry but did not alter when living cells were embedded.

This field is receiving increased attention from various manufacturing sectors including the medical devices sector. It is possible that advanced manufacturing techniques could replace the machining or casting of metal alloys in the manufacture of devices because of associated advantages that include design flexibility, reduced processing costs, reduced waste, and the opportunity to more easily manufacture complex or custom-shaped implants. The emerging advanced manufacturing approaches of metal injection moulding and additive layer manufacturing are receiving particular attention from the implant fabrication industry because they could overcome some of the difficulties associated with traditional implant fabrication techniques such as titanium casting. Using advanced manufacturing, it is also possible to produce more complex porous structures with improved mechanical performance, potentially matching the modulus of elasticity of local bone. While the economic and engineering potential of advanced manufacturing for the manufacture of musculo-skeletal implants is therefore clear, the impact on the biocompatibility of the materials has been less investigated.

In this study, fabrication of scaffolds by two-photon polymerization (2PP) of a biodegradable urethane and acrylate-based photoelastomer is demonstrated. This material supports 2PP processing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. The high photoreactivity of the biophotoelastomer permits 2PP processing at a scanning speed of 1000 mm s(-1), facilitating rapid fabrication of relatively large structures (>5 mm(3)). These structures are custom printed for in vitro assay screening in 96-well plates and are sufficiently flexible to enable facile handling and transplantation. These results indicate that stable scaffolds with porosities of greater than 60% can be produced using 2PP. Human bone marrow stromal cells grown on 3D scaffolds exhibit increased growth and proliferation compared to smooth 2D scaffold controls. 3D scaffolds adsorb larger amounts of protein than smooth 2D scaffolds due to their larger surface area; the scaffolds also allow cells to attach in multiple planes and to completely infiltrate the porous scaffolds.

In particular, PGS-PCL scaffolds with randomly oriented and highly aligned fibers with tunable mechanical properties were fabricated using electrospinning technique. After one week of culture, endothelial cells on the aligned scaffolds exhibited higher proliferation compared to those cultures on randomly oriented fibrous scaffolds. Furthermore, the endothelial cells reorganized in response to the topographical features of aligned scaffolds forming highly organized cellular constructs. Thus, topographical contact guidance, provided by aligned PGS-PCL scaffolds, is envisioned to be useful in developing cellular structures for vascular tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-12-18", "authors": ["Akhilesh KGaharwar", "MehdiNikkhah", "ShilpaSant", "AliKhademhosseini"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5090/7/1/015001"}
{"title": "Design of 3D printed insert for hanging culture of Caco-2 cells.", "abstract": "A Caco-2 cell culture on Transwell, an alternative testing to animal or human testing used in evaluating drug intestinal permeability, incorrectly estimated the absorption of actively transported drugs due to the low expression of membrane transporters. Similarly, three-dimensional (3D) cultures of Caco-2 cells, which have been recommended to be more physiological relevant, were not superior to the Transwell culture in either accuracy or convenience in drug permeability testing. Using rapid 3D printing prototyping techniques, this study proposed a hanging culture of Caco-2 cells that performed with high accuracy in predicting drug permeability in humans. As found, hanging cultured Caco-2 cells formed a confluent monolayer and maintained high cell viability on the 3D printed insert. Compared with the normal culture on Transwell, the Caco-2 cells on the 3D printed insert presented \u223c30-100% higher brush border enzyme activity and \u223c2-7 folds higher activity of P-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 during 21 days of incubation. For the eight membrane transporter substrates, the predictive curve of the 3D printing culture exhibited better linearity (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.92) to the human oral adsorption than that of the Transwell culture (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.84), indicating better prediction by the 3D printing culture.

{"title": "High-resolution direct 3D printed PLGA scaffolds: print and shrink.", "abstract": "Direct three-dimensional printing (3DP) produces the final part composed of the powder and binder used in fabrication. An advantage of direct 3DP is control over both the microarchitecture and macroarchitecture. Prints which use porogen incorporated in the powder result in high pore interconnectivity, uniform porosity, and defined pore size after leaching. The main limitations of direct 3DP for synthetic polymers are the use of organic solvents which can dissolve polymers used in most printheads and limited resolution due to unavoidable spreading of the binder droplet after contact with the powder. This study describes a materials processing strategy to eliminate the use of organic solvent during the printing process and to improve 3DP resolution by shrinking with a non-solvent plasticizer. Briefly, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) powder was prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation to form polymer microparticles. The printing powder was composed of polymer microparticles dry mixed with sucrose particles. After printing with a water-based liquid binder, the polymer microparticles were fused together to form a network by solvent vapor in an enclosed vessel. The sucrose is removed by leaching and the resulting scaffold is placed in a solution of methanol. The methanol acts as a non-solvent plasticizer and allows for polymer chain rearrangement and efficient packing of polymer chains. The resulting volumetric shrinkage is \u223c80% at 90% methanol. A complex shape (honey-comb) was designed, printed, and shrunken to demonstrate isotropic shrinking with the ability to reach a final resolution of \u223c400 \u03bcm. The effect of type of alcohol (i.e. methanol or ethanol), concentration of alcohol, and temperature on volumetric shrinking was studied.

Survival of ex vivo cultured, transplanted cells in tissue grafts is among one of the key barriers. Meniscus is a complex tissue consisting of collagen fibers and proteoglycans with gradient phenotypes of fibrocartilage and functions to provide congruence of the knee joint, without which the patient is likely to develop arthritis. Endogenous stem/progenitor cells regenerated the knee meniscus upon spatially released human connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b23 (TGF\u03b23) from a three-dimensional (3D)-printed biomaterial, enabling functional knee recovery. Sequentially applied CTGF and TGF\u03b23 were necessary and sufficient to propel mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, as a heterogeneous population or as single-cell progenies, into fibrochondrocytes that concurrently synthesized procollagens I and II\u03b1. When released from microchannels of 3D-printed, human meniscus scaffolds, CTGF and TGF\u03b23 induced endogenous stem/progenitor cells to differentiate and synthesize zone-specific type I and II collagens. We then replaced sheep meniscus with anatomically correct, 3D-printed scaffolds that incorporated spatially delivered CTGF and TGF\u03b23. Endogenous cells regenerated the meniscus with zone-specific matrix phenotypes: primarily type I collagen in the outer zone, and type II collagen in the inner zone, reminiscent of the native meniscus. Spatiotemporally delivered CTGF and TGF\u03b23 also restored inhomogeneous mechanical properties in the regenerated sheep meniscus.

Tantalum is an important metal for medical devices because of its good biocompatibility. In this study selective laser melting technology was used for the first time to manufacture highly porous pure tantalum implants with fully interconnected open pores. The architecture of the porous structure in combination with the material properties of tantalum result in mechanical properties close to those of human bone and allow for bone ingrowth. The bone regeneration performance of the porous tantalum was evaluated in vivo using an orthotopic load-bearing bone defect model in the rat femur. After 12 weeks, substantial bone ingrowth, good quality of the regenerated bone and a strong, functional implant-bone interface connection were observed. Compared to identical porous Ti-6Al-4V structures, laser-melted tantalum shows excellent osteoconductive properties, has a higher normalized fatigue strength and allows for more plastic deformation due to its high ductility. It is therefore concluded that this is a first step towards a new generation of open porous tantalum implants manufactured using selective laser melting.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-12-17", "authors": ["RubenWauthle", "Johanvan der Stok", "SaberAmin Yavari", "JanVan Humbeeck", "Jean-PierreKruth", "Amir AbbasZadpoor", "HarrieWeinans", "MichielMulier", "JanSchrooten"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.003"}

Two aminosalicylate isomers used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine) and 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA), were selected as model drugs. Commercially produced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filaments were loaded with the drugs in an ethanolic drug solution. A final drug-loading of 0.06% w/w and 0.25% w/w was achieved for the 5-ASA and 4-ASA strands, respectively. 10.5mm diameter tablets of both PVA/4-ASA and PVA/5-ASA were subsequently printed using an FDM 3D printer, and varying the weight and densities of the printed tablets was achieved by selecting the infill percentage in the printer software. The tablets were mechanically strong, and the FDM 3D printing was shown to be an effective process for the manufacture of the drug, 5-ASA. Significant thermal degradation of the active 4-ASA (50%) occurred during printing, however, indicating that the method may not be appropriate for drugs when printing at high temperatures exceeding those of the degradation point. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the formulated blends confirmed these findings while highlighting the potential of thermal analytical techniques to anticipate drug degradation issues in the 3D printing process. The results of the dissolution tests conducted in modified Hank's bicarbonate buffer showed that release profiles for both drugs were dependent on both the drug itself and on the infill percentage of the tablet.

Anisotropic behaviour of constructs and part failure at the boundaries of interlayer bonds was highlighted by compressive strength testing. A trade-off between the ability to facilitate removal of PVOH thermal degradation products during sintering and the compressive strength of green parts was revealed.

Critically, the pores of 3D printed constructs could be user designed, ensuring bulk interconnectivity, and the imperfect packing of powder particles created an inherent surface roughness and non-designed porosity within the scaffold.

The research described here aims to inform researchers interested in melt electrospinning about technical aspects of the process. This includes rapid fiber characterization using glass microscope slides, allowing influential processing parameters on fiber morphology to be assessed, as well as observed fiber collection phenomena on different collector substrates. The distribution and alignment of melt electrospun PCL fibers can be controlled to a certain degree using patterned collectors to create large numbers of scaffolds with shaped macroporous architectures. However, the buildup of residual charge in the collected fibers limits the achievable thickness of the porous template through such scaffolds.

Studying single aggregates as well as spatially organized aggregates remains challenging because of the technical difficulties associated with manipulating small populations. Micro-3D printing is a lithographic technique capable of creating aggregates in situ by printing protein-based walls around individual cells or small populations. This 3D-printing strategy can organize bacteria in complex arrangements to investigate how spatial and environmental parameters influence social behaviors. Here, we combined micro-3D printing and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to probe quorum sensing (QS)-mediated communication in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results reveal that QS-dependent behaviors are observed within aggregates as small as 500 cells; however, aggregates larger than 2,000 bacteria are required to stimulate QS in neighboring aggregates positioned 8 \u03bcm away.

The ECM-ornamented 3D printed scaffolds supported osteoblastic differentiation of newly-seeded hTMSCs by upregulating four typical osteoblastic genes (4-fold higher RUNX2; 3-fold higher ALP; 4-fold higher osteocalcin; and 4-fold higher osteopontin) and increasing calcium deposition compared to bare 3D printed scaffolds. In vivo, in ectopic and orthotopic models in rats, ECM-ornamented scaffolds induced greater bone formation than that of bare scaffolds. These results suggest a valuable method to produce ECM-ornamented 3D printed scaffolds as off-the-shelf bone graft substitutes that combine tunable physical properties with physiological presentation of biological signals.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2014-12-03", "authors": ["FalguniPati", "Tae-HaSong", "GirdhariRijal", "JinahJang", "Sung WonKim", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.10.012"}
{"title": "The substrate-dependent regeneration capacity of mesenchymal stem cell spheroids derived on various biomaterial surfaces.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for their self-renewal and multipotent abilities, which can be further enhanced by growing MSCs as three-dimensional (3D) cellular spheroids on certain substrates. Although various surfaces have been used to generate 3D MSC spheroids, the answer to whether all these spheroids have similar in vitro and in vivo properties remains unclear. In this study, adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADSCs) were cultured on a non-adherent Petri dish, polyvinyl alcohol, chitosan (CS), or chitosan-hyaluronan (CS-HA) to form 3D spheroids. The expression of the cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The functional migration ability was tested using the transwell assay. The capacity for chondral regeneration of various ADSC spheroids was further evaluated in a rabbit model. We demonstrated that ADSC spheroids derived on the CS or CS-HA surface had the greater expression of N-cadherin and better migration ability. The latter was consistent with the higher expression levels of chemokine/receptor SDF-1/CXCR4 for the spheroids derived on CS or CS-HA. Animal studies also revealed significantly better cartilage repair in defects loaded with CS- or CS-HA-derived spheroids. In particular, CS-HA-derived spheroids gave rise to the best regeneration when combined with a 3D printed scaffold. This study suggested that MSC spheroids derived on different surfaces may have distinct in vitro and in vivo properties, which appeared to be associated with the surface-bound calcium as well as the calcium-dependent N-cadherin and CXCR4 signaling. The substrate-dependent properties may eventually lead to different regeneration capacities of various MSC spheroids in vivo.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2014-11-30", "authors": ["Guo-ShiangHuang", "Pai-ShanHsieh", "Ching-ShiowTseng", "Shan-HuiHsu"], "doi": "10.1039/c4bm00053f"}

Firstly the anatomy is scanned with a 3D scanner, then a tissue casting mold is designed on computer and printed with a desktop 3D printer. Subsequently, a chemical polishing method is used to polish the casting mold by removing the staircase effect and acquiring a smooth surface. Finally, the last step is to cast medical grade silicone into the mold. After the silicone is cured, the fine soft prostheses can be removed from the mold. Utilizing the SPPC method, soft prostheses with smooth surface and complicated structure can be fabricated at a low cost.

To achieve this, two techniques were combined and used: T-Junction microfluidics and electrohydrodynamic (EHD) processing. The former was used to form layers of monodispersed bovine serum albumin (BSA) bubbles, which upon drying formed porous scaffolds. By altering the T-Junction processing parameters, bubbles with different diameters were produced and hence the scaffold porosity could be controlled. EHD processing was used to spray or spin poly(lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA), polymethysilsesquioxane (PMSQ) and collagen particles/fibres onto the scaffolds during their production and after drying. As a result, multifunctional BSA scaffolds with controlled porosity containing PLGA, PMSQ and collagen particles/fibres were obtained.

{"title": "Linear interfacial polymerization: theory and simulations with dissipative particle dynamics.", "abstract": "Step-growth alternating interfacial polymerization between two miscible or immiscible monomer melts is investigated theoretically and by dissipative particle dynamics simulations. In both cases the kinetics for an initially bilayer system passes from the reaction to diffusion control. The polymer composed of immiscible monomers precipitates at the interface forming a film of nearly uniform density. It is demonstrated that the reaction proceeds in a narrow zone, which expands much slower than the whole film, so that newly formed polymer is extruded from the reaction zone. This concept of \"reactive extrusion\" is used to analytically predict the degree of polymerization and distribution of all components (monomers, polymer, and end groups) within the film in close agreement with the simulations. Increasing the comonomer incompatibility leads to thinner and more uniform films with the higher average degree of polymerization. The final product is considerably more polydisperse than expected for the homogeneous step-growth polymerization. The results extend the previous theoretical reports on interfacial polymerization and provide new insights into the internal film structure and polymer characteristics, which are important for membrane preparation, microencapsulation, and 3D printing technologies.

{"title": "Method for minimising rolling joint play in the steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype DragonFlex.", "abstract": "The steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype DragonFlex was recently developed with the vision of a minimalistic fully functional design, readily produced by additive manufacturing and requiring little assembly. Steering functionality is provided by rolling joints that, besides simplifying the assembly, help minimise cable fatigue and equalise force requirements on steering cables. However, the perfectly circular rolling joint design introduced some mechanism play, undermining the joint's bending stiffness. Hence, the aim of this paper is to present an innovative solution for play reduction in rolling joints.\nThe original play-compensating mechanism, a shaft-embedded compression spring, proved unsatisfactory for play reduction. Therefore, a new non-circular rolling joint curvature was designed with the objective to compensate for any cable slack and thus minimise the joint play. The new rolling joint design was evaluated in several tip deflection experiments and compared to the original one.\nThe experimental results proved that the optimised rolling joint curvature significantly minimises play, thus being a major improvement compared to the original design. The optimised rolling joint was implemented in a new real-scale DragonFlex prototype. The presented optimisation method enables elimination of a conventionally used cable tensioning device and it is generally applicable to steerable minimally invasive instruments that use a rolling joint.", "journal": "Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy", "date": "2014-11-20", "authors": ["FilipJel\u00ednek", "TomDiepens", "SanderDobbenga", "Geertvan der Jagt", "DaveyKreeft", "AnnemijnSmid", "RobPessers", "PaulBreedveld"], "doi": "10.3109/13645706.2014.968170"}

{"title": "Improved resolution of 3D printed scaffolds by shrinking.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing (3DP) uses inkjet printheads to selectively deposit liquid binder to adjoin powder particles in a layer-by-layer fashion to create a computer-modeled 3D object. Two general approaches for 3DP have been described for biomedical applications (direct and indirect 3DP). The two approaches offer competing advantages, and both are limited by print resolution. This study describes a materials processing strategy to enhance 3DP resolution by controlled shrinking net-shape scaffolds. Briefly, porogen preforms are printed and infused with the desired monomer or polymer solution. After solidification or polymerization, the porogen is leached and the polymer is allowed to shrink by controlled drying. Heat treatment is performed to retain the dimensions against swelling forces. The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of polymer content and post-processing on dimension, microstructure, and thermomechanical properties of the scaffold. For polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA), reducing polymer content corresponded with greater shrinkage with maximum shrinkage of \u223c80 vol% at 20% vol% PEG-DA. The secondary heat treatment retains the microarchitecture and new dimensions of the scaffolds, even when the heat-treated scaffolds are immersed into water. To demonstrate shrinkage predictability, 3D components with interlocking positive and negative features were printed, processed, and fitted. This material processing strategy provides an alternative method to enhance the resolution of 3D scaffolds, for a wide range of polymers, without optimizing the binder-powder interaction physics to print each material combination.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

This allows one, in microbiological studies, to isolate a known number of cells in a micrometer-sized chamber with a roof and walls that are permeable to small molecules and observe metabolic products. In such studies, the size and spatial organization of a population play a crucial role in cellular group behaviors, such as intercellular interactions and communication. Micro-3D printing, a photolithographic method for constructing cross-linked protein microstructures, permits one to compartmentalize a small population of microbes by forming a porous roof and walls around cells in situ. Since the roof and walls defining the microchamber are porous, any small molecules can freely diffuse from the chamber to be detected and quantified using SECM. The size of the chamber and the roof permeability can be obtained by SECM using a small probe molecule, ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH). The chamber permeability to FcMeOH can be tuned by varying printing parameters that influence the cross-linking density of the proteinaceous material. These analyses establish a versatile strategy as a sensitive platform to quantitatively monitor small molecules produced by microbes.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2014-11-18", "authors": ["JiyeonKim", "Jodi LConnell", "MarvinWhiteley", "Allen JBard"], "doi": "10.1021/ac5036204"}

{"title": "The fusion of tissue spheroids attached to pre-stretched electrospun polyurethane scaffolds.", "abstract": "Effective cell invasion into thick electrospun biomimetic scaffolds is an unsolved problem. One possible strategy to biofabricate tissue constructs of desirable thickness and material properties without the need for cell invasion is to use thin (<2 \u00b5m) porous electrospun meshes and self-assembling (capable of tissue fusion) tissue spheroids as building blocks. Pre-stretched electrospun meshes remained taut in cell culture and were able to support tissue spheroids with minimal deformation. We hypothesize that elastic electrospun scaffolds could be used as temporal support templates for rapid self-assembly of cell spheroids into higher order tissue structures, such as engineered vascular tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate how the attachment of tissue spheroids to pre-stretched polyurethane scaffolds may interfere with the tissue fusion process. Tissue spheroids attached, spread, and fused after being placed on pre-stretched polyurethane electrospun matrices and formed tissue constructs. Efforts to eliminate hole defects with fibrogenic tissue growth factor-\u03b2 resulted in the increased synthesis of collagen and periostin and a dramatic reduction in hole size and number. In control experiments, tissue spheroids fuse on a non-adhesive hydrogel and form continuous tissue constructs without holes. Our data demonstrate that tissue spheroids attached to thin stretched elastic electrospun scaffolds have an interrupted tissue fusion process. The resulting tissue-engineered construct phenotype is a direct outcome of the delicate balance of the competing physical forces operating during the tissue fusion process at the interface of the pre-stretched elastic scaffold and the attached tissue spheroids.

The hydrogel was supplemented either with polyphosphate (polyP), administered as polyP \u2022 Ca2+-complex, or silica, or as biosilica that had been enzymatically prepared from ortho-silicate by silicatein. These hydrogels, together with SaOS-2 cells, were bioprinted to computer-designed scaffolds. The results revealed that bioglass (nano)particles, with a size of 55 nm and a molar ratio of SiO2 : CaO : P2O5 of 55 : 40 : 5, did not affect the growth of the encapsulated cells. If silica, biosilica, or polyP \u2022 Ca2+-complex is co-added to the cell-containing alginate/gelatin hydrogel the growth behavior of the cells is not changed. Addition of 5 mg/ml of bioglass particles to this hydrogel significantly enhanced the potency of the entrapped SaOS-2 cells to mineralize. If compared with the extent of the cells to form mineral deposits in the absence of bioglass, the cells exposed to bioglass together with 100 \u00b5moles/L polyP \u2022 Ca2+-complex increased their mineralization activity from 2.1- to 3.9-fold, or with 50 \u00b5moles/L silica from 1.8- to 2.9-fold, or with 50 \u00b5moles/L biosilica from 2.7- to 4.8-fold or with the two components together (100 \u00b5moles/L polyP \u2022 Ca2+-complex and 50 \u00b5moles/L biosilica) from 4.1- to 6.8-fold. Element analysis by EDX spectrometry of the mineral nodules formed by SaOS-2 revealed an accumulation of O, P, Ca and C, indicating that the mineral deposits contain, besides Ca-phosphate also Ca-carbonate. The results show that bioglass added to alginate/gelatin hydrogel increases the proliferation and mineralization of bioprinted SaOS-2 cells.

The current therapies for cardiac infarction mainly take effect by eliminating occlusion in coronary artery by thrombolysis drugs, vascular stent grafting or heart bypass operation, which are capable to provide sufficient blood flow for intact myocardium yet showed subtle efficacy in ameliorating fibrosis condition. The advances of in vitro cell/tissue models open new avenues for drug assessment due to the low cost, good controllability and availability as well as the convenience for operation as compared to the animal models. To our knowledge, no proper biomimetic in vitro cardiac fibrosis model has been reported yet. Here we engineered an in vitro cardiac fibrosis model using heart-derived fibroblasts, and the fibrogenesis was recapitulated by patterning the substrate rigidity which mimicked the mechanical heterogeneity of myocardium post-infarction.

{"title": "Enzymatically synthesized inorganic polymers as morphogenetically active bone scaffolds: application in regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "In recent years a paradigm shift in understanding of human bone formation has occurred that starts to change current concepts in tissue engineering of bone and cartilage. New discoveries revealed that fundamental steps in biomineralization are enzyme driven, not only during hydroxyapatite deposition, but also during initial bioseed formation, involving the transient deposition and subsequent transformation of calcium carbonate to calcium phosphate mineral. The principal enzymes mediating these reactions, carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase, open novel targets for pharmacological intervention of bone diseases like osteoporosis, by applying compounds acting as potential activators of these enzymes. It is expected that these new findings will give an innovation boost for the development of scaffolds for bone repair and reconstruction, which began with the use of bioinert materials, followed by bioactive materials and now leading to functional regenerative tissue units. These new developments have become possible with the discovery of the morphogenic activity of bioinorganic polymers, biocalcit, bio-polyphosphate and biosilica that are formed by a biogenic, enzymatic mechanism, a driving force along with the development of novel rapid-prototyping three-dimensional (3D) printing methods and bioprinting (3D cell printing) techniques that may allow a fabrication of customized implants for patients suffering in bone diseases in the future.", "journal": "International review of cell and molecular biology", "date": "2014-11-08", "authors": ["XiaohongWang", "Heinz CSchr\u00f6der", "Werner E GM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-800177-6.00002-5"}
{"title": "A system for evaluating magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer using patient-specific 3D printed molds.", "abstract": "We have developed a system for evaluating magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer, using patient-specific 3D printed molds to facilitate MR-histology correlation. Prior to radical prostatectomy a patient receives a multiparametric MRI, which an expert genitourinary radiologist uses to identify and contour regions suspicious for disease. The same MR series is used to generate a prostate contour, which is the basis for design of a patient-specific mold. The 3D printed mold contains a series of evenly spaced parallel slits, each of which corresponds to a known MRI slice. After surgery, the patient's specimen is enclosed within the mold, and all whole-mount levels are obtained simultaneously through use of a multi-bladed slicing device. The levels are then formalin fixed, processed, and delivered to an expert pathologist, who identifies and grades all lesions within the slides. Finally, the lesion contours are loaded into custom software, which elastically warps them to fit the MR prostate contour. The suspicious regions on MR can then be directly compared to lesions on histology. Furthermore, the false-negative and false-positive regions on MR can be retrospectively examined, with the ultimate goal of developing methods for improving the predictive accuracy of MRI. This work presents the details of our analysis method, following a patient from diagnosis through the MR-histology correlation process. For this patient MRI successfully predicted the presence of cancer, but true lesion volume and extent were underestimated. Most cancer-positive regions missed on MR were observed to have patterns of low T2 signal, suggesting that there is potential to improve sensitivity.", "journal": "American journal of clinical and experimental urology", "date": "2014-11-07", "authors": ["AlanPriester", "ShyamNatarajan", "Jesse DLe", "JamesGarritano", "BryanRadosavcev", "WarrenGrundfest", "Daniel JaMargolis", "Leonard SMarks", "JiaotiHuang"], "doi": null}
{"title": "3D printed quantum dot light-emitting diodes.", "abstract": "Developing the ability to 3D print various classes of materials possessing distinct properties could enable the freeform generation of active electronics in unique functional, interwoven architectures. Achieving seamless integration of diverse materials with 3D printing is a significant challenge that requires overcoming discrepancies in material properties in addition to ensuring that all the materials are compatible with the 3D printing process. To date, 3D printing has been limited to specific plastics, passive conductors, and a few biological materials. Here, we show that diverse classes of materials can be 3D printed and fully integrated into device components with active properties. Specifically, we demonstrate the seamless interweaving of five different materials, including (1) emissive semiconducting inorganic nanoparticles, (2) an elastomeric matrix, (3) organic polymers as charge transport layers, (4) solid and liquid metal leads, and (5) a UV-adhesive transparent substrate layer. As a proof of concept for demonstrating the integrated functionality of these materials, we 3D printed quantum dot-based light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) that exhibit pure and tunable color emission properties. By further incorporating the 3D scanning of surface topologies, we demonstrate the ability to conformally print devices onto curvilinear surfaces, such as contact lenses. Finally, we show that novel architectures that are not easily accessed using standard microfabrication techniques can be constructed, by 3D printing a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 cube of encapsulated LEDs, in which every component of the cube and electronics are 3D printed.

The models were printed using a Polyjet printer, Eden 260V (Objet-Stratasys). To verify the phantom geometry accuracy, the phantom was reimaged using rotational DSA, and the new data was compared with the initial patient data. The most challenging part of the phantom manufacturing was removal of support material. This aspect could be a serious hurdle in building very tortuous phantoms or small vessels. The accuracy of the printed models was very good: distance analysis showed average differences of 120 \u03bcm between the patient and the phantom reconstructed volume dimensions.

This paper aims to assess the ease of learning endoscopic skull base exposure and drilling techniques using an anatomically accurate physical model with a pre-existing pathology (i.e., basilar invagination) created from actual patient data. Five models of a patient with platy-basia and basilar invagination were created from the original MRI and CT imaging data of a patient. The models were used as part of a training workshop for ENT surgeons with varying degrees of experience in endoscopic base of skull surgery, from trainees to experienced consultants. The surgeons were given a list of key steps to achieve in exposing and drilling the skull base using the simulation model. They were then asked to list the level of difficulty of learning these steps using the model.

In this study, we used a human trabecular bone template to design and manufacture Ti-6Al-4V constructs with varying porosity via laser sintering. Characterization of constructs revealed interconnected porosities ranging from 15-70% with compressive moduli of 2579-3693 MPa. These constructs with macro porosity were further surface-treated to create a desirable multi-scale micro-/nano-roughness, which has been shown to enhance the osseointegration process. Osteoblasts (MG63 cells) exhibited high viability when grown on the constructs. Proliferation (DNA) and alkaline phosphatase specific activity, an early differentiation marker, decreased as porosity increased, while osteocalcin, a late differentiation marker, as well as osteoprotegerin, vascular endothelial growth factor and bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 increased with increasing porosity. Three-dimensional (3D) constructs with the highest porosity and surface modification supported the greatest osteoblast differentiation and local factor production. These results indicate that additively manufactured 3D porous constructs mimicking human trabecular bone and produced with additional surface treatment can be customized for increased osteoblast response. Increased factors for osteoblast maturation and differentiation on high porosity constructs suggest the enhanced performance of these surfaces for increasing osseointegration in vivo.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-10-08", "authors": ["AliceCheng", "AizaHumayun", "David JCohen", "Barbara DBoyan", "ZviSchwartz"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/4/045007"}

Commercially produced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filament was loaded with a model drug (fluorescein) by swelling of the polymer in ethanolic drug solution. A final drug-loading of 0.29% w/w was achieved. Tablets of PVA/fluorescein (10 mm diameter) were printed using a 3D printer.

The tablets were mechanically strong and no significant thermal degradation of the active occurred during printing. Dissolution tests were conducted in modified Hank's buffer. The results showed release profiles were dependent on the infill percentage used to print the tablet. The study indicates that FF 3DP has the potential to offer a new solution for fabricating personalized-dose medicines or unit dosage forms with controlled-release profiles.

{"title": "Aligned and suspended fiber force probes for drug testing at single cell resolution.", "abstract": "The role of physical forces in disease onset and progression is widely accepted and this knowledge presents an alternative route to investigating disease models. Recently, numerous force measurement techniques have been developed to probe single and multi-cell behavior. While these methods have yielded fundamental insights, they are yet unable to capture the fibrous extra-cellular matrix biophysical interactions, involving parameters of curvature, structural stiffness (N m(-1)), alignment and hierarchy, which have been shown to play key roles in disease and developmental biology. Using a highly aggressive glioma model (DBTRG-05MG), we present a platform technology to quantify single cell force modulation (both inside-out and outside-in) with and without the presence of a cytoskeleton altering drug (cytochalasin D) using suspended and aligned fiber networks (nanonets) beginning to represent the aligned glioma environment. The nanonets fused in crisscross patterns were manufactured using the non-electrospinning spinneret based tunable engineering parameters technique. We demonstrate the ability to measure contractile single cell forces exerted by glioma cells attached to and migrating along the fiber axis (inside-out). This is followed by a study of force response of glioma cells attached to two parallel fibers using a probe deflecting the leading fiber (outside-in). The forces are calculated using beam deflection within the elastic limit. Our data shows that cytochalasin D compromises the spreading area of single glioma cells, eventually decreasing their 'inside-out' contractile forces, and 'outside-in' force response to external strain. Most notably, for the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of using physiologically relevant aligned fiber networks as ultra-sensitive force (\u223cnanoNewtons) probes for investigating drug response and efficacy in disease models at the single cell resolution.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-09-30", "authors": ["PujaSharma", "AhRamKim", "AmritpalGill", "JiWang", "KevinSheets", "BaharehBehkam", "Amrinder SNain"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/4/045006"}

Compared to reported polymer-bonded MBG scaffolds, the incorporation of the biocompatible PHBHHx polymer as a particle binder enhanced their bioactive and osteogenic properties, including fast apatite-forming ability, and promoted human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hBMSC) adhesion, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and bone-related gene expression. Furthermore, MBG/PHBHHx composite scaffolds were explored to repair critical-size rat calvarial defects. The results showed that MBG/PHBHHx composite scaffolds exhibited a controlled degradation rate and more significant potential to stabilize the pH environment with increasing PHBHHx ratio. At 8 weeks post-implantation, MBG/PHBHHx scaffolds were demonstrated to stimulate bone regeneration in the calvarial defects and have largely repaired them through analysis of micro-CT, sequential fluorescent labeling and histology.

Printing of viable organ replacements, however, is dependent on bioinks with appropriate rheological and cytocompatible properties. In cartilage engineering, photocrosslinkable glycosaminoglycan-based hydrogels are chondrogenic, but alone have generally poor printing properties. By blending the thermoresponsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) grafted hyaluronan (HA-pNIPAAM) with methacrylated hyaluronan (HAMA), high-resolution scaffolds with good viability were printed. HA-pNIPAAM provided fast gelation and immediate post-printing structural fidelity, while HAMA ensured long-term mechanical stability upon photocrosslinking. The bioink was evaluated for rheological properties, swelling behavior, printability and biocompatibility of encapsulated bovine chondrocytes. Elution of HA-pNIPAAM from the scaffold was necessary to obtain good viability. HA-pNIPAAM can therefore be used to support extrusion of a range of biopolymers which undergo tandem gelation, thereby facilitating the printing of cell-laden, stratified cartilage constructs with zonally varying composition and stiffness.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2014-09-28", "authors": ["MattiKesti", "MichaelM\u00fcller", "JanaBecher", "MatthiasSchnabelrauch", "MatteoD'Este", "DavidEglin", "MarcyZenobi-Wong"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.033"}

Slice chambers were produced using five available plastics: ABS, PLA, Nylon 618, Nylon 680, and T-glase. These \"lab-made\" chambers were also made using stereolithography through a professional printing service (Shapeways). This study measured intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the brain stem pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and layer V pyramidal neurons in retrosplenial cortex.\nNylon 680 and T-glase significantly hyperpolarized PPN neurons. ABS increased input resistance, decreased action potential amplitude, and increased firing frequency in pyramidal cortical neurons. To test long term exposure to each plastic, human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell cultures were exposed to each plastic for 1 week. ABS decreased cell counts while Nylon 618 and Shapeways plastics eliminated cells. Primary mouse pituitary cultures were also tested for 24-h exposure. ABS decreased cell counts while Nylon 618 and Shapeways plastics dramatically decreased cell counts.\nChambers can be quickly and inexpensively printed in the lab. ABS, PLA, Nylon 680, and T-glase plastics would suffice for many experiments instead of commercially produced slice chambers.\nWhile these technologies are still in their infancy, they represent a powerful addition to the lab environment.

Typically, microfluidic systems are constructed in monolithic form by means of microfabrication and, increasingly, by additive techniques. These methods restrict the design and assembly of truly complex systems by placing unnecessary emphasis on complete functional integration of operational elements in a planar environment. Here, we present a solution based on discrete elements that liberates designers to build large-scale microfluidic systems in three dimensions that are modular, diverse, and predictable by simple network analysis techniques. We develop a sample library of standardized components and connectors manufactured using stereolithography. We predict and validate the flow characteristics of these individual components to design and construct a tunable concentration gradient generator with a scalable number of parallel outputs. We show that these systems are rapidly reconfigurable by constructing three variations of a device for generating monodisperse microdroplets in two distinct size regimes and in a high-throughput mode by simple replacement of emulsifier subcircuits. Finally, we demonstrate the capability for active process monitoring by constructing an optical sensing element for detecting water droplets in a fluorocarbon stream and quantifying their size and frequency. By moving away from large-scale integration toward standardized discrete elements, we demonstrate the potential to reduce the practice of designing and assembling complex 3D microfluidic circuits to a methodology comparable to that found in the electronics industry.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-09-24", "authors": ["Krisna CBhargava", "BryantThompson", "NoahMalmstadt"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1414764111"}

To date, there is no in vitro technique for studying vascular function over relevant disease time courses that both mimics in vivo-like tissue structure and provides a simple readout of tissue stress. We aimed to extend tissue viability in our muscular thin film contractility assay by modifying the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate with micropatterned genipin, allowing extracellular matrix turnover without cell loss. To achieve this, we developed a microfluidic delivery system to pattern genipin and extracellular matrix proteins on PDMS prior to cell seeding. Tissues constructed using this method showed improved viability and maintenance of in vivo-like lamellar structure. Functional contractility of tissues fabricated on genipin-modified substrates remained consistent throughout two weeks in culture.

However, progress in this field is currently extremely slow due to limited choices of bioink for cell encapsulation and cytocompatible gelation mechanisms. Here we report the development of clinically relevant sized tissue analogs by 3-D bioprinting, delivering human nasal inferior turbinate tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells encapsulated in silk fibroin-gelatin (SF-G) bioink. Gelation in this bioink was induced via in situ cytocompatible gelation mechanisms, namely enzymatic crosslinking by mushroom tyrosinase and physical crosslinking via sonication. Mechanistically, tyrosinases oxidize the accessible tyrosine residues of silk and/or gelatin into reactive o-quinone moieties that can either condense with each other or undergo nonenzymatic reactions with available amines of both silk and gelatin. Sonication alters the hydrophobic interaction and accelerates self-assembly of silk fibroin macromolecules to form \u03b2-sheet crystals, which physically crosslink the hydrogel. However, sonication has no effect on the conformation of gelatin. The effect of optimized rheology, secondary conformations of silk-gelatin bioink, temporally controllable gelation strategies and printing parameters were assessed to achieve maximum cell viability and multilineage differentiation of the encapsulated human nasal inferior turbinate tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells.

We hypothesize that besides good printability and cytocompatibility of a supporting hydrogel for the manufacture of individual tissues, it is equally essential to consider beforehand the desired tissue (bone, cartilage, fat). In light of its application, the structure and stiffness of printable hydrogel matrices influence cell geometry, which in turn impacts the differentiation fate. Embedded human mesenchymal stromal cells in printable type I collagen- and chitosan-agarose blends were induced to differentiate toward osteoblasts and adipocytes. Hydrogels' printability in air versus submerged printing in perfluorocarbon was evaluated according to the height, diameter, uniformity, and stability of 3D printed vertical cylinders. Bipotent differentiation within hydrogels was assessed histologically (morphology, cellularity), by immunohistochemistry (vimentin, smooth muscle actin), two-photon microscopy (spatial distribution), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (ALP, BGLAP, OPN, RUNX2, COL 1, aP2, PPAR\u03b3-2). Agarose and agarose blends revealed the most valid printability properties by generating uniform cylinders with an average height of 4\u2009mm.

Because of altered anatomy of dysplastic hips, THA in these patients represents technically demanding procedure. Distorted anatomy of the acetabulum and proximal femur together with conjoined leg length discrepancy present major challenges during performing THA in patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip. In addition, most patients are at younger age, therefore, soft tissue balance is of great importance (especially the need to preserve the continuity of abductors) to maximise postoperative functional result.

{"title": "The pumping lid: investigating multi-material 3D printing for equipment-free, programmable generation of positive and negative pressures for microfluidic applications.", "abstract": "Equipment-free pumping is a challenging problem and an active area of research in microfluidics, with applications for both laboratory and limited-resource settings. This paper describes the pumping lid method, a strategy to achieve equipment-free pumping by controlled generation of pressure. Pressure was generated using portable, lightweight, and disposable parts that can be integrated with existing microfluidic devices to simplify workflow and eliminate the need for pumping equipment. The development of this method was enabled by multi-material 3D printing, which allows fast prototyping, including composite parts that combine materials with different mechanical properties (e.g. both rigid and elastic materials in the same part). The first type of pumping lid we describe was used to produce predictable positive or negative pressures via controlled compression or expansion of gases. A model was developed to describe the pressures and flow rates generated with this approach and it was validated experimentally. Pressures were pre-programmed by the geometry of the parts and could be tuned further even while the experiment was in progress. Using multiple lids or a composite lid with different inlets enabled several solutions to be pumped independently in a single device. The second type of pumping lid, which relied on vapor-liquid equilibrium to generate pressure, was designed, modeled, and experimentally characterized. The pumping lid method was validated by controlling flow in different types of microfluidic applications, including the production of droplets, control of laminar flow profiles, and loading of SlipChip devices. We believe that applying the pumping lid methodology to existing microfluidic devices will enhance their use as portable diagnostic tools in limited resource settings as well as accelerate adoption of microfluidics in laboratories.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2014-09-19", "authors": ["StefanoBegolo", "Dmitriy VZhukov", "David ASelck", "LiangLi", "Rustem FIsmagilov"], "doi": "10.1039/c4lc00910j"}

{"title": "Digital design and fabrication of simulation model for measuring orthodontic force.", "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) forces are the key factors for determining movement of teeth during orthodontic treatment. Designing precise forces and torques on tooth before treatment can result accurate tooth movements, but it is too difficult to realize. In orthodontic biomechanical systems, the periodontal tissues, including bones, teeth, and periodontal ligaments (PDL), are affected by braces, and measuring the forces applied on the teeth by braces should be based on a simulated model composed of these three types of tissues. This study explores the design and fabrication of a simulated oral model for 3D orthodontic force measurements. Based on medical image processing, tissue reconstruction, 3D printing, and PDL simulation and testing, a model for measuring force was designed and fabricated, which can potentially be used for force prediction, design of treatment plans, and precise clinical operation. The experiment illustrated that bi-component silicones with 2:8 ratios had similar mechanical properties to PDL, and with a positioning guide, the teeth were assembled in the mandible sockets accurately, and so a customized oral model for 3D orthodontic force measurement was created.", "journal": "Bio-medical materials and engineering", "date": "2014-09-18", "authors": ["Yun-FengLiu", "Peng-YuanZhang", "Qiao-FangZhang", "Jian-XingZhang", "JieChen"], "doi": "10.3233/BME-141039"}
{"title": "Bioreplicated visual features of nanofabricated buprestid beetle decoys evoke stereotypical male mating flights.", "abstract": "Recent advances in nanoscale bioreplication processes present the potential for novel basic and applied research into organismal behavioral processes. Insect behavior potentially could be affected by physical features existing at the nanoscale level. We used nano-bioreplicated visual decoys of female emerald ash borer beetles (Agrilus planipennis) to evoke stereotypical mate-finding behavior, whereby males fly to and alight on the decoys as they would on real females. Using an industrially scalable nanomolding process, we replicated and evaluated the importance of two features of the outer cuticular surface of the beetle's wings: structural interference coloration of the elytra by multilayering of the epicuticle and fine-scale surface features consisting of spicules and spines that scatter light into intense strands. Two types of decoys that lacked one or both of these elements were fabricated, one type nano-bioreplicated and the other 3D-printed with no bioreplicated surface nanostructural elements. Both types were colored with green paint. The light-scattering properties of the nano-bioreplicated surfaces were verified by shining a white laser on the decoys in a dark room and projecting the scattering pattern onto a white surface. Regardless of the coloration mechanism, the nano-bioreplicated decoys evoked the complete attraction and landing sequence of Agrilus males. In contrast, males made brief flying approaches toward the decoys without nanostructured features, but diverted away before alighting on them. The nano-bioreplicated decoys were also electroconductive, a feature used on traps such that beetles alighting onto them were stunned, killed, and collected.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2014-09-17", "authors": ["Michael JDomingue", "AkhleshLakhtakia", "Drew PPulsifer", "Loyal PHall", "John VBadding", "Jesse LBischof", "Ra\u00fal JMart\u00edn-Palma", "Zolt\u00e1nImrei", "GergelyJanik", "Victor CMastro", "MissyHazen", "Thomas CBaker"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1412810111\n10.1007/s10340-014-0598-y"}

However, there is currently a lack of effective drugs that deal with ROS. Platinum nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) have proven to be promising antioxidant drugs in vitro and in vivo. To optimize the efficacy of Pt-NP based drugs, we synthesized and characterized the ROS scavenging properties of three kinds of small molecules that capped Pt-NPs (Pt-AMP-NPs, Pt-ATT-NPs, Pt-MI-NPs) on a blood vessel-mimicking microfluidic chip. The Pt-NPs showed superior superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like functions and can scavenge ROS and recover compromised cell-cell junctions under hyperglycemic, hyperlipidemic and proinflammatory conditions. Amongst these NPs, Pt-AMP-NPs showed the most superior antioxidant properties, suggesting its potency to serve as a novel drug to treat vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

Additionally, the BM-laminin is involved in the formation of gap junctions (GJs), which regulate electrical coupling between two CMs in the myocardium. The role of BM in GJ maturation remains unclear because of the complicated in vivo structures and lack of an ideal in vitro culturing mode. In this study, our laser cell-micropatterning system was used to place two neonatal CMs (NCMs) in contact on an aligned collagen gel (ACG) to study the relationship between GJ maturation and BM development. The results of double immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging showed that BM-laminin was deposited earlier than the formation of GJs in the intercellular space and that newly expressed connexin 43 clusters were preferentially assembled near the deposited BM structures. Eventually the BM network surrounded the GJs.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-09-13", "authors": ["HuaxiaoYang", "Thomas KBorg", "Lucas PSchmidt", "Bruce ZGao"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/4/045003"}
{"title": "Fabrication and perfusion culture of anatomically shaped artificial bone using stereolithography.", "abstract": "Because patient bone defects are usually varied and complicated in geometry, it would be preferred to fabricate custom-made artificial bone grafts that are anatomically specific to individual patient defects. Using a rabbit femoral segment as a bone reconstruction model, we successfully produced customized ceramic scaffolds by stereolithography, which not only had an anatomically correct external shape according to computed tomography data but also contained an interconnecting internal network of channels designed for perfusion culture. Rabbit bone marrow stromal cells were isolated and cultured with these scaffolds using a novel oscillatory perfusion system that was stereolithographically fabricated to fit well to the unique scaffold shapes. After five days of three-dimensional culture with oscillatory perfusion, the cells attached and proliferated homogenously in the scaffolds. However, control cells inside the scaffolds cultured under static conditions were dead after prolonged in vitro culture. Cellular DNA content and alkaline phosphatase activities were significantly higher in the perfusion group versus the static group. Therefore, anatomically correct artificial bone can be successfully constructed using stereolithography and oscillatory culture technology, and could be useful for bone engraftment and defect repair.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-09-13", "authors": ["DajiangDu", "TeruoAsaoka", "TakashiUshida", "Katsuko SFurukawa"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/4/045002"}

{"title": "Design and production of 3D printed bolus for electron radiation therapy.", "abstract": "This is a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the capacity for modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT) dose distributions using 3D printed bolus. Previous reports have involved bolus design using an electron pencil beam model and fabrication using a milling machine. In this study, an in-house algorithm is presented that optimizes the dose distribution with regard to dose coverage, conformity, and homogeneity within the planning target volume (PTV). The algorithm takes advantage of a commercial electron Monte Carlo dose calculation and uses the calculated result as input. Distances along ray lines from the distal side of 90% isodose line to distal surface of the PTV are used to estimate the bolus thickness. Inhomogeneities within the calculation volume are accounted for using the coefficient of equivalent thickness method. Several regional modulation operators are applied to improve the dose coverage and uniformity. The process is iterated (usually twice) until an acceptable MERT plan is realized, and the final bolus is printed using solid polylactic acid. The method is evaluated with regular geometric phantoms, anthropomorphic phantoms, and a clinical rhabdomyosarcoma pediatric case. In all cases the dose conformity are improved compared to that with uniform bolus. For geometric phantoms with air or bone inhomogeneities, the dose homogeneity is markedly improved. The actual printed boluses conform well to the surface of complex anthropomorphic phantoms. The correspondence of the dose distribution between the calculated synthetic bolus and the actual manufactured bolus is shown. For the rhabdomyosarcoma patient, the MERT plan yields a reduction of mean dose by 38.2% in left kidney relative to uniform bolus. MERT using 3D printed bolus appears to be a practical, low-cost approach to generating optimized bolus for electron therapy. The method is effective in improving conformity of the prescription isodose surface and in sparing immediately adjacent normal tissues.", "journal": "Journal of applied clinical medical physics", "date": "2014-09-11", "authors": ["ShiqinSu", "KathrynMoran", "James LRobar"], "doi": "10.1120/jacmp.v15i4.4831"}

Additive manufacturing techniques such as selective laser sintering have been used to successfully manufacture ankle-foot orthoses with controlled stiffness levels. The purpose of this study was to use passive-dynamic ankle-foot orthoses manufactured with selective laser sintering to identify the influence of orthosis stiffness on walking performance in patients with lower-limb neuromuscular and musculoskeletal impairments.\nThirteen subjects with unilateral impairments were enrolled in this study.

Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data and electromyographic data were collected from each subject while they walked overground with each orthosis at their self-selected velocity and a controlled velocity.\nAs the orthosis stiffness decreased, ankle range of motion and medial gastrocnemius activity increased while the knee became more extended throughout stance. Minimal changes in other kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic quantities were observed.\nSubjects effectively compensated for changes in ankle-foot orthosis stiffness with altered gastrocnemius activity, and the stiffness levels analyzed in this study had a minimal effect on overall walking performance.", "journal": "Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)", "date": "2014-09-07", "authors": ["Nicole GHarper", "Elizabeth RussellEsposito", "Jason MWilken", "Richard RNeptune"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2014.07.005"}

A better understanding of axon guidance is critical to functional recovery following injury to the nervous system through improved outgrowth and mapping of damaged nerves. Due to their implications as inhibitors to central nervous system regeneration, we investigated the repulsive properties of semaphorin 6A and ephrin-B3 on E15 rat dorsal root ganglion explants, as well as possible interactions with soluble gradients of chemoattractive nerve growth factor (NGF). We employed a 3D biomimetic in vitro choice point model, which enabled the simple and rapid preparation of patterned gel growth matrices with quantifiable presentation of guidance cues in a specifiable manner that resembles the in vivo presentation of soluble and/or immobilized ligands. Neurites demonstrated an inhibitory response to immobilized Sema6A by lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion explants, while no such repulsion was observed for immobilized ephrin-B3 by explants at any spinal level.

Such phantoms may be inadequate when assessing nonlinear reconstruction or postprocessing algorithms. The purpose of this study was to design anatomically informed textured phantoms and use the phantoms to assess quantum noise properties across two clinically available reconstruction algorithms, filtered back projection (FBP) and sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE).\nTwo phantoms were designed to represent lung and soft-tissue textures. The lung phantom included intricate vessel-like structures along with embedded nodules (spherical, lobulated, and spiculated). The soft tissue phantom was designed based on a three-dimensional clustered lumpy background with included low-contrast lesions (spherical and anthropomorphic). The phantoms were built using rapid prototyping (3D printing) technology and, along with a uniform phantom of similar size, were imaged on a Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash CT scanner and reconstructed with FBP and SAFIRE. Fifty repeated acquisitions were acquired for each background type and noise was assessed by estimating pixel-value statistics, such as standard deviation (i.e., noise magnitude), autocorrelation, and noise power spectrum. Noise stationarity was also assessed by examining the spatial distribution of noise magnitude. The noise properties were compared across background types and between the two reconstruction algorithms.\nIn FBP and SAFIRE images, noise was globally nonstationary for all phantoms. In FBP images of all phantoms, and in SAFIRE images of the uniform phantom, noise appeared to be locally stationary (within a reasonably small region of interest). Noise was locally nonstationary in SAFIRE images of the textured phantoms with edge pixels showing higher noise magnitude compared to pixels in more homogenous regions. For pixels in uniform regions, noise magnitude was reduced by an average of 60% in SAFIRE images compared to FBP. However, for edge pixels, noise magnitude ranged from 20% higher to 40% lower in SAFIRE images compared to FBP. SAFIRE images of the lung phantom exhibited distinct regions with varying noise texture (i.e., noise autocorrelation/power spectra).\nQuantum noise properties observed in uniform phantoms may not be representative of those in actual patients for nonlinear reconstruction algorithms.

In this study, we performed a thorough comparison of normal and hypomaturation enamel through a series of systematical tests on human permanent molars to understand the biomineralization process during pathological amelogenesis. The results of microcomputed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy, microzone X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, energy diffraction spectrum and Vickers microhardness testing together show dramatic contrasts between hypomaturation enamel and normal enamel in terms of their hierarchical structures, spectral features, crystallographic characteristics, thermodynamic behavior, mineral distribution and mechanical property. Our current study highlights the importance of the organic matrix during the amelogenesis process. It is found that the retention of the organic matrix will influence the quantity, quality and distribution of mineral crystals, which will further demolish the hierarchical architecture of the enamel and affect the related mechanical property. In addition, the high carbonate content in hypomaturation enamel influences the crystallinity, crystal size and solubility of hydroxyapatite crystals.

We present our procedure here.\nMultidetector-row computed tomography images of anatomical structures were digitally segmented using the original software \"PLUTO,\" which was developed at the Graduate School of Information Science, Nagoya University. After converting the final segmentation data to stereolithography files, a 3D printed liver at a 70 % scale was produced.

Sodium alginate and calcium chloride are used as the gel precursor and gel reactant solution to form cell-laden alginate microspheres. It is found that the effects of gelation depend on the duration of gelation. Two-minute gelation is observed to increase the cell viability after 24 h incubation, mainly due to the protective cushion effect of the forming gel membrane during droplet landing. Despite the cushion effect from 10 min gelation, it is observed that the cell viability decreases after 24 h incubation because of the forming thick gel membrane that reduces nutrient and oxygen diffusion from the culture medium.

An as-deposited octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayer (OTS SAM) on TiO2 was found to be hydrophobic and stably adsorbed serum albumins that blocked subsequent adsorption of other proteins and cells. Upon irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light, OTS molecules were decomposed and became permissive to the adhesion of PC12 cells via adsorption of an extracellular matrix protein, collagen. Optimal UV dose was 200 J cm(-2) for OTS SAM on TiO2. The amount of collagen adsorption decreased when excessive UV light was irradiated, most likely due to the surface being too hydrophilic to support its adsorption. This UV-induced modification required TiO2 to be present under the SAM and hence is a result of TiO2 photocatalysis. The UV irradiation for surface modification can be performed before cell plating or during cell culture. We also demonstrate that poly(ethylene glycol) SAM can also be patterned with this method, indicating that it is applicable to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic SAMs. This method provides a unique tool for fabricating cell microarrays and studying dynamical properties of living cells.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-08-08", "authors": ["HideakiYamamoto", "TakanoriDemura", "MayuMorita", "ShoKono", "KoheiSekine", "TakahiroShinada", "ShunNakamura", "TakashiTanii"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/3/035021"}

The objective of this study is to create novel three-dimensional (3D) printed osteochondral scaffolds with both excellent interfacial mechanical properties and biocompatibility for facilitating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) growth and chondrogenic differentiation. For this purpose, we designed and 3D printed a series of innovative bi-phasic 3D models that mimic the osteochondral region of articulate joints. Our mechanical testing results showed that our bi-phasic scaffolds with key structures have enhanced mechanical characteristics in compression (a maximum Young's modulus of 31\u2009MPa) and shear (a maximum fracture strength of 5768\u2009N/mm(2)) when compared with homogenous designs. These results are also correlated with numerical simulation. In order to improve their biocompatibility, the scaffolds' surfaces were further modified with acetylated collagen (one of the main components in osteochondral extracellular matrix). MSC proliferation results demonstrated that incorporation of a collagen, along with biomimetically designed micro-features, can greatly enhance MSC growth after 5 days in vitro.

However, the traditional prostheses are not designed speci\ufb01cally for use in the thoracic cavity, sometimes resulting in failure of treatment for many reasons. The aim of our study was to develop a novel prosthesis to promote prevention or treatment of late postpneumonectomy complications.\nUsing 3D printing technology, we created a novel mimetic lung model replicating the native one and then transplanted it into the thoracic cavity of postpneumonectomy dogs to maintain the original position of the mediastinum. Postoperative morbidity and mortality of late complications were compared between transplanted and non-transplanted groups. The safety and feasibility of implanting a 3D printed prosthesis were also evaluated by chest computed tomography (CT) scan and pathological examination.\nAt the 1-year follow-up, pneumonectomy dogs with 3D printed lungs showed less morbidity and mortality of late complications. CT images indicated dynamic mediastinal shift in pneumonectomy-only dogs with enlarged contralateral lungs. Nevertheless, there was no obvious change in the position of the mediastinum in 3D printed lung transplanted individuals. Moreover, the 3D printed lungs did not cause any additional side effects and revealed good histocompatibility and tolerance of recipients.\nOur experiences indicated the safety, feasibility and efficacy of transplantation with 3D printed lungs for prevention of late postpneumonectomy complications and provided a practical and possibly unique clinical application of 3D printing technology for surgical therapy.", "journal": "European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery", "date": "2014-08-02", "authors": ["XiaojunLi", "HuiCai", "XiaohaiCui", "PeilongCao", "JingZhang", "GangLi", "JiaZhang"], "doi": "10.1093/ejcts/ezu296"}

{"title": "Three-dimensional printing of freeform helical microstructures: a review.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a fabrication method that enables creation of structures from digital models. Among the different structures fabricated by 3D printing methods, helical microstructures attracted the attention of the researchers due to their potential in different fields such as MEMS, lab-on-a-chip systems, microelectronics and telecommunications. Here we review different types of 3D printing methods capable of fabricating 3D freeform helical microstructures. The techniques including two more common microfabrication methods (i.e., focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography) and also five methods based on computer-controlled robotic direct deposition of ink filament (i.e., fused deposition modeling, meniscus-confined electrodeposition, conformal printing on a rotating mandrel, UV-assisted and solvent-cast 3D printings) and their advantages and disadvantages regarding their utilization for the fabrication of helical microstructures are discussed. Focused ion beam chemical vapour deposition and microstereolithography techniques enable the fabrication of very precise shapes with a resolution down to \u223c100 nm. However, these techniques may have material constraints (e.g., low viscosity) and/or may need special process conditions (e.g., vacuum chamber) and expensive equipment. The five other techniques based on robotic extrusion of materials through a nozzle are relatively cost-effective, however show lower resolution and less precise features. The popular fused deposition modeling method offers a wide variety of printable materials but the helical microstructures manufactured featured a less precise geometry compared to the other printing methods discussed in this review. The UV-assisted and the solvent-cast 3D printing methods both demonstrated high performance for the printing of 3D freeform structures such as the helix shape. However, the compatible materials used in these methods were limited to UV-curable polymers and polylactic acid (PLA), respectively. Meniscus-confined electrodeposition is a flexible, low cost technique that is capable of fabricating 3D structures both in nano- and microscales including freeform helical microstructures (down to few microns) under room conditions using metals. However, the metals suitable for this technique are limited to those that can be electrochemically deposited with the use of an electrolyte solution. The highest precision on the helix geometry was achieved using the conformal printing on a rotating mandrel. This method offers the lowest shape deformation after printing but requires more tools (e.g., mandrel, motor) and the printed structure must be separated from the mandrel. Helical microstructures made of multifunctional materials (e.g., carbon nanotube nanocomposites, metallic coated polymer template) were used in different technological applications such as strain/load sensors, cell separators and micro-antennas. These innovative 3D microsystems exploiting the unique helix shape demonstrated their potential for better performance and more compact microsystems.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2014-07-30", "authors": ["R DFarahani", "KChizari", "DTherriault"], "doi": "10.1039/c4nr02041c"}

Therefore, the aim of this study was to design an effective platform for DNA isolation from different species of microorganisms as well as the amplification of mecA gene that encodes the resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotic formation and is contained in MRSA. For this purpose, we fabricated 3D-printed chip that was suitable for bacterial cultivation, DNA isolation, PCR, and detection of amplified gene using gold nanoparticle (AuNP) probes as an indicator of MRSA. Confirmation of the MRSA presence in the samples was based on a specific interaction between mecA gene with the AuNP probes and a colorimetric detection, which utilized the noncross-linking aggregation phenomenon of DNA-functionalized AuNPs. To test the whole system, we analyzed several real refractive indexes, in which two of them were positively scanned to find the presence of mecA gene. The aggregation of AuNP probes were reflected by 75% decrease of absorbance (\u03bb = 530 nm) and change in AuNPs size from 3 \u00b1 0.05 to 4 \u00b1 0.05 nm (n = 5).

Herein, we introduce a new approach using 3D printing to simplify and improve the fabrication of human heart valve scaffolds by tissue engineering (TE). Custom-made human heart valve scaffolds are to be fabricated on a selective laser-sintering 3D printer for subsequent seeding with vascular cells from human umbilical cords. The scaffolds will be produced from resorbable polymers that must feature a number of specific properties: the structure, i.e. particle granularity and shape, and thermic properties must be feasible for the printing process. They must be suitable for the cell-seeding process and at the same time should be resorbable. They must be applicable for implementation in the human body and flexible enough to support the full functionality of the valve. The research focuses mainly on the search for a suitable scaffold material that allows the implementation of both the printing process to produce the scaffolds and the cell-seeding process, while meeting all of the above requirements. Computer tomographic data from patients were transformed into a 3D data model suitable for the 3D printer. Our current activities involve various aspects of the printing process, material research and the implementation of the cell-seeding process. Different resorbable polymeric materials have been examined and used to fabricate heart valve scaffolds by rapid manufacturing. Human vascular cells attached to the scaffold surface should migrate additionally into the inner structure of the polymeric samples. The ultimate intention of our approach is to establish a heart valve fabrication process based on 3D rapid manufacturing and TE. Based on the computer tomographic data of a patient, a custom-made scaffold for a valve will be produced on a 3D printer and populated preferably by autologous cells.

Recently, hepatic differentiation of hESCs in 3D configuration with better mimicry of embryonic liver development represents incremental efforts to improve the differentiation efficiency and cellular maturation. However, most of the present 3D differentiation configurations involved interruptive operations during the multi-staged differentiation process, which might impose unwanted influence on cellular differentiation. Most of the current researches resulted in generation of hepatocytes with high expression of AFP, which is minimally expressed in primary hepatocytes. Here, off-the-shelf micro-stencil arrays are developed to generate adherent multilayered colonies composed of hESCs-derived cells. Uninterrupted cellular differentiation and proliferation is achieved to recapitulate the continuous and multi-stage liver development. Compared with conventional 2D format, the micro-scaled multilayered colonies with uniform and defined sizes constrained within the microwells are composed of more homogenous and mature hepatocyte-like cells with significantly lowered AFP expression and elevated hepatic functions.

Introducing pores into an implant will lower the modulus significantly. Three dimensional printing (3DP) is capable of producing parts with dual porosity features: micropores by process (residual pores from binder burnout) and macropores by design via a computer aided design model. Titanium was chosen due to its excellent biocompatibility, superior corrosion resistance, durability, osteointegration capability, relatively low elastic modulus, and high strength to weight ratio. The mechanical and physical properties of 3DP titanium were studied and compared to the properties of bone. The mechanical and physical properties were tailored by varying the binder (polyvinyl alcohol) content and the sintering temperature of the titanium samples. The fabricated titanium samples had a porosity of 32.2-53.4% and a compressive modulus of 0.86-2.48 GPa, within the range of cancellous bone modulus.

{"title": "Dynamic bowtie filter for cone-beam/multi-slice CT.", "abstract": "A pre-patient attenuator (\"bowtie filter\" or \"bowtie\") is used to modulate an incoming x-ray beam as a function of the angle of the x-ray with respect to a patient to balance the photon flux on a detector array. While the current dynamic bowtie design is focused on fan-beam geometry, in this study we propose a methodology for dynamic bowtie design in multi-slice/cone-beam geometry. The proposed 3D dynamic bowtie is an extension of the 2D prior art. The 3D bowtie consists of a highly attenuating bowtie (HB) filled in with heavy liquid and a weakly attenuating bowtie (WB) immersed in the liquid of the HB. The HB targets a balanced flux distribution on a detector array when no object is in the field of view (FOV). The WB compensates for an object in the FOV, and hence is a scaled-down version of the object. The WB is rotated and translated in synchrony with the source rotation and patient translation so that the overall flux balance is maintained on the detector array. First, the mathematical models of different scanning modes are established for an elliptical water phantom. Then, a numerical simulation study is performed to compare the performance of the scanning modes in the cases of the water phantom and a patient cross-section without any bowtie and with a dynamic bowtie. The dynamic bowtie can equalize the numbers of detected photons in the case of the water phantom. In practical cases, the dynamic bowtie can effectively reduce the dynamic range of detected signals inside the FOV. Furthermore, the WB can be individualized using a 3D printing technique as the gold standard. We have extended the dynamic bowtie concept from 2D to 3D by using highly attenuating liquid and moving a scale-reduced negative copy of an object being scanned. Our methodology can be applied to reduce radiation dose and facilitate photon-counting detection.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-07-23", "authors": ["FenglinLiu", "QingsongYang", "WenxiangCong", "GeWang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0103054"}

{"title": "Biofabrication of tissue constructs by 3D bioprinting of cell-laden microcarriers.", "abstract": "Bioprinting allows the fabrication of living constructs with custom-made architectures by spatially controlled deposition of multiple bioinks. This is important for the generation of tissue, such as osteochondral tissue, which displays a zonal composition in the cartilage domain supported by the underlying subchondral bone. Challenges in fabricating functional grafts of clinically relevant size include the incorporation of cues to guide specific cell differentiation and the generation of sufficient cells, which is hard to obtain with conventional cell culture techniques. A novel strategy to address these demands is to combine bioprinting with microcarrier technology. This technology allows for the extensive expansion of cells, while they form multi-cellular aggregates, and their phenotype can be controlled. In this work, living constructs were fabricated via bioprinting of cell-laden microcarriers. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-laden polylactic acid microcarriers, obtained via static culture or spinner flask expansion, were encapsulated in gelatin methacrylamide-gellan gum bioinks, and the printability of the composite material was studied. This bioprinting approach allowed for the fabrication of constructs with high cell concentration and viability. Microcarrier encapsulation improved the compressive modulus of the hydrogel constructs, facilitated cell adhesion, and supported osteogenic differentiation and bone matrix deposition by MSCs.

In the presence of 100\u00a0\u03bcm polyP\u00b7Ca(2+)-complex, the cells proliferate with a generation time of approximately 47-55\u00a0h. In addition, the hardness of the alginate/gelatin hydrogel substantially increases in the presence of the polymer. The reduced Young's modulus for the alginate/gelatin hydrogel is approximately 13-14\u00a0kPa, and this value drops to approximately 0.5\u00a0kPa after incubation of the cell containing scaffolds for 5\u00a0d.

Creating a three-dimensional (3D) model from two-dimensional (2D) imaging data by rapid prototyping has been used in industrial design for decades but has only recently been introduced for medical application. 3D printing is one such technique that is fast, convenient, and relatively affordable. In this report, we present a case in which a reproducible method for producing a 3D-printed \"reverse model\" representing a skin wound defect was used for flap design and harvesting. This comprised a 82-year-old man with an exposed ankle prosthesis after serial soft tissue debridements for wound infection. Soft tissue coverage and dead-space filling were planned with a composite radial forearm free flap (RFFF). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the donor site (left forearm), recipient site (right ankle), and the left ankle was performed. 2D data from the CTA was 3D-reconstructed using computer software, with a 3D image of the left ankle used as a \"control.\" A 3D model was created by superimposing the left and right ankle images, to create a \"reverse image\" of the defect, and printed using a 3D printer. The RFFF was thus planned and executed effectively, without complication. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mechanism of calculating a soft tissue wound defect and producing a 3D model that may be useful for surgical planning. 3D printing and particularly \"reverse\" modeling may be versatile options in reconstructive planning, and have the potential for broad application.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2014-07-22", "authors": ["Michael PChae", "FrankLin", "Robert TSpychal", "David JHunter-Smith", "Warren MatthewRozen"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22293"}

However, highly porous scaffolds suffer from having poor mechanical strength. Previously, we showed that microwave sintering could successfully be used to improve mechanical strength of macro porous tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffolds.

We have used direct three dimensional printing (3DP) technology for scaffold fabrication. These 3DP scaffolds possessed multiscale porosity, that is, 3D interconnected designed macro pores along with intrinsic micro pores. A significant increase in mechanical strength, between 37 and 41%, was achieved due to SrO and MgO doping in TCP as compared with pure TCP. Maximum compressive strengths of 9.38\u2009\u00b1\u20091.86 MPa and 12.01\u2009\u00b1\u20091.56 MPa were achieved by conventional and microwave sintering, respectively, for SrO-MgO-doped 3DP scaffolds with 500 \u03bcm designed pores. Histomorphological and histomorphometric analysis revealed a significantly higher osteoid, bone and haversian canal formation induced by the presence of SrO and MgO dopants in 3DP TCP as compared with pure TCP scaffolds when tested in rabbit femoral condyle defect model.

Cysteines in the internal cavity of the engineered caged protein scaffold (E2 variant D381C) were conjugated with maleimide-bearing Alexa Fluor 532 (AF532) and doxorubicin (DOX).

The resulting bi-functional nanoparticles remained intact and correctly assembled. The uptake of FA-displaying nanoparticles (D381C-AF532-PEG-FA) by cells overexpressing the folate receptor was approximately six times greater than of non-targeting nanoparticles (D381C-AF532-PEG) and was confirmed to be FA-specific.

Autologous reconstruction remains the standard of care for these cases. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) therapy has proven its clinical utility, although non-targeted adverse events occur due to the high milligram-level doses used. Ongoing efforts explore the use of different growth factors, cytokines, or chemokines, as well as co-therapy to augment healing.\nHere we utilize inkjet-based biopatterning to load acellular DermaMatrix delivery matrices with nanogram-level doses of BMP-2, stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b2 (SDF-1\u03b2), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), or co-therapies thereof. We tested the hypothesis that bioprinted SDF-1\u03b2 co-delivery enhances BMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21-driven osteogenesis both in-vitro and in-vivo using a mouse calvarial critical size defect (CSD) model.\nOur data showed that BMP-2 bioprinted in low-doses induced significant new bone formation by four weeks post-operation. TGF-\u03b21 was less effective compared to BMP-2, and SDF-1\u03b2 therapy did not enhance osteogenesis above control levels. However, co-delivery of BMP-2+SDF-1\u03b2 was shown to augment BMP-2-induced bone formation compared to BMP-2 alone. In contrast, co-delivery of TGF-\u03b21+SDF-1\u03b2 decreased bone healing compared to TGF-\u03b21 alone. This was further confirmed in vitro by osteogenic differentiation studies using MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts.\nOur data indicates that sustained release delivery of a low-dose growth factor therapy using biopatterning technology can aid in healing CSD injuries. SDF-1\u03b2 augments the ability for BMP-2 to drive healing, a result confirmed in vivo and in vitro; however, because SDF-1\u03b2 is detrimental to TGF-\u03b21-driven osteogenesis, its effect on osteogenesis is not universal.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2014-07-13", "authors": ["SamuelHerberg", "GalinaKondrikova", "SudharsanPeriyasamy-Thandavan", "R NicoleHowie", "Mohammed EElsalanty", "LeeWeiss", "PhilCampbell", "William DHill", "James JCray"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2014.07.007"}

A topology optimization method in designing patient-specific craniofacial implants has been developed to ensure adequate load transfer mechanism and restore the form and function of the mid-face. Patient-specific finite element models are used to design these implants and to validate whether they are viable for physiological loading such as mastication. Validation of these topology optimized finite element models using mechanical testing is a critical step. Instead of inserting the implants into a cadaver or patient, we embed the implants into the computer-aided skull model of a patient and, fuse them together to 3D print the complete skull model with the implant. Masticatory forces are applied in the molar region to simulate chewing and measure the stress-strain trajectory. Until recently, strain gages have been used to measure strains for validation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method is a relatively new technique for full-field strain measurement which provides a continuous deformation field data. The main objective of this study is to validate the finite element model of patient-specific craniofacial implants against the strain data from the DIC obtained during the mastication simulation and show that the optimized shapes provide adequate load-transfer mechanism. Patient-specific models are obtained from CT scans. The principal maximum and minimum strains are compared. The computational and experimental approach to designing patient-specific implants proved to be a viable technique for mid-face craniofacial reconstruction.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2014-07-06", "authors": ["AlokSutradhar", "JaejongPark", "DianaCarrau", "Michael JMiller"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.06.002"}

This paper presents a method to fabricate microscale polyacrylamide features embedded in a second hydrogel of a different composition. An electrohydrodynamic jet (e-jet) printer was used to pattern hemispherical droplets of polyacrylamide prepolymer on a passive substrate. After photopolymerization, the droplets were backfilled with a second polyacrylamide mixture, the second mixture was polymerized and the sample was peeled off the substrate. Fluorescent and confocal microscopy confirmed multimaterial patterning, while scanning probe microscopy revealed a patterned topography with printed spots forming shallow wells. Finite element modeling was used to understand the mechanics of the formation of the topographical features during backfill and subsequent polymerization. Finally, polyacrylamide containing acrylic acid was used to demonstrate two applications of the micropatterned hydrogels: stimuli-responsive materials and patterned substrates for cell culture.

{"title": "Biocalcite, a multifunctional inorganic polymer: Building block for calcareous sponge spicules and bioseed for the synthesis of calcium phosphate-based bone.", "abstract": "Calcium carbonate is the material that builds up the spicules of the calcareous sponges. Recent results revealed that the calcium carbonate/biocalcite-based spicular skeleton of these animals is formed through an enzymatic mechanism, such as the skeleton of the siliceous sponges, evolutionarily the oldest animals that consist of biosilica. The enzyme that mediates the calcium carbonate deposition has been identified as a carbonic anhydrase (CA) and has been cloned from the calcareous sponge species Sycon raphanus. Calcium carbonate deposits are also found in vertebrate bones besides the main constituent, calcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (HA). Evidence has been presented that during the initial phase of HA synthesis poorly crystalline carbonated apatite is deposited. Recent data summarized here indicate that during early bone formation calcium carbonate deposits enzymatically formed by CA, act as potential bioseeds for the precipitation of calcium phosphate mineral onto bone-forming osteoblasts. Two different calcium carbonate phases have been found during CA-driven enzymatic calcium carbonate deposition in in vitro assays: calcite crystals and round-shaped vaterite deposits. The CA provides a new target of potential anabolic agents for treatment of bone diseases; a first CA activator stimulating the CA-driven calcium carbonate deposition has been identified. In addition, the CA-driven calcium carbonate crystal formation can be frozen at the vaterite state in the presence of silintaphin-2, an aspartic acid/glutamic acid-rich sponge-specific protein. The discovery that calcium carbonate crystals act as bioseeds in human bone formation may allow the development of novel biomimetic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.

{"title": "Effect of cold storage on collagen-based hydrogels for the three-dimensional culture of adipose-derived stem cells.", "abstract": "Collagen gels have been extensively used as three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems. To enhance their mechanical properties, the manufacture of collagen-based gels with agarose has been proposed. However, little is known about the stability of these gels under cold storage conditions. The consequences of cold storage on biological tissues for clinical applications are known to be significant; yet, they have not been considered on hydrogels used for in vitro experiments. This work studies the effect of extended cold storage on the stability of collagen and collagen-agarose hydrogels using rheometry and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, cell-matrix interactions of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) have been studied using these gels. Results show that both the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G\u2033) of pure collagen gels gradually decrease with extended cold storage along the 30 days of the study, while G' and G\u2033 increase in collagen-agarose gels under the same conditions. Moreover, significant changes in both moduli of collagen-agarose gels were only found after 30 days of cold storage, while in the case of collagen gels significant changes were already detected after 7 days. Finally, a reduction in the ability of ADSC to remodel the gel after prolonged cold storage was observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proving that cold storage of hydrogels prior to cell culture might have a significant impact on their mechanical properties and cell-matrix interactions.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-07-06", "authors": ["AnaSancho", "LexuriV\u00e1zquez", "Elena MDe-Juan-Pardo"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/3/035017"}

Our method builds upon a previous vacuum-assisted method used for micromolding (Jeon et al 1999 Adv.

Vacuum-patterned substrates were subsequently used to culture mammalian PC12 and fibroblast cells and amphibian neurons. Cells were also patterned directly by injecting cell suspensions into microchannels using vacuum. Fibroblast and neuronal cells patterned using vacuum showed normal growth and minimal cell death indicating no adverse effects of vacuum on cells. Our method fills reversibly sealed PDMS microchannels. This enables the user to remove the PDMS microchannel cast and access the patterned biomaterial or cells for further experimental purposes.

An intuitive demonstration of a biological machine is one that can produce motion in response to controllable external signaling. Whereas cardiac cell-driven biological actuators have been demonstrated, the requirements of these machines to respond to stimuli and exhibit controlled movement merit the use of skeletal muscle, the primary generator of actuation in animals, as a contractile power source. Here, we report the development of 3D printed hydrogel \"bio-bots\" with an asymmetric physical design and powered by the actuation of an engineered mammalian skeletal muscle strip to result in net locomotion of the bio-bot. Geometric design and material properties of the hydrogel bio-bots were optimized using stereolithographic 3D printing, and the effect of collagen I and fibrin extracellular matrix proteins and insulin-like growth factor 1 on the force production of engineered skeletal muscle was characterized. Electrical stimulation triggered contraction of cells in the muscle strip and net locomotion of the bio-bot with a maximum velocity of \u223c 156 \u03bcm s(-1), which is over 1.5 body lengths per min. Modeling and simulation were used to understand both the effect of different design parameters on the bio-bot and the mechanism of motion.

These include biocompatible patient-specific scaffolds and matrices, osteogenic cells and osteoinductive and angioinductive growth factors. At present, modern 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software and additive manufacturing technology enable patient-specific scaffold and matrix manufacturing. The scaffold, matrix or implant replaces the missing part of the jaw and allows osteogenic cells to generate bone accordingly and allows anatomic and symmetrical restoration. An increasing number of studies, both experimental and clinical, have been published that show bone formation in mandible defects after reconstruction with matrix-osteogenic cell combination. Ideally, matrix (bone substitute material) should be biocompatible, bioresorbable, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, structurally similar to bone, easy to use, cost-effective and nonanimal derived.\nIt is still unknown which type of osteogenic cell is the most efficient.

This report details how additive manufacturing or three-dimensional (3D) printing allows the creation of reproductions of prosected human cadaver and other anatomical specimens that obviates many of the above issues.

The application of 3D printing to produce models of negative spaces, contrast CT radiographic data using segmentation software is illustrated.

Such computer-controlled methods assemble 3D objects by layer-wise deposition or layer-wise cross-linking of materials. They use, for example, nozzle-based deposition of hydrogels and cells, drop-on-demand inkjet-printing of cell suspensions with subsequent cross-linking, layer-by-layer cross-linking of synthetic or biological polymers by selective irradiation with light and even laser-induced deposition of single cells. The need of vessel-like structures has become increasingly crucial for the supply of encapsulated cells for 3D tissue engineering, or even with regard to future application such as vascular grafts.

The results showed that these cellular structures with porosities of 88-58% had compressive strength and elastic modulus in the range 10-300MPa and 0.5-15GPa, respectively. The compressive strength and deformation behavior of these meshes were determined by the coupling of the buckling and bending deformation of struts. Meshes that were dominated by buckling deformation showed relatively high collapse strength and were prone to exhibit brittle characteristics in their stress-strain curves. For meshes dominated by bending deformation, the elastic deformation corresponded well to the Gibson-Ashby model. By enhancing the effect of bending deformation, the stress-strain curve characteristics can change from brittle to ductile (the smooth plateau area).

As a result, individualised planning for both surgical and percutaneous procedures is crucial for procedural optimisation. Three dimensional (3D) rapid prototyping techniques are being utilised to aid operators in planning structural heart procedures.\nWe intend to provide a description of 3D printing as a clinically applicable heart modelling technology for the planning of percutaneous structural heart procedures as well as to report our first clinical use of a 3D printed patient-specific heart model in preparation for a percutaneous mitral annuloplasty using the Mitralign percutaneous annuloplasty system.\nRetrospectively gated, contrast enhanced, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) scans were obtained. MSCT DICOM data was analysed using software that creates 3D surface files of the blood volume of specific regions of interest in the heart. The surface files are rendered using a software package that creates a solid model that can be printed using commercially available stereolithography machines.\nThe technique of direct percutaneous mitral annuloplasty requires advancement of a guiding catheter through the aorta, into the left ventricle, and requires the positioning of the tip of the catheter between the papillary muscles in close proximity to the mitral annulus. The 3D heart model was used to create a procedural plan to optimise potential device implantation. The size of the deflectable guiding catheter was selected on the basis of the patient's heart model. Target locations for annulus crossing wires were evaluated pre-procedurally using the individual patient's 3D heart model. In addition, the ability to position the Bident Catheter at the appropriate locations under the mitral annulus as well as the manoeuvrability between the papillary muscles were analysed on the heart model, enabling safe completion of the procedure, which resulted in a significant reduction in mitral regurgitation.\n3D printing is a helpful tool in individualised planning for percutaneous structural interventions. Future studies are warranted to assess its role in preparing for percutaneous and surgical heart procedures.", "journal": "Kardiologia polska", "date": "2014-06-26", "authors": ["Rafa\u0142Dankowski", "ArturBaszko", "MichaelSutherland", "LudwikFirek", "PiotrKa\u0142mucki", "KatarzynaWr\u00f3blewska", "AndrzejSzyszka", "AdamGroothuis", "TomaszSiminiak"], "doi": "10.5603/KP.2014.0119"}

This study sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing present-day three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to create high-fidelity synthetic heart models with ventricular septal defect (VSD) lesions and applying these models to a novel, simulation-based educational curriculum for premedical and medical students.\nArchived, de-identified magnetic resonance images of five common VSD subtypes were obtained. These cardiac images were then segmented and built into 3D computer-aided design models using Mimics Innovation Suite software. An Objet500 Connex 3D printer was subsequently utilized to print a high-fidelity heart model for each VSD subtype. Next, a simulation-based educational curriculum using these heart models was developed and implemented in the instruction of 29 premedical and medical students. Assessment of this curriculum was undertaken with Likert-type questionnaires.\nHigh-fidelity VSD models were successfully created utilizing magnetic resonance imaging data and 3D printing. Following instruction with these high-fidelity models, all students reported significant improvement in knowledge acquisition (P < .0001), knowledge reporting (P < .0001), and structural conceptualization (P < .0001) of VSDs.\nIt is feasible to use present-day 3D printing technology to create high-fidelity heart models with complex intracardiac defects.

These metals and fabrication strategies were looked at from the point of view of standard-of-care implants for the mandible. These implants are used as part of the treatment for segmental resection due to oropharyngeal cancer, injury or correction of deformity due to pathology or congenital defect. The focus of this two-part review is the issues associated with the failure of existing mandibular implants that are due to mismatched material properties. Potential directions for future research are also studied. To mitigate these issues, the use of low-stiffness metallic alloys has been highlighted. To this end, the development, processing and biocompatibility of superelastic NiTi as well as resorbable magnesium-based alloys are discussed. Additionally, engineered porosity is reviewed as it can be an effective way of matching the stiffness of an implant with the surrounding tissue. These porosities and the overall geometry of the implant can be optimized for strain transduction and with a tailored stiffness profile.

{"title": "[Fixation of acetabular fractures. a novel method of pre-operative Omega plate contouring].", "abstract": "The aim of the study was to describe a novel Omega plate and the procedure for obtaining an accurate pelvic inlet view, the mode of pre-operative plate contouring, the surgical procedure used and the evaluation of results in the first 15 patients treated using this method.\nIn the period 2009-2011, a total of 232 patients underwent osteosynthesis for pelvic fractures. Out of them, 52 were treated by the modified Stoppa approach and 12 with the original Omega plate. Between July 2010 and January 2014, a novel 3.5-mm Omega plate was used in 12 men and 3 women. The average duration of follow-up was 8.5 months in 11 patients; four were shortly after surgery. The multi-functional Omega plate is described in detail. An exact pelvic inlet projection, named the \"computer tomography-defined (CTD) view\", was based on pre-operative CT examination. It facilitates pre-operative contouring of the plate according to a mirror image of the uninjured half of the pelvis. The surgical procedure enables us to apply the contoured plate to the correct position; the plate completes reduction, restores normal pelvic anatomy and makes operative time shorter. The radiographic evaluation of post-operative results was done using the Matta classification and functional outcome was assessed by the Harris Hip Score.\nSurgery using the isolated Stoppa approach was carried out in 11 patients and a procedure combining the Stoppa approach with another method was used in four patients. All operations were successfully completed, during two of them the external iliac vein was injured and treated by vascular suturing. No other vascular or nerve injury occurred. One deep wound infection successfully healed was recorded. The post-operative radiographic results were excellent or satisfactory in 12 and poor in three patients. At follow-ups of 6 to 12 months, no failure of fracture reduction or osteosynthesis was recorded in 11 patients. Neither avascular necrosis of the femoral head nor heterotopic ossification was found. One patient showed signs of post-injury arthritis at 6 months after surgery. The functional result assessed by the Harris Hip Score was excellent in seven patients, good in two (one of them with gonarthrosis), satisfactory in one patient with contralateral total hip replacement and ipsilateral gonarthrosis, and poor in one patient with hemiparesis after a stroke.\nShape and size variability in CTD pelvic inlet views do not allow us to create a unified anatomically correct implant. Contouring during the operative procedure may not be accurate enough and significantly prolongs the time of surgery. Therefore, a custom-made plate for each patient seems to be an optimal method. It has been demonstrated on a group of 50 patients that CTD images of the right and left halves of the pelvis are identical in 68% and very similar (variation in length up to 5 mm and in curvature up to 3 mm) in 18%. At present plate contouring according to a mirror image of the acetabulum, which will be obtained by 3D printing, is prepared.\nPre-operative contouring of an Omega plate based on a post-injury CT scan of the uninjured half of the pelvis is over 80% accurate or almost accurate. The multi-functional 3.5-mm pelvic plate Omega allows us to stabilise complicated fractures of the superior ramus of the pubic bone, anterior acetabular column or quadrilateral plate as well as fractures above the linea arcuata or uncomplicated fractures of the posterior column. The stabilisation of all fragments of the anterior column and quadrilateral plate is very firm and the Omega plate is resistant to fragment redisplacement.

{"title": "Numerical optimization of open-porous bone scaffold structures to match the elastic properties of human cortical bone.", "abstract": "Treatment of large segmental bone defects, especially in load bearing areas, is a complex procedure in orthopedic surgery. The usage of additive manufacturing processes enables the creation of customized bone implants with arbitrary open-porous structure satisfying both the mechanical and the biological requirements for a sufficient bone ingrowth. Aim of the present numerical study was to optimize the geometrical parameters of open-porous titanium scaffolds to match the elastic properties of human cortical bone with respect to an adequate pore size. Three different scaffold designs (cubic, diagonal and pyramidal) were numerically investigated by using an optimization approach. Beam elements were used to create the lattice structures of the scaffolds. The design parameters strut diameter and pore size ranged from 0.2 to 1.5mm and from 0 to 3.0mm, respectively. In a first optimization step, the geometrical parameters were varied under uniaxial compression to obtain a structural modulus of 15GPa (Young\u05f3s modulus of cortical bone) and a pore size of 800\u00b5m was aimed to enable cell ingrowth. Furthermore, the mechanical behavior of the optimized structures under bending and torsion was investigated. Results for bending modulus were between 9.0 and 14.5GPa. In contrast, shear modulus was lowest for cubic and pyramidal design of approximately 1GPa. Here, the diagonal design revealed a modulus of nearly 20GPa. In a second step, large-sized bone scaffolds were created and placed in a biomechanical loading situation within a 30mm segmental femoral defect, stabilized with an osteosynthesis plate and loaded with physiological muscle forces. Strut diameter for the 17 sections of each scaffold was optimized independently in order to match the biomechanical stability of intact bone. For each design, highest strut diameter was found at the dorsal/medial site of the defect and smallest strut diameter in the center. In conclusion, we demonstrated the possibility of providing optimized open-porous scaffolds for bone regeneration by considering both mechanical and biological aspects. Furthermore, the results revealed the need of the investigation and comparison of different load scenarios (compression, bending and torsion) as well as complex biomechanical loading for a profound characterization of different scaffold designs. The usage of a numerical optimization process was proven to be a feasible tool to reduce the amount of the required titanium material without influencing the biomechanical performance of the scaffold negatively.

{"title": "3D volumetric analysis for planning breast reconstructive surgery.", "abstract": "Breast reconstruction plays an integral role in the holistic management of breast cancer, with assessment of breast volume, shape, and projection vital in planning breast reconstruction surgery. Current practice includes two-dimensional (2D) photography and visual estimation in selecting ideal volume and shape of breast implants or soft-tissue flaps. Other objective quantitative means of calculating breast volume have been reported, such as direct anthropomorphic measurements or three-dimensional (3D) photography, but none have proven reliably accurate. We describe a novel approach to volumetric analysis of the breast, through the creation of a haptic, tactile model, or 3D print of scan data. This approach comprises use of a single computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for volumetric analysis, which we use to compare to simpler estimation techniques, create software-generated 3D reconstructions, calculate, and visualize volume differences, and produce biomodels of the breasts using a 3D printer for tactile appreciation of volume differential. Using the technique described, parenchymal volume was assessed and calculated using CT data. A case report was utilized in a pictorial account of the technique, in which a volume difference of 116 cm(3) was calculated, aiding reconstructive planning. Preoperative planning, including volumetric analysis can be used as a tool to aid esthetic outcomes and attempt to reduce operative times in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction surgery.

An efficient DNA assembly method is particularly important for high-throughput, automated DNA assembly in biofabrication facilities and therefore we investigated one-step, scarless DNA assembly via ligase cycling reaction (LCR). LCR assembly uses single-stranded bridging oligos complementary to the ends of neighboring DNA parts, a thermostable ligase to join DNA backbones, and multiple denaturation-annealing-ligation temperature cycles to assemble complex DNA constructs. The efficiency of LCR assembly was improved ca. 4-fold using designed optimization experiments and response surface methodology. Under these optimized conditions, LCR enabled one-step assembly of up to 20 DNA parts and up to 20 kb DNA constructs with very few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (<1 per 25 kb) and insertions/deletions (<1 per 50 kb). Experimental comparison of various sequence-independent DNA assembly methods showed that circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) and Gibson isothermal assembly did not enable assembly of more than four DNA parts with more than 50% of clones being correct. Yeast homologous recombination and LCR both enabled reliable assembly of up to 12 DNA parts with 60-100% of individual clones being correct, but LCR assembly provides a much faster and easier workflow than yeast homologous recombination.

For a given pitch, both bumpy and cavity surfaces exhibit similar static contact angles, which increase as the roughness ratio increases. Notably, the observed water contact angles are shown to be consistently larger than the calculated Wenzel angles, attributable to the pinning of the water droplets into the metastable wetting states. Optical microscopy reveals that the contact lines on both the bumpy and cavity surfaces are distorted by the microtextures, pinning at the lead edges of the bumps and cavities. Vibration of the sessile droplets on the smooth, bumpy, and cavity PDMS surfaces results in the same contact angle, from 110\u00b0-124\u00b0 to \u223c91\u00b0. The results suggest that all three surfaces have the same stable wetting states after vibration and that water droplets pin in the smooth area of the rough PDMS surfaces. This conclusion is supported by visual inspection of the contact lines before and after vibration. The importance of pinning location rather than surface energy on the contact angle is discussed. The dewetting of the water droplet was studied by examining the receding motion of the contact line by evaporating the sessile droplets of a very dilute rhodamine dye solution on these surfaces. The results reveal that the contact line is dragged by the bumps as it recedes, whereas dragging is not visible on the smooth and the cavity surfaces. The drag created by the bumps toward the wetting and dewetting process is also visible in the velocity-dependent advancing and receding contact angle experiments.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2014-06-10", "authors": ["MandakiniKanungo", "SrinivasMettu", "Kock-YeeLaw", "SusanDaniel"], "doi": "10.1021/la404343n"}
{"title": "Simultaneous ECG-gated PET imaging of multiple mice.", "abstract": "We describe and illustrate a method for creating ECG-gated PET images of the heart for each of several mice imaged at the same time. The method is intended to increase \"throughput\" in PET research studies of cardiac dynamics or to obtain information derived from such studies, e.g. tracer concentration in end-diastolic left ventricular blood.\nAn imaging bed with provisions for warming, anesthetic delivery, etc., was fabricated by 3D printing to allow simultaneous PET imaging of two side-by-side mice. After electrode attachment, tracer injection and placement of the animals in the scanner field of view, ECG signals from each animal were continuously analyzed and independent trigger markers generated whenever an R-wave was detected in each signal. PET image data were acquired in \"list\" mode and these trigger markers were inserted into this list along with the image data. Since each mouse is in a different spatial location in the FOV, sorting of these data using trigger markers first from one animal and then the other yields two independent and correctly formed ECG-gated image sequences that reflect the dynamical properties of the heart during an \"average\" cardiac cycle.\nThe described method yields two independent ECG-gated image sequences that exhibit the expected properties in each animal, e.g. variation of the ventricular cavity volumes from maximum to minimum and back during the cardiac cycle in the processed animal with little or no variation in these volumes during the cardiac cycle in the unprocessed animal.\nECG-gated image sequences for each of several animals can be created from a single list mode data collection using the described method. In principle, this method can be extended to more than two mice (or other animals) and to other forms of physiological gating, e.g. respiratory gating, when several subjects are imaged at the same time.", "journal": "Nuclear medicine and biology", "date": "2014-06-10", "authors": ["JurgenSeidel", "Marcelino LBernardo", "Karen JWong", "BiyingXu", "Mark RWilliams", "FrankKuo", "Elaine MJagoda", "FalguniBasuli", "ChanghuiLi", "Gary LGriffiths", "Michael VGreen", "Peter LChoyke"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2014.03.015"}

However, there is a severe shortage of donor organs, and as a result of the increasing demand, the gap between supply and demand continues to widen. A potential solution to this problem is to grow or fabricate organs using biomaterial scaffolds and a person's own cells. Although the realization of this solution has been limited, the development of new biofabrication approaches has made it more realistic. This review provides an overview of natural and synthetic biomaterials that have been used for organ/tissue development. It then discusses past and current biofabrication techniques, with a brief explanation of the state of the art. Finally, the review highlights the need for combining vascularization strategies with current biofabrication techniques.

In this study, the manufacture of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate] (or PHBHHx) scaffolds, by means of an additive manufacturing technique based on a computer-controlled wet-spinning system, was investigated. By optimizing the processing parameters, three-dimensional scaffolds with different internal architectures were fabricated, based on a layer-by-layer approach. The resulting scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, which showed good control over the fibre alignment and a fully interconnected porous network, with porosity in the range 79-88%, fibre diameter 47-76\u2009\u00b5m and pore size 123-789\u2009\u00b5m. Moreover, the resulting fibres presented an internal porosity connected to the external fibre surface as a consequence of the phase-inversion process governing the solidification of the polymer solution. Scaffold compressive modulus and yield stress and strain could be varied in a certain range by changing the architectural parameters. Cell-culture experiments employing the MC3T3-E1 murine pre-osteoblast cell line showed good cell proliferation after 21\u2009days of culture.

However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays.

{"title": "Technical procedures for template-guided surgery for mandibular reconstruction based on digital design and manufacturing.", "abstract": "The occurrence of mandibular defects caused by tumors has been continuously increasing in China in recent years. Conversely, results of the repair of mandibular defects affect the recovery of oral function and patient appearance, and the requirements for accuracy and high surgical quality must be more stringent. Digital techniques--including model reconstruction based on medical images, computer-aided design, and additive manufacturing--have been widely used in modern medicine to improve the accuracy and quality of diagnosis and surgery. However, some special software platforms and services from international companies are not always available for most of researchers and surgeons because they are expensive and time-consuming.\nHere, a new technical solution for guided surgery for the repair of mandibular defects is proposed, based on general popular tools in medical image processing, 3D (3 dimension) model reconstruction, digital design, and fabrication via 3D printing. First, CT (computerized tomography) images are processed to reconstruct the 3D model of the mandible and fibular bone. The defect area is then replaced by healthy contralateral bone to create the repair model. With the repair model as reference, the graft shape and cutline are designed on fibular bone, as is the guide for cutting and shaping. The physical model, fabricated via 3D printing, including surgical guide, the original model, and the repair model, can be used to preform a titanium locking plate, as well as to design and verify the surgical plan and guide. In clinics, surgeons can operate with the help of the surgical guide and preformed plate to realize the predesigned surgical plan.\nWith sufficient communication between engineers and surgeons, an optimal surgical plan can be designed via some common software platforms but needs to be translated to the clinic. Based on customized models and tools, including three surgical guides, preformed titanium plate for fixation, and physical models of the mandible, grafts for defect repair can be cut from fibular bone, shaped with high accuracy during surgery, and fixed with a well-fitting preformed locking plate, so that the predesigned plan can be performed in the clinic and the oral function and appearance of the patient are recovered. This method requires 20% less operating time compared with conventional surgery, and the advantages in cost and convenience are significant compared with those of existing commercial services in China.\nThis comparison between two groups of cases illustrates that, with the proposed method, the accuracy of mandibular defect repair surgery is increased significantly and is less time-consuming, and patients are satisfied with both the recovery of oral function and their appearance. Until now, more than 15 cases have been treated with the proposed methods, so their feasibility and validity have been verified.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2014-06-03", "authors": ["Yun-fengLiu", "Liang-weiXu", "Hui-yongZhu", "Sean Shih-YaoLiu"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-13-63\n10.1016/j.ijom.2008.03.002\n10.1016/j.jcms.2012.11.008\n10.1097/00006534-198907000-00014\n10.1016/j.bjps.2012.10.005\n10.1016/j.bjps.2012.10.003\n10.1016/j.joms.2006.06.306\n10.1016/j.jcms.2012.02.022\n10.1016/j.joms.2009.06.030\n10.1016/j.ajoms.2013.05.003\n10.1111/j.1708-8208.2010.00285.x\n10.1631/jzus.B1000323\n10.1016/S0266-4356(97)90718-X\n10.1016/j.tripleo.2009.05.023\n10.1016/j.joms.2013.02.018\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2010.11.012\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2011.12.006\n10.1002/hed.21922\n10.1016/j.bjoms.2011.11.022\n10.1016/j.joms.2010.06.177\n10.1016/j.joms.2012.08.022\n10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.010\n10.1016/j.ijom.2008.11.026"}

The mandible cutting and registering fixtures were then generated using an additive manufacturing system. The CAMRP calculated the optimal fibula cutting length and number of segments based on the location and length of the defective portion of the mandible. The mandible cutting jig was generated according to the boundary surface of the lesion resection on the mandible STL model. The fibular cutting fixture was based on the length of each segment, and the registered fixture was used to quickly arrange the fibula pieces into the shape of the defect area. In this study, the mandibular lesion was reconstructed using registered fibular sections in one step, and the method is very easy to perform.\nThe application of additive manufacturing technology provided customized models and the cutting fixtures and registered fixtures, which can improve the efficiency of clinical application. This study showed that the cutting fixture helped to rapidly complete lesion resection and fibula cutting, and the registered fixture enabled arrangement of the fibula pieces and allowed completion of the mandible reconstruction in a timely manner. Our method can overcome the disadvantages of traditional surgery, which requires a long and different course of treatment and is liable to cause error. With the help of optimal cutting planning by the CAMRP and the 3D printed mandible resection jig and fibula cutting fixture, this all-in-one process of mandible reconstruction furnishes many benefits in this field by enhancing the accuracy of surgery, shortening the operation duration, reducing the surgical risk, and resulting in a better mandible appearance of the patients after surgery.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2014-06-03", "authors": ["Ming-JuneTsai", "Ching-TsaiWu"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-13-57\n10.1016/S1043-1810(00)80020-2\n10.1016/0007-1226(90)90003-I\n10.1080/02844310802098417\n10.1186/1916-0216-42-40\n10.1097/01.JPS.0000157811.06921.C5\n10.1097/01.prs.0000219076.83890.e8\n10.1016/j.joms.2006.05.067\n10.1097/01.prs.0000233211.54505.9a\n10.1007/s11517-012-0898-4\n10.1111/j.1834-7819.1999.tb00221.x\n10.1016/0278-2391(91)90213-6\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000069709.89719.79\n10.1016/S0278-2391(00)90071-5\n10.1186/1475-925X-12-81\n10.1186/1743-0003-8-1\n10.1186/1475-925X-12-114\n10.1016/j.medengphy.2010.12.015\n10.1080/17452759.2010.527556"}

{"title": "Effect of nano- and micro-scale topological features on alignment of muscle cells and commitment of myogenic differentiation.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle injury can lead to severe motor deficits that adversely affect movement and quality of life. Current surgical treatments for skeletal muscle are hindered by the poor formation of organized myotube bundles at the wound site. Tissue-engineered skeletal muscle constructs to date have been unable to generate high degrees of myotube density and alignment. Generating a suitable in vitro tissue-engineered skeletal muscle construct requires the design of a scaffold that recapitulates the structural combination of nanoscale collagen fibrils and aligned microscale basal lamina tracks present in the native extracellular matrix (ECM). We hypothesized that a 3D aligned tubular porous scaffold containing aligned nanofibers inside the pores can mimic the native muscle tissue environment. We constructed a laminar section of the hypothesized scaffold with aligned chitosan-PCL nanofibers arranged co-axially with the aligned microscale chitosan scaffold bands to mimic the required myogenic environment. A 6-day study of C2C12 mouse myoblast cells cultured on this hybrid scaffold indicated that the nanofibers and scaffold bands in the scaffold played a synergetic role in directing cell orientation, interaction, migration and organization. Our results showed that aligned nanofibers mediated cell alignment and the aligned scaffold bands induced the formation of a more compact assembly of myotube cells as compared to various control substrates including chitosan films, nanofibers, and chitosan bands. The expression levels of both early and late-stage myogenic differentiation genes associated with myogenin and myosin heavy chain, respectively, were higher on the hybrid substrate than on control substrates.

Finally, a third-level HAp layer was achieved by biomimetic mineralization. The three-level hierarchical biomimetic scaffold was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectra, x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the mechanical properties of the scaffold were evaluated using dynamic mechanical analysis. The results show that this scaffold exhibits a similar structure and composition to natural bone tissues. Furthermore, this three-level hierarchical biomimetic scaffold showed enhanced mechanical strength compared with pure porous CaP scaffolds. The biocompatibility and osteoinductivity of the biomimetic scaffolds were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo tests.

In biological tissues, the nonlinear mechanics of fibrous scaffolds contribute to the functionality of the material. The nonlinear mechanical properties of the wavy structure (crimp) in collagen allow tissue flexibility while preventing over-extension. A number of approaches have tried to recreate this complex mechanical functionality. We generated microcrimped fibers by briefly heating electrospun parallel fibers over the glass transition temperature or by ethanol treatment. The crimp structure is similar to those of collagen fibers found in native aorta, intestines, or ligaments. Using poly-L-lactic acid fibers, we demonstrated that the bulk materials exhibit changed stress-strain behaviors with a significant increase in the toe region in correlation to the degree of crimp, similar to those observed in collagenous tissues. In addition to mimicking the stress-strain behavior of biological tissues, the microcrimped fibers are instructive in cell morphology and promote ligament phenotypic gene expression. This effect can be further enhanced by dynamic tensile loading, a physiological perturbation in vivo.

(Sterculiaceae). The reaction temperature played a major role in controlling the size and shell formation of NPs. The amount of NPs synthesized and qualitative characterization was done by UV-vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. TEM studies exhibited controlled dispersity of spherical shaped NPs with an average size of 6.9\u00b10.2nm. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed 'fcc' phase and crystallinity of the particles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the protein-lipid (PL) bilayer that appears as a shell around the Ag core particles. The thermal stability of the Ag-PL NPs was examined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Further analysis was carried out by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), where the spectra provided evidence for the presence of proteins and lipid moieties ((2n-octylcycloprop-1-enyl)-octanoic acid (I)), and their role in synthesis and stabilization of Ag NPs. This is the first report of plant seed assisted synthesis of PL conjugated Ag NPs. These formed Ag-PL NPs showed potential mosquito larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti (L.), Anopheles stephensi Liston and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. These Ag-PL NPs can also act as promising agents in cancer therapy.

When applied on highly porous titanium alloy structures intended for orthopedic bone regeneration purposes, such surface treatments could significantly change the static and fatigue properties of these structures and, thus, affect the application of the biomaterial as bone substitute. Therefore, the interplay between biofunctionalizing surface treatments and mechanical behavior needs to be controlled. In this paper, we studied the effects of two bio-functionalizing surface treatments, namely alkali-acid heat treatment (AlAcH) and acid-alkali (AcAl), on the static and fatigue properties of three different highly porous titanium alloy implants manufactured using selective laser melting. It was found that AlAcH treatment results in minimal mass loss. The static and fatigue properties of AlAcH specimens were therefore not much different from as-manufactured (AsM) specimens. In contrast, AcAl resulted in substantial mass loss and also in significantly less static and fatigue properties particularly for porous structures with the highest porosity. The ratio of the static mechanical properties of AcAl specimens to that of AsM specimen was in the range of 1.5-6. The fatigue lives of AcAl specimens were much more severely affected by the applied surface treatments with fatigue lives up to 23 times smaller than that of AsM specimens particularly for the porous structures with the highest porosity.

We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of \u00b1 1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds.

Higher AD and Ca(2+) ion release was observed at lower pH (5.0) than that at higher pH (7.4). AD and Ca(2+) release, surface morphology, and phase analysis after release indicated a matrix degradation dominated AD release caused by TCP dissolution. PCL coating showed its effectiveness for controlled and sustained AD release. Six different scaffold compositions, namely, (i) TCP (bare TCP), (ii) TCP + AD (AD-coated TCP), (iii) TCP + PCL (PCL-coated TCP), (iv) TCP + PCL + AD, (v) TCP + AD + PCL, and (vi) TCP + AD + PCL + AD were tested in the distal femoral defect of Sprague-Dawley rats for 6 and 10 weeks. An excellent bone formation inside the micro and macro pores of the scaffolds was observed from histomorphology. Histomorphometric analysis revealed maximum new bone formation in TCP + AD + PCL scaffolds after 6 weeks. No adverse effect of PCL on bioactivity of TCP and in vivo bone formation was observed. All scaffolds with AD showed higher bone formation and reduced TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) positive cells activity compared to bare TCP and TCP coated with only PCL. Bare TCP scaffolds showed the highest TRAP positive cells activity followed by TCP + PCL scaffolds, whereas TCP + AD scaffolds showed the lowest TRAP activity. A higher TRAP positive cells activity was observed in TCP + AD + PCL compared to TCP + AD scaffolds after 6 weeks.

However, these methods have no ad hoc control over the actual deposition of cells. Direct patterning methods like bioprinting offer good control over cell position, but require sophisticated instrumentation and are often cost- and time-intensive.

In this longitudinal study, we applied and compared three types of biofunctionalizing surface treatments, namely acid-alkali (AcAl), alkali-acid-heat treatment (AlAcH), and anodizing-heat treatment (AnH). The effects of treatments on apatite forming ability, cell attachment, cell proliferation, osteogenic gene expression, bone regeneration, biomechanical stability, and bone-biomaterial contact were evaluated using apatite forming ability test, cell culture assays, and animal experiments. It was found that AcAl and AnH work through completely different routes. While AcAl improved the apatite forming ability of as-manufactured (AsM) specimens, it did not have any positive effect on cell attachment, cell proliferation, and osteogenic gene expression. In contrast, AnH did not improve the apatite forming ability of AsM specimens but showed significantly better cell attachment, cell proliferation, and expression of osteogenic markers. The performance of AlAcH in terms of apatite forming ability and cell response was in between both extremes of AnH and AsM. AcAl resulted in significantly larger volumes of newly formed bone within the pores of the scaffold as compared to AnH. Interestingly, larger volumes of regenerated bone did not translate into improved biomechanical stability as AnH exhibited significantly better biomechanical stability as compared to AcAl suggesting that the beneficial effects of cell-nanotopography modulations somehow surpassed the benefits of improved apatite forming ability.

As a proof of concept towards the development of anatomically relevant TECs, this concept was utilized for the design and fabrication of a highly porous sheep tibia scaffold around which a bioreactor chamber of similar shape was simultaneously built. The morphology of the bioreactor/scaffold device was investigated by micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy confirming the porous architecture of the sheep tibiae as opposed to the non-porous nature of the bioreactor chamber. Additionally, this study demonstrates that both the shape, as well as the inner architecture of the device can significantly impact the perfusion of fluid within the scaffold architecture. Indeed, fluid flow modelling revealed that this was of significant importance for controlling the nutrition flow pattern within the scaffold and the bioreactor chamber, avoiding the formation of stagnant flow regions detrimental for in vitro tissue development. The bioreactor/scaffold device was dynamically seeded with human primary osteoblasts and cultured under bi-directional perfusion for two and six weeks. Primary human osteoblasts were observed homogenously distributed throughout the scaffold, and were viable for the six week culture period. This work demonstrates a novel application for additive manufacturing in the development of scaffolds and bioreactors. Given the intrinsic flexibility of the additive manufacturing technology platform developed, more complex culture systems can be fabricated which would contribute to the advances in customized and patient-specific tissue engineering strategies for a wide range of applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-05-09", "authors": ["Pedro FCosta", "C\u00e9dryckVaquette", "JeremyBaldwin", "MohitChhaya", "Manuela EGomes", "Rui LReis", "ChristinaTheodoropoulos", "Dietmar WHutmacher"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/3/035006"}

{"title": "Is your system calibrated? MRI gradient system calibration for pre-clinical, high-resolution imaging.", "abstract": "High-field, pre-clinical MRI systems are widely used to characterise tissue structure and volume in small animals, using high resolution imaging. Both applications rely heavily on the consistent, accurate calibration of imaging gradients, yet such calibrations are typically only performed during maintenance sessions by equipment manufacturers, and potentially with acceptance limits that are inadequate for phenotyping. To overcome this difficulty, we present a protocol for gradient calibration quality assurance testing, based on a 3D-printed, open source, structural phantom that can be customised to the dimensions of individual scanners and RF coils. In trials on a 9.4 T system, the gradient scaling errors were reduced by an order of magnitude, and displacements of greater than 100 \u00b5m, caused by gradient non-linearity, were corrected using a post-processing technique. The step-by-step protocol can be integrated into routine pre-clinical MRI quality assurance to measure and correct for these errors. We suggest that this type of quality assurance is essential for robust pre-clinical MRI experiments that rely on accurate imaging gradients, including small animal phenotyping and diffusion MR.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-05-09", "authors": ["JamesO'Callaghan", "JackWells", "SimonRichardson", "HollyHolmes", "YichaoYu", "SimonWalker-Samuel", "BernardSiow", "Mark FLythgoe"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0096568"}

In fact, growth factors are already used in clinical practice and are being investigated for enhancing the capacity for bone tissue regeneration. However, despite their strong osteoinductive activity, these growth factors have several limitations: safety issues, high treatment costs, and the potential for ectopic bone formation. The aim of this study was therefore to develop ceramic scaffolds that could promote the capacity for bone regeneration without growth factors. Three-dimensional ceramic scaffolds were successfully fabricated from hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) using projection-based microstereolithography, which is an additive manufacturing technology. The effects of calcium ions released from ceramic scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The osteogenesis-related gene expression and area of new bone formation in the HA/TCP scaffolds was higher than those in the HA scaffolds. Moreover, regenerated bone tissue in HA/TCP scaffolds were more matured than that in HA scaffolds. Through this study, we were able to enhance the bone regeneration capacity of scaffolds not by growth factors but by calcium ions released from the scaffolds.

We describe the development and face validation of a pediatric pyeloplasty simulator using a low-cost laparoscopic dry-laboratory model developed with 3-dimensional (3D) printing and silicone modeling.\nThe organs (the kidney, renal pelvis, and ureter) were created in a 3-step process where molds were created with 3D modeling software, printed with a Spectrum Z510 3D printer, and cast with Dragon Skin 30 silicone rubber. The model was secured in a laparoscopy box trainer. A pilot study was conducted at a Canadian Urological Association meeting. A total of 24 pediatric urology fellows and 3 experienced faculty members then assessed our skills module during a minimally invasive surgery training course. Participants had 60 minutes to perform a right-side pyeloplasty using laparoscopic tools and 5-0 VICRYL suture.

Current methods to identify redox-cycling activities rely on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and employ enzymatic or chemical methods to detect ROS. Here, we couple the speed and sensitivity of electrochemistry with the molecular-electronic properties of a bio-based redox-capacitor to generate signatures of redox-cycling. The redox capacitor film is electrochemically-fabricated at the electrode surface and is composed of a polysaccharide hydrogel with grafted catechol moieties. This capacitor film is redox-active but non-conducting and can engage diffusible compounds in either oxidative or reductive redox-cycling. Using standard electrochemical mediators ferrocene dimethanol (Fc) and Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (Ru(3+)) as model redox-cyclers, we observed signal amplifications and rectifications that serve as signatures of redox-cycling. Three bio-relevant compounds were then probed for these signatures: (i) ascorbate, a redox-active compound that does not redox-cycle; (ii) pyocyanin, a virulence factor well-known for its reductive redox-cycling; and (iii) acetaminophen, an analgesic that oxidatively redox-cycles but also undergoes conjugation reactions.

In both cases, the electrode is housed in commercially available, polymer-based fittings so that the various electrode materials (platinum, platinum black, carbon, gold, silver) can be easily added to a threaded receiving port printed on the device; this enables a module-like approach to the experimental design, where the electrodes are removable and can be easily repolished for reuse after exposure to biological samples. The first printed device represents a microfluidic platform with a 500 \u00d7 500 \u03bcm channel and a threaded receiving port to allow integration of either polyetheretherketone (PEEK) nut-encased glassy carbon or platinum black (Pt-black) electrodes for dopamine and nitric oxide (NO) detection, respectively. The embedded 1 mm glassy carbon electrode had a limit of detection (LOD) of 500 nM for dopamine and a linear response (R(2) = 0.99) for concentrations between 25-500 \u03bcM. When the glassy carbon electrode was coated with 0.05% Nafion, significant exclusion of nitrite was observed when compared to signal obtained from equimolar injections of dopamine. When using flow injection analysis with a Pt/Pt-black electrode and standards derived from NO gas, a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.99) over a wide range of concentrations (7.6-190 \u03bcM) was obtained, with the LOD for NO being 1 \u03bcM.

{"title": "Oxygen limitation within a bacterial aggregate.", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cells within biofilms exhibit physiological heterogeneity, in part because of chemical gradients existing within these spatially structured communities. Previous work has examined how chemical gradients develop in large biofilms containing >10(8) cells. However, many bacterial communities in nature are composed of small, densely packed aggregates of cells (\u2264 10(5) bacteria). Using a gelatin-based three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy, we confined the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa within picoliter-sized 3D \"microtraps\" that are permeable to nutrients, waste products, and other bioactive small molecules. We show that as a single bacterium grows into a maximally dense (10(12) cells ml(-1)) clonal population, a localized depletion of oxygen develops when it reaches a critical aggregate size of ~55 pl. Collectively, these data demonstrate that chemical and phenotypic heterogeneity exists on the micrometer scale within small aggregate populations. IMPORTANCE Before developing into large, complex communities, microbes initially cluster into aggregates, and it is unclear if chemical heterogeneity exists in these ubiquitous micrometer-scale aggregates. We chose to examine oxygen availability within an aggregate since oxygen concentration impacts a number of important bacterial processes, including metabolism, social behaviors, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. By determining that oxygen availability can vary within aggregates containing \u2264 10(5) bacteria, we establish that physiological heterogeneity exists within P. aeruginosa aggregates, suggesting that such heterogeneity frequently exists in many naturally occurring small populations.", "journal": "mBio", "date": "2014-04-17", "authors": ["Aimee KWessel", "Talha AArshad", "MignonFitzpatrick", "Jodi LConnell", "Roger TBonnecaze", "Jason BShear", "MarvinWhiteley"], "doi": "10.1128/mBio.00992-14\n10.1038/nrmicro1838\n10.1128/JB.185.5.1485-1491.2003\n10.1128/AAC.47.1.317-323.2003\n10.1128/AEM.00710-08\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005513\n10.1038/35037627\n10.1146/annurev.mi.49.100195.003431\n10.1099/00222615-4-3-319\n10.1099/00222615-6-3-323\n10.1073/pnas.0601277103\n10.1016/j.tim.2004.11.004\n10.1073/pnas.0913404107\n10.1016/S0076-6879(95)53033-9\n10.1128/IAI.00586-07\n10.1128/AEM.67.12.5608-5613.2001\n10.1126/science.1126590\n10.1002/anie.200901550\n10.1038/nchembio.264\n10.1126/science.1099390\n10.1126/science.1109173\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0050302\n10.1073/pnas.1309729110\n10.1128/mBio.00202-10\n10.1016/j.ijmm.2010.08.007\n10.1172/JCI200213870\n10.1086/431516\n10.1099/mic.0.26443-0\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07303.x\n10.1128/JB.183.18.5395-5401.2001\n10.1111/j.1574-6976.2012.00328.x\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19980805)59:3<261::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-9\n10.1002/bit.260431118\n10.1021/jp952903y\n10.1128/JB.02273-12\n10.1021/ef050362y\n10.1016/S0168-1656(00)00384-9\n10.1128/AEM.01574-07\n10.1016/j.mimet.2011.01.021\n10.1016/S0076-6879(05)97009-2\n10.4319/lo.1995.40.6.1159\n10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05772.x\n10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02109.x\n10.1073/pnas.91.26.12501\n10.1126/science.280.5361.295\n10.1021/ja068390y\n10.1002/smll.200801084"}

{"title": "Prolonged presence of VEGF promotes vascularization in 3D bioprinted scaffolds with defined architecture.", "abstract": "Timely vascularization is essential for optimal performance of bone regenerative constructs. Vascularization is efficiently stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance with a short half-life time. This study investigates the controlled release of VEGF from gelatin microparticles (GMPs) as a means to prolong VEGF activity at the preferred location within 3D bioprinted scaffolds, and the effects on subsequent vascularization. The release of VEGF from GMPs was continuous for 3 weeks during in vitro studies, and bioactivity was confirmed using human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in migration assays. Traditional and real-time migration assays showed immediate and efficient EPC migration in the presence of GMP-released VEGF, indistinguishable from VEGF-solution that was added to the medium. Matrigel scaffolds containing EPCs and VEGF, which was released either in a fast or sustained fashion by application of GMPs, were investigated for their in vivo vasculogenic capacity. Implantation in subcutaneous pockets in nude mice for one week demonstrated that vessel formation was significantly higher in the VEGF sustained-release group compared to the fast release group. In addition, regional differences with respect to VEGF release were introduced in 3D bioprinted EPC-laden scaffolds and their influence on vasculogenesis was investigated in vivo. The different regions were retained and vessel formation occurred analogous with the results seen in the Matrigel plugs. We conclude that GMPs are suitable to generate sustained release profiles of bioactive VEGF, and that they can be used to create defined differentiation regions in 3D bioprinted heterogeneous constructs, allowing a new generation of smart scaffold design.

This information was used to optimize the design of monetite onlays with different macroporous architecture that were then fabricated using a 3D-printing technique. In\u00a0vivo, bone augmentation was attempted with these customized onlays in rabbits. PET-CT findings demonstrated that bone metabolism in the calvarial bone showed higher activity in the inferior and lateral areas of the onlays.

Our results demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to achieve osseointegration of dental implants in bone augmented with 3D-printed synthetic onlays.

In this study, we investigate a novel method to generate hybrid electrospun scaffolds consisting of both random fibres and a defined three-dimensional (3D) micro-topography at the surface, using patterned resin formers produced by rapid prototyping (RP). Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) was electrospun onto the engineered RP surfaces and the ability of these formers to influence microfibre patterning in the resulting scaffolds visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Electrospun scaffolds with patterns mirroring the microstructures of the formers were successfully fabricated. The effect of the resulting fibre patterns and 3D geometries on mammalian cell adhesion and proliferation was investigated by seeding enhanced green fluorescent protein labelled 3T3 fibroblasts onto the scaffolds. Following 24 h and four days of culture, the seeded scaffolds were visually assessed by confocal macro- and microscopy. The patterning of the fibres guided initial cell adhesion to the scaffold with subsequent proliferation over the geometry resulting in the cells being held in a 3D micro-topography. Such patterning could be designed to replicate a specific in vivo structure; we use the dermal papillae as an exemplar here.

In recent years, additive manufacturing has been intensely investigated for surgical implants, tissue scaffolds, and organs. There is, however, scant literature to date that has investigated the viability of three-dimensional (3D) printing of surgical instruments.\nUsing a fused deposition modeling printer, an Army/Navy surgical retractor was replicated from polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The retractor was sterilized using standard Food and Drug Administration approved glutaraldehyde protocols, tested for bacteria by polymerase chain reaction, and stressed until fracture to determine if the printed instrument could tolerate force beyond the demands of an operating room (OR).\nPrinting required roughly 90 min. The instrument tolerated 13.6 kg of tangential force before failure, both before and after exposure to the sterilant. Freshly extruded PLA from the printer was sterile and produced no polymerase chain reaction product. Each instrument weighed 16 g and required only $0.46 of PLA.\nOur estimates place the cost per unit of a 3D-printed retractor to be roughly 1/10th the cost of a stainless steel instrument. The PLA Army/Navy retractor is strong enough for the demands of the OR. Freshly extruded PLA in a clean environment, such as an OR, would produce a sterile ready-to-use instrument.

Generally, in such cases, an interdisciplinary orthodontic and surgical treatment approach is required. After initial orthodontic alignment of the dental arches, skeletal discrepancies of the jaws can be corrected by distinct surgical strategies and procedures in order to achieve correct occlusal relations, as well as facial balance and harmony within individualized treatment concepts. To transfer the preoperative surgical planning and reposition the mobilized dental arches with optimal occlusal relations, surgical splints are typically used. For this purpose, different strategies have been described which use one or more splints. Traditionally, these splints are manufactured by a dental technician based on patient-specific dental casts; however, computer-assisted technologies have gained increasing importance with respect to preoperative planning and its subsequent surgical transfer.\nIn a pilot study of 10 patients undergoing orthognathic corrections by a one-splint strategy, two final occlusal splints were produced for each patient and compared with respect to their clinical usability. One splint was manufactured in the traditional way by a dental technician according to the preoperative surgical planning. After performing a CBCT scan of the patient's dental casts, a second splint was designed virtually by an engineer and surgeon working together, according to the desired final occlusion. For this purpose, RapidSplint, a custom-made software platform, was used. After post-processing and conversion of the datasets into .stl files, the splints were fabricated by the PolyJet procedure using photo polymerization. During surgery, both splints were inserted after mobilization of the dental arches then compared with respect to their clinical usability according to the occlusal fitting.\nUsing the workflow described above, virtual splints could be designed and manufactured for all patients in this pilot study. Eight of 10 virtual splints could be used clinically to achieve and maintain final occlusion after orthognathic surgery. In two cases virtual splints were not usable due to insufficient occlusal fitting, and even two of the traditional splints were not clinically usable. In five patients where both types of splints were available, their occlusal fitting was assessed as being equivalent, and in one case the virtual splint showed even better occlusal fitting than the traditional splint. In one case where no traditional splint was available, the virtual splint proved to be helpful in achieving the final occlusion.\nIn this pilot study it was demonstrated that clinically usable splints for orthognathic surgery can be produced by computer-assisted technology.

Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure remained stable for extracorporeal flow rates of up to 61\u2009mL/kg/min (101\u2009mL/min). Next, the LAD was connected to umbilical vessels (maximum flow rate of 24\u2009mL/min [10.4\u2009mL/kg/min]), and O2 gas exchange was measured under hypoxic conditions (Fi O2 \u2009=\u20090.15) and was found to be 3.0\u2009\u03bcL/min/cm(2) .

While the use of viruses and virus-like particles is limited by severe constraints, the generation of protein-only nanocarriers is progressively reachable by the engineering of protein-protein interactions, resulting in self-assembling functional building blocks. In particular, end-terminal cationic peptides drive the organization of structurally diverse protein species as regular nanosized oligomers, offering promise in the rational engineering of protein self-assembling. However, the in vivo stability of these constructs, being a critical issue for their medical applicability, needs to be assessed. We have explored here if the cross-molecular contacts between protein monomers, generated by end-terminal cationic peptides and oligohistidine tags, are stable enough for the resulting nanoparticles to overcome biological barriers in assembled form. The analyses of renal clearance and biodistribution of several tagged modular proteins reveal long-term architectonic stability, allowing systemic circulation and tissue targeting in form of nanoparticulate material.

As stresses and strains tend to concentrate around cracks and imperfections, structures tend to fail far before large regions of material have ever been subjected to significant loading. Therefore, a major challenge in material design is to engineer systems that perform on par with pristine structures despite the presence of imperfections. In this work we integrate knowledge of biological systems with computational modeling and state of the art additive manufacturing to synthesize advanced composites with tunable fracture mechanical properties. Supported by extensive mesoscale computer simulations, we demonstrate the design and manufacturing of composites that exhibit deformation mechanisms characteristic of pristine systems, featuring flaw-tolerant properties. We analyze the results by directly comparing strain fields for the synthesized composites, obtained through digital image correlation (DIC), and the computationally tested composites. Moreover, we plot Ashby diagrams for the range of simulated and experimental composites. Our findings show good agreement between simulation and experiment, confirming that the proposed mechanisms have a significant potential for vastly improving the fracture response of composite materials. We elucidate the role of stiffness ratio variations of composite constituents as an important feature in determining the composite properties.

Here we describe a method to fabricate freestanding alginate-based microfibers and microstructures with tunable geometries down to approximately 3 \u00b5m. To do this, a polydimethylsiloxane stamp is used to micromold alginate or alginate-fibrin blends onto a sacrificial layer of thermally-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm). A warm calcium chloride solution is then used to crosslink the alginate and, upon cooling below the lower critical solution temperature (~32 \u00b0C), the PIPAAm layer dissolves and releases the alginate or alginate-fibrin as freestanding microfibers and microstructures. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that C2C12 myoblasts seeded onto the alginate-fibrin microfibers polarize along the fiber length forming interconnected cell strands.

We describe a compact open source tool-the spherical hydrogel generator (Sphyga)-for the fabrication of highly reproducible hydrogel based microbeads with predictable shapes and diameters ranging from 100 to 2000 \u00b5m. The unique feature of the system is the ability to modulate multiple parameters independently, so as to create a wide range of working conditions for fabricating tailored microbeads. Hence, by combining the different fabrication parameters, hydrogel beads with chosen shapes, sizes and materials can be generated with Sphyga. A multiparameter working-window was obtained by fixing the concentration of the base material, alginate, and varying the viscosity of the solution along with Sphyga's fabrication parameters (needle size, external air pressure, and material outflow). To validate the multiparameter working window, components such as proteins, cells, dyes and nanoparticles were also used to fabricate composite microbeads. The results show that the architecture of hydrogel microbeads can be engineered by considering the viscosity of the initial solution, which depends principally on the pH and composition of alginate solution.

{"title": "Generating size-controlled embryoid bodies using laser direct-write.", "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to self-renew and differentiate into any specialized cell type. One common method to differentiate ESCs in vitro is through embryoid bodies (EBs), three-dimensional cellular aggregates that spontaneously self-assemble and generally express markers for the three germ layers, endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. It has been previously shown that both EB size and 2D colony size each influence differentiation. We hypothesized that we could control the size of the EB formed by mouse ESCs (mESCs) by using a cell printing method, laser direct-write (LDW), to control both the size of the initial printed colony and the local cell density in printed colonies. After printing mESCs at various printed colony sizes and printing densities, two-way ANOVAs indicated that the EB diameter was influenced by printing density after three days (p = 0.0002), while there was no effect of the printed colony diameter on the EB diameter at the same timepoint (p = 0.74). There was no significant interaction between these two factors. Tukey's honestly significant difference test showed that high-density colonies formed significantly larger EBs, suggesting that printed mESCs quickly aggregate with nearby cells. Thus, EBs can be engineered to a desired size by controlling printing density, which will influence the design of future differentiation studies.

While collecting the anthropometric data that comprised the panel, additional three-dimensional data were collected on a subset of the subjects.

The in situ crosslinkable hydrogel was composed of hydrazide-modified gelatin (gelatin-ADH) and aldehyde-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-CHO). By simply mixing these two solutions, the gelation occurred in less than 20 s through the formation of a stable hydrazone bond.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells adhering on a gold surface via the oligopeptide layer were transferred to the hydrogel within 5 min, along with electrochemical desorption of the oligopeptides. This approach was applicable to cylindrical needles 200-700 \u00b5m in diameter, resulting in the formation of perfusable microchannels where the internal surface was fully enveloped with the transferred endothelial cells. The entire fabrication process was completed within 10 min, including 20 s for the hydrogel crosslinking and 5 min for the electrochemical cell transfer.

However, limitations in the use of non-biodegradable implants have been reported. To overcome these limitations, this study presents the development of a bioceramic customized cage to treat a large domestic dog assigned for TTA treatment. A cage was designed using a suitable topology optimization methodology in order to maximize its permeability whilst maintaining the structural integrity, and was manufactured using low temperature 3D printing and implanted in a dog. The cage material and structure was adequately characterized prior to implantation and the in vivo response was carefully monitored regarding the biological response and patient limb function. The manufacturing process resulted in a cage composed of brushite, monetite and tricalcium phosphate, and a highly permeable porous morphology. An overall porosity of 59.2% was achieved by the combination of a microporosity of approximately 40% and a designed interconnected macropore network with pore sizes of 845 \u03bcm.

The Parylene C scaffolds are fabricated by selectively increasing the material's surface water affinity through lithography and oxygen plasma treatment, providing free bonds for attachment of hydrophilic biomolecules. The micro-engineered constructs were tested as culture scaffolds for rat ventricular fibroblasts and neonatal myocytes (NRVM), toward modeling the unique anisotropic architecture of native cardiac tissue. The scaffolds induced the patterning of extracellular matrix compounds and therefore of the cells, which demonstrated substantial alignment compared to typical unstructured cultures. Ca(2+)\u00a0cycling properties of the NRVM measured at rates of stimulation 0.5-2\u00a0Hz were significantly modified with a shorter time to peak and time to 90% decay, and a larger fluorescence amplitude (p < 0.001).

{"title": "Indirect three-dimensional printing of synthetic polymer scaffold based on thermal molding process.", "abstract": "One of the major issues in tissue engineering has been the development of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds, which serve as a structural template for cell growth and extracellular matrix formation. In scaffold-based tissue engineering, 3D printing (3DP) technology has been successfully applied for the fabrication of complex 3D scaffolds by using both direct and indirect techniques. In principle, direct 3DP techniques rely on the straightforward utilization of the final scaffold materials during the actual scaffold fabrication process. In contrast, indirect 3DP techniques use a negative mold based on a scaffold design, to which the desired biomaterial is cast and then sacrificed to obtain the final scaffold. Such indirect 3DP techniques generally impose a solvent-based process for scaffold fabrication, resulting in a considerable increase in the fabrication time and poor mechanical properties. In addition, the internal architecture of the resulting scaffold is affected by the properties of the biomaterial solution. In this study, we propose an advanced indirect 3DP technique using projection-based micro-stereolithography and an injection molding system (IMS) in order to address these challenges. The scaffold was fabricated by a thermal molding process using IMS to overcome the limitation of the solvent-based molding process in indirect 3DP techniques. The results indicate that the thermal molding process using an IMS has achieved a substantial reduction in scaffold fabrication time and has also provided the scaffold with higher mechanical modulus and strength. In addition, cell adhesion and proliferation studies have indicated no significant difference in cell activity between the scaffolds prepared by solvent-based and thermal molding processes.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-03-25", "authors": ["Jeong HunPark", "Jin WooJung", "Hyun-WookKang", "Dong-WooCho"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/2/025003"}

In this work, a technique for the coaxial melt extrusion printing of core-shell scaffold structures was designed, implemented and assessed with respect to the repeatability, cell efficacy and scaffold porosity obtainable. Encapsulated alginate hydrogel/thermoplastic polycaprolactone (Alg-PCL) cofibre scaffolds were fabricated. Selective laser melting was used to produce a high resolution stainless steel 316 L coaxial extrusion nozzle, exhibiting diameters of 300 \u03bcm/900 \u03bcm for the inner and outer nozzles respectively.

In this context, the advent of affordable and effective rapid prototyping equipment, such as the Fab@home plotter, has contributed to the development of novel scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In this study, we report for the first time the use of a Fab@home plotter for the production of 3D scaffolds composed by beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP)/alginate hybrid materials. \u03b2-TCP/alginate mixtures were used in a proportion of 50/50% (w/w), 30/70% (w/w) and 20/80% (w/w). The printing parameters were optimized to a nozzle diameter of 20 Gauge for the production of rigid scaffolds with pre-defined architectures. We observed that, despite using similar printing parameters, both the precision and resolution of the scaffolds were significantly affected by the blend's viscosity. In particular, we demonstrate that the higher viscosity of 50/50 scaffolds (150.0 \u00b1 3.91 mPa s) provides a higher precision in the extrusion process. The physicochemical and biological characterization of the samples demonstrated that the 50/50 scaffolds possessed a resistance to compression comparable to that of native trabecular bone. Moreover, this particular formulation also exhibited a Young's modulus that was higher than that of trabecular bone. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that osteoblasts were able to adhere, proliferate and also penetrate into the scaffold's architecture.

For this, PLA/PEG blends with 5, 10 and 20% (w/w) of PEG and PLA/PEG/bioactive CaP glass composites were processed in the form of 3D rapid prototyping scaffolds. Surface analysis and differential scanning calorimetry revealed a rearrangement of polymer chains and a topography, wettability and elastic modulus increase of the studied surfaces as PEG was incorporated. Moreover, addition of 10 and 20% PEG led to non-uniform 3D structures with lower mechanical properties. In vitro degradation studies showed that the inclusion of PEG significantly accelerated the degradation rate of the material.

Application of a water-based binder ensured the manufacture of CaP:CaSO4 constructs on a reliable and repeatable basis, without long term damage of the printhead. Printability of CaP:CaSO4 powders was quantitatively assessed by investigating the key 3DP process parameters, i.e. in-process powder bed packing, drop penetration behavior and the quality of printed solid constructs. Effects of particle size, CaP:CaSO4 ratio and CaP powder type on the 3DP process were considered. The drop penetration technique was used to reliably identify powder formulations that could be potentially used for the application of tissue engineered bone scaffolds using the 3DP technique. Significant improvements (p<0.05) in the 3DP process parameters were found for CaP (30-110 \u03bcm):CaSO4 powders compared to CaP (<20 \u03bcm):CaSO4 powders.

{"title": "Consequences of EEG electrode position error on ultimate beamformer source reconstruction performance.", "abstract": "Inaccuracy of EEG electrode coordinates forms an error term in forward model generation and ultimate source reconstruction performance. This error arises from the combination of both intrinsic measurement noise of the digitization apparatus and manual coregistration error when selecting corresponding points on anatomical MRI volumes. A common assumption is that such an error would lead only to displacement of localized sources. Here, we measured electrode positions on a 3D-printed full-scale replica head, using three different techniques: a fringe projection 3D scanner, a novel \"Flying Triangulation\" 3D sensor, and a traditional electromagnetic digitizer. Using highly accurate fringe projection data as ground truth, the Flying Triangulation sensor had a mean error of 1.5 mm while the electromagnetic digitizer had a mean error of 6.8 mm. Then, again using the fringe projection as ground truth, individual EEG simulations were generated, with source locations across the brain space and a range of sensor noise levels. The simulated datasets were then processed using a beamformer in conjunction with the electrode coordinates registered with the Flying Triangulation and electromagnetic digitizer methods. The beamformer's output SNR was severely degraded with the digitizer-based positions but less severely with the Flying Triangulation coordinates. Therefore, the seemingly innocuous error in electrode registration may result in substantial degradation of beamformer performance, with output SNR penalties up to several decibels. In the case of low-SNR signals such as deeper brain structures or gamma band sources, this implies that sensor coregistration accuracy could make the difference between successful detection of such activity or complete failure to resolve the source.", "journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["Sarang SDalal", "StefanRampp", "FlorianWillomitzer", "SvenjaEttl"], "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2014.00042\n10.1007/s10548-012-0274-6\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.05.008\n10.1121/1.1977982\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.01.023\n10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.03.012).\n10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.02.006\n10.1007/s00429-011-0307-z\n10.1155/2011/758973\n10.1016/0013-4694(91)90023-W\n10.1364/AO.51.000281\n10.1117/12.2020533\n10.1016/j.neuron.2008.04.020\n10.1109/TAES.1986.310775\n10.1186/1475-925X-9-45\n10.1155/2011/923703\n10.1016/j.clinph.2005.07.007\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.07.031\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.036\n10.1002/ana.21847\n10.1002/hbm.20750\n10.1016/S0013-4694(98)00121-7\n10.1007/s10439-010-0230-0\n10.1016/S0013-4694(98)00004-2\n10.1152/jn.00177.2011\n10.1016/S1350-4533(00)00070-9\n10.1109/TBME.2000.880100\n10.1088/0031-9155/57/4/999\n10.1002/hbm.21068\n10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02579.x\n10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346235\n10.1002/hbm.20986\n10.1038/nrn2774\n10.1109/10.623056\n10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00594-6\n10.1002/hbm.20465"}

All particles were 3D-printed in hard resin. Well-defined initial packing states were established through preconditioning by cyclic loading under given confinement pressure. Starting from such initial states, stress-strain relationships for axial compression were obtained at four different confining pressures for each particle type. While confining pressure has the largest overall effect on the mechanical response, we find that particle shape controls the details of the stress-strain curves and can be used to tune packing stiffness and yielding. By correlating the experimentally measured values for the effective Young's modulus under compression, yield stress and energy loss during cyclic loading, we identify trends among the various shapes that allow for designing a packing's aggregate behavior.", "journal": "Soft matter", "date": "2014-03-22", "authors": ["Athanasios GAthanassiadis", "Marc ZMiskin", "PaulKaplan", "NicholasRodenberg", "Seung HwanLee", "JasonMerritt", "EricBrown", "JohnAmend", "HodLipson", "Heinrich MJaeger"], "doi": "10.1039/c3sm52047a"}

Wet-spun collagen fibers were characterized by tensile and thermal behavior, diameter uniformity, the swelling response in phosphate buffered saline and their biocompatibility with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and Schwann cells. Fibers formed from 0.75% weight by volume (w/v) collagen dispersions formed the best fibers in terms of tensile behavior and fiber uniformity. Fibers post-treated with the cross-linkers glutaraldehyde and genipin exhibited increased mechanical stability and reduced swelling. Importantly, genipin-treated fibers were conducive to DRG neurons and Schwann cell survival and growth, which validated the use of this cross-linker for neural tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["Mevan LSiriwardane", "KathleenDeRosa", "GeorgeCollins", "Bryan JPfister"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015012"}
{"title": "Influence of engineered surface on cell directionality and motility.", "abstract": "Control of cell migration is important in numerous key biological processes, and is implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis and inflammatory diseases. Many previous studies indicated that cell migration could be guided by micropatterns fabricated on cell culture surfaces. In this study, we designed a polydimethylsiloxane cell culture substrate with gratings punctuated by corners and ends, and studied its effects on the behavior of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells. MC3T3-E1 cells elongated and aligned with the gratings, and the migration paths of the cells appeared to be guided by the grating pattern. Interestingly, more than 88% of the cells cultured on these patterns were observed to reverse their migration directions at least once during the 16\u00a0h examination period. Most of the reversal events occurred at the corners and the ends of the pattern, suggesting these localized topographical features induce an abrupt loss in directional persistence. Moreover, the cell speed was observed to increase temporarily right after each directional reversal. Focal adhesion complexes were more well-established in cells on the angular gratings than on flat surfaces, but the formation of filipodia appeared to be imbalanced at the corners and the ends, possibly leading to the loss of directional persistence. This study describes the first engineered cell culture surface that consistently induces changes in the directional persistence of adherent cells. This will provide an experimental model for the study of this phenomenon and a valuable platform to control the cell motility and directionality, which can be used for cell screening and selection.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["Qing YuanTang", "Wing YinTong", "JueShi", "PengShi", "Yun WahLam", "Stella WPang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015011"}

Although numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have investigated tissue engineering alternatives to autografting, the achievement of a functional histological transition between soft and hard tissue has remained elusive. To bridge this gap we developed and tested a novel multiphase scaffold of silk, tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and polyether ether ketone for ACL reconstruction. We present in vitro biomechanical tests demonstrating that the construct recapitulates native ACL function under typical physiological loads. A pilot in vivo experiment in two pigs with a three-month follow-up showed a robust histological transition between regenerated fibrous tissue and the margins of the bone tunnel, with histological features similar to the native ACL to bone insertion. These histological observations suggest that the construct was stably anchored until TCP incorporation to the host tissues. On the strength of these preliminary results, we conclude that the described approach may offer a promising alternative to autograft for ACL reconstruction. This study thus provides proof for a concept that warrants further development.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["XiangLi", "JiankangHe", "WeiguoBian", "ZhengLi", "DichenLi", "Jess GSnedeker"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015010"}

However, current methods for MCS generation and analysis still suffer drawbacks such as being labor-intensive and of poor controllability, and are not suitable for high-throughput applications. This study demonstrates a novel microfluidic chip to facilitate MCS formation, culturing and analysis. The chip contains an array of U-shaped microstructures fabricated by photopolymerizing the poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogel through defining the ultraviolet light exposure pattern with a photomask. The geometry of the U-shaped microstructures allowed trapping cells into the pocket through the actions of fluid flow and the force of gravity. The hydrogel is non-adherent for cells, promoting the formation of MCS. Its permselective property also facilitates exchange of nutrients and waste for MCS, while providing protection of MCS from shearing stress during the medium perfusion. Heterotypic MCS can be formed easily by manipulating the cell trapping steps. Subsequent drug susceptibility analysis and long-term culture could also be achieved within the same chip. This MCS formation and culture platform can be used as a micro-scale bioreactor and applied in many cell biology and drug testing studies.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-03-05", "authors": ["Chien-YuFu", "Sheng-YangTseng", "Shih-MoYang", "LongHsu", "Cheng-HsienLiu", "Hwan-YouChang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015009"}

Metabolites from plant extracts represent a better alternative to chemical methods to fulfill the growing demand for non-hazardous nanoparticle synthesis routes. Selenium and its nanoparticles have an extensive range of applications. Thus, biofabrication of selenium nanoparticles can be potentially useful in various fields. This study reports a green approach to biosynthesize selenium nanoparticles (Se-np) using dried Vitis vinifera (raisin) extracts. The biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Transmission electron microscopic images revealed the spherical shape of biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles and a size range of 3-18 nm. Dynamic light scattering also confirmed the average particle size of 8.12 \u00b1 2.5 nm with 0.212 PDI. The crystalline nature of selenium nanoparticles was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction study.

{"title": "Mechanical behavior of regular open-cell porous biomaterials made of diamond lattice unit cells.", "abstract": "Cellular structures with highly controlled micro-architectures are promising materials for orthopedic applications that require bone-substituting biomaterials or implants. The availability of additive manufacturing techniques has enabled manufacturing of biomaterials made of one or multiple types of unit cells. The diamond lattice unit cell is one of the relatively new types of unit cells that are used in manufacturing of regular porous biomaterials. As opposed to many other types of unit cells, there is currently no analytical solution that could be used for prediction of the mechanical properties of cellular structures made of the diamond lattice unit cells. In this paper, we present new analytical solutions and closed-form relationships for predicting the elastic modulus, Poisson\u05f3s ratio, critical buckling load, and yield (plateau) stress of cellular structures made of the diamond lattice unit cell. The mechanical properties predicted using the analytical solutions are compared with those obtained using finite element models. A number of solid and porous titanium (Ti6Al4V) specimens were manufactured using selective laser melting. A series of experiments were then performed to determine the mechanical properties of the matrix material and cellular structures. The experimentally measured mechanical properties were compared with those obtained using analytical solutions and finite element (FE) models. It has been shown that, for small apparent density values, the mechanical properties obtained using analytical and numerical solutions are in agreement with each other and with experimental observations. The properties estimated using an analytical solution based on the Euler-Bernoulli theory markedly deviated from experimental results for large apparent density values. The mechanical properties estimated using FE models and another analytical solution based on the Timoshenko beam theory better matched the experimental observations.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2014-02-26", "authors": ["S MAhmadi", "GCampoli", "SAmin Yavari", "BSajadi", "RWauthle", "JSchrooten", "HWeinans", "A AZadpoor"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.02.003"}
{"title": "The marine sponge-derived inorganic polymers, biosilica and polyphosphate, as morphogenetically active matrices/scaffolds for the differentiation of human multipotent stromal cells: potential application in 3D printing and distraction osteogenesis.", "abstract": "The two marine inorganic polymers, biosilica (BS), enzymatically synthesized from ortho-silicate, and polyphosphate (polyP), a likewise enzymatically synthesized polymer consisting of 10 to >100 phosphate residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, have previously been shown to display a morphogenetic effect on osteoblasts. In the present study, the effect of these polymers on the differential differentiation of human multipotent stromal cells (hMSC), mesenchymal stem cells, that had been encapsulated into beads of the biocompatible plant polymer alginate, was studied. The differentiation of the hMSCs in the alginate beads was directed either to the osteogenic cell lineage by exposure to an osteogenic medium (mineralization activation cocktail; differentiation into osteoblasts) or to the chondrogenic cell lineage by incubating in chondrocyte differentiation medium (triggering chondrocyte maturation). Both biosilica and polyP, applied as Ca\u00b2\u207a salts, were found to induce an increased mineralization in osteogenic cells; these inorganic polymers display also morphogenetic potential. The effects were substantiated by gene expression studies, which revealed that biosilica and polyP strongly and significantly increase the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in osteogenic cells, which was significantly more pronounced in osteogenic versus chondrogenic cells. A differential effect of the two polymers was seen on the expression of the two collagen types, I and II. While collagen Type I is highly expressed in osteogenic cells, but not in chondrogenic cells after exposure to biosilica or polyP, the upregulation of the steady-state level of collagen Type II transcripts in chondrogenic cells is comparably stronger than in osteogenic cells. It is concluded that the two polymers, biosilica and polyP, are morphogenetically active additives for the otherwise biologically inert alginate polymer. It is proposed that alginate, supplemented with polyP and/or biosilica, is a suitable biomaterial that promotes the growth and differentiation of hMSCs and might be beneficial for application in 3D tissue printing of hMSCs and for the delivery of hMSCs in fractures, surgically created during distraction osteogenesis.", "journal": "Marine drugs", "date": "2014-02-26", "authors": ["XiaohongWang", "Heinz CSchr\u00f6der", "VladislavGrebenjuk", "B\u00e4rbelDiehl-Seifert", "VolkerMail\u00e4nder", "RenateSteffen", "UteSchlo\u00dfmacher", "Werner E GM\u00fcller"], "doi": "10.3390/md12021131\n10.1097/00007890-196803000-00009\n10.1126/science.284.5411.143\n10.1093/bmb/ldr035\n10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.02.004\n10.1203/PDR.0b013e31816a743e\n10.1002/term.1745\n10.1016/S0889-5406(99)70266-0\n10.1097/00005131-199802000-00008\n10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.8.1221\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.02.017\n10.1039/c3bm00001j\n10.1016/j.copbio.2012.01.018\n10.1002/chem.201204412\n10.1038/239333a0\n10.1007/s00223-010-9408-6\n10.1039/c2bm00108j\n10.1161/01.RES.0000135902.99383.6f\n10.1002/jor.1100090504\n10.1007/978-1-60761-999-4_20\n10.1073/pnas.74.9.3864\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08040.x\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.03.007\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00950-X\n10.1039/c3ra23341c\n10.1007/s13233-010-0804-6\n10.1080/08977190600621362\n10.1159/000075032\n10.1002/jcp.1041440115\n10.1097/BCO.0b013e3282630851\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.12.022\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19960520)50:4<374::AID-BIT4>3.0.CO;2-I\n10.1002/jbm.b.30322"}

We used CAD to design perfectly ordered beds with octahedral beads (115 \u03bcm apothem) packed in a simple cubic configuration and monoliths with hexagonal channels (150 \u03bcm apothem) in parallel and herringbone arrangements. The models were then printed by UV curing of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene powder layers. Each porous bed was printed at 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mL volumes, within a complete column, including internal flow distributors and threaded 10-32 flow connectors. Close replication of CAD models was achieved. The resultant individual octahedral beads were highly uniform in size, with apothems of 113.6\u00b11.9 \u03bcm, while the monolith hexagonal cross-section channels had apothems of 148.2\u00b12.0 \u03bcm. Residence time distribution measurements show that the beds largely behaved as expected from their design void volumes. Radial and fractal flow distributor designs were also tested. The former displayed poor flow distribution in parallel and herringbone pore columns, while the fractal distributors provided uniform flow distribution over the entire cross section. The results show that 3D printing is a feasible method for producing precisely controlled porous media.

Rheological analysis and differential scanning calorimetry of the starting material showed that compression moulded PU films were in the molten state at a higher temperature than 155\u00b0C. The AM processing temperature was set at 155\u00b0C after verifying the absence of PU thermal degradation phenomena by isothermal thermogravimetry analysis and rheological characterization performed at 165\u00b0C.

So far, tissue printing has neither been used for 3D patterning of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in multiphase growth factor embedded 3D hydrogels nor been investigated phenotypically in terms of simultaneous differentiation into different cell types within the same micropatterned 3D tissue constructs. Accordingly, we demonstrated a biochemical gradient by bioprinting nanoliter droplets encapsulating human MSCs, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), and transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF- \u03b21), engineering an anisotropic biomimetic fibrocartilage microenvironment. Assessment of the model tissue construct displayed multiphasic anisotropy of the incorporated biochemical factors after patterning. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results suggested genomic expression patterns leading to simultaneous differentiation of MSC populations into osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotype within the multiphasic construct, evidenced by upregulation of osteogenesis and condrogenesis related genes during in vitro culture.

On the conducting line, the polymer nanojet is spontaneously stacked successively to form a wall-like structure. We rationalize the length of the wall by balancing the tension in the polymer fiber with the electrostatic interaction of the fiber with the metal ground. We also show that the length of a nanowall can be controlled by translating the substrate.

However, the ear is known to be difficult to regenerate using traditional methods due to its complex shape and composition. In this study, we used three-dimensional (3D) printing technology including a sacrificial layer process to regenerate both the auricular cartilage and fat tissue. The main part was printed with poly-caprolactone (PCL) and cell-laden hydrogel. At the same time, poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG) was also deposited as a sacrificial layer to support the main structure. After complete fabrication, PEG can be easily removed in aqueous solutions, and the procedure for removing PEG has no effect on the cell viability. For fabricating composite tissue, chondrocytes and adipocytes differentiated from adipose-derived stromal cells were encapsulated in hydrogel to dispense into the cartilage and fat regions, respectively, of ear-shaped structures. Finally, we fabricated the composite structure for feasibility testing, satisfying expectations for both the geometry and anatomy of the native ear.

Herein, we demonstrate that the fabrication of micro-channels in alginate scaffold combined with the presentation of adhesion peptides and an angiogenic growth factor promote vessel-like networks in the construct, both in vitro and in vivo. Using a CO2 laser engraving system, 200 \u00b5m diameter channels were formed from top to bottom of the 2 mm thick alginate scaffold, with a channel-to-channel distance of 400 \u00b5m. Cells were seeded in a sequential manner onto the scaffolds: first, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded and cultured for three days, then neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiofibroblasts were added at a final cell ratio of 50:35:15, respectively, and the constructs were cultivated for an additional seven days. A vessel-like network was formed within the cell constructs, wherein HUVECs were organized around the channels in a multilayer manner, while the CMs were located in-between the channels and exhibited the characteristic morphological features of a mature cardiac fiber. Acellular scaffolds with the affinity-bound basic fibroblast growth factor were implanted subcutaneously in mice. Increased cell penetration into the channeled scaffold and greater vessel density were found in comparison with the nonchanneled scaffolds.

This work demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of these two different rapid prototyping methods for production of bone scaffolds. Compared to 3DP, SLA provides for smaller feature production with better dimensional resolution and accuracy. The permeability of these structures was evaluated experimentally and via numerical simulation utilizing a newly derived Kozeny-Carman based equation for intrinsic permeability. Both experimental and simulation studies took account of porosity percentage, pore size, and pore geometry. Porosity content was varied from 30% to 70%, pore size from 0.34 mm to 3 mm, and pore geometries of cubic and hexagonal closed packed were examined. Two different fluid viscosity levels of 1 mPa \u00b7 s and 3.6 mPa \u00b7 s were used. The experimental and theoretical results indicated that permeability increased when larger pore size, increased fluid viscosity, and higher percentage porosity were utilized, with highest to lowest degree of significance following the same order. Higher viscosity was found to result in permeabilities 2.2 to 3.3 times higher than for water. This latter result was found to be independent of pore morphology type. As well as demonstrating method for determining design parameters most beneficial for scaffold structure design, the results also illustrate how the variations in patient's blood viscosity can be extremely important in allowing for permeability through the bone and scaffold structures.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In this novel technology, live multicellular aggregates are used as fundamental building blocks to make tissues or organs (collectively known as the bio-constructs,) via the layer-by-layer deposition technique or other methods; the printed bio-constructs embedded in maturogens, consisting of nutrient-rich bio-compatible hydrogels, are then placed in bioreactors to undergo the cellular aggregate fusion process to form the desired functional bio-structures. Our approach reported here is an agent-based modeling method, which uses the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm to evolve the cellular system on a lattice. In this method, the cells and the hydrogel media, in which cells are embedded, are coarse-grained to material's points on a three-dimensional (3D) lattice, where the cell-cell and cell-medium interactions are quantified by adhesion and cohesion energies. In a multicellular aggregate system with a fixed number of cells and fixed amount of hydrogel media, where the effect of cell differentiation, proliferation and death are tactically neglected, the interaction energy is primarily dictated by the interfacial energy between cell and cell as well as between cell and medium particles on the lattice, respectively, based on the differential adhesion hypothesis. By using the transition state theory to track the time evolution of the multicellular system while minimizing the interfacial energy, KMC is shown to be an efficient time-dependent simulation tool to study the evolution of the multicellular aggregate system. In this study, numerical experiments are presented to simulate fusion and cell sorting during the biofabrication process of vascular networks, in which the bio-constructs are fabricated via engineering designs. The results predict the feasibility of fabricating the vascular structures via the bioprinting technology and demonstrate the morphological development process during cellular aggregate fusion in various engineering designed structures.

{"title": "Validating continuous digital light processing (cDLP) additive manufacturing accuracy and tissue engineering utility of a dye-initiator package.", "abstract": "This study tested the accuracy of tissue engineering scaffold rendering via the continuous digital light processing (cDLP) light-based additive manufacturing technology. High accuracy (i.e., <50\u00a0\u00b5m) allows the designed performance of features relevant to three scale spaces: cell-scaffold, scaffold-tissue, and tissue-organ interactions. The biodegradable polymer poly (propylene fumarate) was used to render highly accurate scaffolds through the use of a dye-initiator package, TiO2\u00a0and bis (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenylphosphine oxide. This dye-initiator package facilitates high accuracy in the Z dimension. Linear, round, and right-angle features were measured to gauge accuracy. Most features showed accuracies between 5.4-15% of the design. However, one feature, an 800\u00a0\u00b5m diameter circular pore, exhibited a 35.7% average reduction of patency. Light scattered in the x, y directions by the dye may have reduced this feature's accuracy. Our new fine-grained understanding of accuracy could be used to make further improvements by including corrections in the scaffold design software. Successful cell attachment occurred with both canine and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Highly accurate cDLP scaffold rendering is critical to the design of scaffolds that both guide bone regeneration and that fully resorb. Scaffold resorption must occur for regenerated bone to be remodeled and, thereby, achieve optimal strength.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2014-01-17", "authors": ["JonathanWallace", "Martha OWang", "PaulThompson", "MalloryBusso", "VaijayanteeBelle", "NicoleMammoser", "KyobumKim", "John PFisher", "AliSiblani", "YueshuoXu", "Jean FWelter", "Donald PLennon", "JiayangSun", "Arnold ICaplan", "DavidDean"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015003"}

The creation of a high-fidelity model allows surgical trainees to practice in a standardized and reproducible training environment. This learning paradigm will significantly augment resident understanding of surgical approaches and techniques to prevent adverse outcomes.\nWe describe a technique for generating internally accurate rapid-prototyped anatomical models with solid and hollow structures, including void spaces. The novel slicing algorithm digitally deconstructs a model into segments and permits removal of extraneous print material and allows infiltrant penetration of the entire bone structure. Precise reassembly is facilitated by digitally generated fiducials.

Void space representation was excellent with 88% concordance between cadaveric bone and the resultant rapid-prototyped temporal bone model. Ultimately, cyanoacrylate with hydroquinone was determined to be the most appropriate infiltrant for both cortical and trabecular simulation.

Recent studies have shown that AM can be an economically viable option for use by the industry, yet there are some inherent challenges associated with AM for wider acceptance. The lack of standards in AM impedes its use for parts production since industries primarily depend on established standards in processes and material selection to ensure the consistency and quality. Inability to compare AM performance against traditional manufacturing methods can be a barrier for implementing AM processes. AM process sustainability has become a driver due to growing environmental concerns for manufacturing. This has reinforced the importance to understand and characterize AM processes for sustainability. Process characterization for sustainability will help close the gaps for comparing AM performance to traditional manufacturing methods.

The recommended stress-relief heat treatment increases the tensile strength, reduces the yield strength, and decreases the extent of the discontinuous yielding. The mechanical properties, assessed by hardness, are very uniform across the build plate, but the stress-relief heat treatment introduced a small non-uniformity that had no correlation to position on the build plate.

{"title": "Mixed reality temporal bone surgical dissector: mechanical design.", "abstract": "The Development of a Novel Mixed Reality (MR) Simulation. An evolving training environment emphasizes the importance of simulation. Current haptic temporal bone simulators have difficulty representing realistic contact forces and while 3D printed models convincingly represent vibrational properties of bone, they cannot reproduce soft tissue. This paper introduces a mixed reality model, where the effective elements of both simulations are combined; haptic rendering of soft tissue directly interacts with a printed bone model. This paper addresses one aspect in a series of challenges, specifically the mechanical merger of a haptic device with an otic drill. This further necessitates gravity cancelation of the work assembly gripper mechanism. In this system, the haptic end-effector is replaced by a high-speed drill and the virtual contact forces need to be repositioned to the drill tip from the mid wand. Previous publications detail generation of both the requisite printed and haptic simulations.\nCustom software was developed to reposition the haptic interaction point to the drill tip. A custom fitting, to hold the otic drill, was developed and its weight was offset using the haptic device. The robustness of the system to disturbances and its stable performance during drilling were tested. The experiments were performed on a mixed reality model consisting of two drillable rapid-prototyped layers separated by a free-space. Within the free-space, a linear virtual force model is applied to simulate drill contact with soft tissue.\nTesting illustrated the effectiveness of gravity cancellation. Additionally, the system exhibited excellent performance given random inputs and during the drill's passage between real and virtual components of the model.

The gelatin shell increased hydrophilicity and glucose transport flux across the coaxial fibre membranes. The coaxial fibre membranes having small fibre diameter (541\u00a0nm) and a thick gelatin shell (52%) did not affect the sensor sensitivity, but decreased sensor's linearity in the long run. In contrast, thicker coaxial fibre membranes (1133\u00a0nm) having a thin gelatin shell (34%) maintained both sensitivity and linearity for the 84\u00a0days of the study period. To conclude, polyurethane-gelatin coaxial fibre membranes, due to their faster permeability to glucose, tailorable mechanical properties and bioactivity, are potential candidates for coatings to favourably modify the host responses to extend the reliable in vivo lifetime of implantable glucose biosensors.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["NingWang", "KrishnaBurugapalli", "ShaviniWijesuriya", "Mahshid YazdiFar", "WenhuiSong", "FrancisMoussy", "YudongZheng", "YanxuanMa", "ZhentaoWu", "KangLi"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015002"}
{"title": "Adult rat retinal ganglion cells and glia can be printed by piezoelectric inkjet printing.", "abstract": "We have investigated whether inkjet printing technology can be extended to print cells of the adult rat central nervous system (CNS), retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and glia, and the effects on survival and growth of these cells in culture, which is an important step in the development of tissue grafts for regenerative medicine, and may aid in the cure of blindness. We observed that RGC and glia can be successfully printed using a piezoelectric printer. Whilst inkjet printing reduced the cell population due to sedimentation within the printing system, imaging of the printhead nozzle, which is the area where the cells experience the greatest shear stress and rate, confirmed that there was no evidence of destruction or even significant distortion of the cells during jet ejection and drop formation. Importantly, the viability of the cells was not affected by the printing process. When we cultured the same number of printed and non-printed RGC/glial cells, there was no significant difference in cell survival and RGC neurite outgrowth. In addition, use of a glial substrate significantly increased RGC neurite outgrowth, and this effect was retained when the cells had been printed. In conclusion, printing of RGC and glia using a piezoelectric printhead does not adversely affect viability and survival/growth of the cells in culture. Importantly, printed glial cells retain their growth-promoting properties when used as a substrate, opening new avenues for printed CNS grafts in regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["BarbaraLorber", "Wen-KaiHsiao", "Ian MHutchings", "Keith RMartin"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/6/1/015001"}
{"title": "Interdroplet bilayer arrays in millifluidic droplet traps from 3D-printed moulds.", "abstract": "In droplet microfluidics, aqueous droplets are typically separated by an oil phase to ensure containment of molecules in individual droplets of nano-to-picoliter volume. An interesting variation of this method involves bringing two phospholipid-coated droplets into contact to form a lipid bilayer in-between the droplets. These interdroplet bilayers, created by manual pipetting of microliter droplets, have proved advantageous for the study of membrane transport phenomena, including ion channel electrophysiology. In this study, we adapted the droplet microfluidics methodology to achieve automated formation of interdroplet lipid bilayer arrays. We developed a 'millifluidic' chip for microliter droplet generation and droplet packing, which is cast from a 3D-printed mould. Droplets of 0.7-6.0 \u03bcL volume were packed as homogeneous or heterogeneous linear arrays of 2-9 droplets that were stable for at least six hours. The interdroplet bilayers had an area of up to 0.56 mm(2), or an equivalent diameter of up to 850 \u03bcm, as determined from capacitance measurements. We observed osmotic water transfer over the bilayers as well as sequential bilayer lysis by the pore-forming toxin melittin. These millifluidic interdroplet bilayer arrays combine the ease of electrical and optical access of manually pipetted microdroplets with the automation and reproducibility of microfluidic technologies. Moreover, the 3D-printing based fabrication strategy enables the rapid implementation of alternative channel geometries, e.g. branched arrays, with a design-to-device time of just 24-48 hours.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2013-12-18", "authors": ["Philip HKing", "GarethJones", "HywelMorgan", "Maurits R Rde Planque", "Klaus-PeterZauner"], "doi": "10.1039/c3lc51072g"}
{"title": "Three-dimensional printed trileaflet valve conduits using biological hydrogels and human valve interstitial cells.", "abstract": "Tissue engineering has great potential to provide a functional de novo living valve replacement, capable of integration with host tissue and growth. Among various valve conduit fabrication techniques, three-dimensional (3-D) bioprinting enables deposition of cells and hydrogels into 3-D constructs with anatomical geometry and heterogeneous mechanical properties. Successful translation of this approach, however, is constrained by the dearth of printable and biocompatible hydrogel materials. Furthermore, it is not known how human valve cells respond to these printed environments. In this study, 3-D printable formulations of hybrid hydrogels are developed, based on methacrylated hyaluronic acid (Me-HA) and methacrylated gelatin (Me-Gel), and used to bioprint heart valve conduits containing encapsulated human aortic valvular interstitial cells (HAVIC). Increasing Me-Gel concentration resulted in lower stiffness and higher viscosity, facilitated cell spreading, and better maintained HAVIC fibroblastic phenotype. Bioprinting accuracy was dependent upon the relative concentrations of Me-Gel and Me-HA, but when optimized enabled the fabrication of a trileaflet valve shape accurate to the original design. HAVIC encapsulated within bioprinted heart valves maintained high viability, and remodeled the initial matrix by depositing collagen and glyosaminoglycans. These findings represent the first rational design of bioprinted trileaflet valve hydrogels that regulate encapsulated human VIC behavior. The use of anatomically accurate living valve scaffolds through bioprinting may accelerate understanding of physiological valve cell interactions and progress towards de novo living valve replacements.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-12-18", "authors": ["BDuan", "EKapetanovic", "L AHockaday", "J TButcher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.12.005\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2013.0258"}

Spinal reconstruction and stabilisation, and bone defect repair play a crucial role in the surgical treatment of spinal TB. Unfortunately, the existing materials have not completely met the requirements for spinal TB reconstruction due to their diverse deficiencies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel reconstructing implants. Poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) are two promising drug delivery systems (DDS) and materials for bone repair, which could help us to overcome the difficulties in spinal TB reconstruction in the future. In this article, we discuss the properties of PDLLA and nHA, two potential drug delivering and bone repair materials for spinal TB reconstruction. We also presented two alternatives for spinal TB in future. Two strategies have the potential for treating spinal TB in the future. One such strategy consists of mixing anti-TB drugs, PDLLA with nHA to fabricate a novel three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffold via 3D printing (3DP) technology. Another is preparing a novel titanium mesh implant coated with drugs/PDLLA/nHA composites by solvent evaporation and low-temperature drying technology.

This work presents dropwise additive manufacturing of pharmaceutical products (DAMPP), an automated, controlled mini-manufacturing method that deposits active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly onto edible substrates using drop-on-demand (DoD) inkjet printing technology. The use of DoD technology allows for precise control over the material properties, drug solid state form, drop size, and drop dynamics and can be beneficial in the creation of high-potency drug forms, combination drugs with multiple APIs or individualized medicine products tailored to a specific patient. In this work, DAMPP was used to create dosage forms from solvent-based formulations consisting of API, polymer, and solvent carrier. The forms were then analyzed to determine the reproducibility of creating an on-target dosage form, the morphology of the API of the final form and the dissolution behavior of the drug over time.

The bone compartment was coated with a calcium phosphate (CaP) layer for increasing osteoconductivity, seeded with osteoblasts and cultured in vitro for 6 weeks. The resulting constructs were then complemented with the placement of PDL cell sheets on the periodontal compartment, attached to a dentin block and subcutaneously implanted into athymic rats for 8 weeks.

{"title": "Finite element analysis of customized reconstruction plates for mandibular continuity defect therapy.", "abstract": "Large mandibular continuity defects pose a significant challenge in oral maxillofacial surgery. One solution to this problem is to use computer-guided surgical planning and additive manufacturing technology to produce patient-specific reconstruction plates. However, when designing customized plates, it is important to assess potential biomechanical responses that may vary substantially depending on the size and geometry of the defect. The aim of this study was to assess the design of two customized plates using finite element method (FEM). These plates were designed for the reconstruction of the lower left mandibles of two ameloblastoma cases (patient 1/plate 1 and patient 2/plate 2) with large bone resections differing in both geometry and size. Simulations revealed maximum von Mises stresses of 63 MPa and 108 MPa in plates 1 and 2, and 65 MPa and 190 MPa in the fixation screws of patients 1 and 2. The equivalent strain induced in the bone at the screw-bone interface reached maximum values of 2739 micro-strain for patient 1 and 19,575 micro-strain for patient 2. The results demonstrate the influence of design on the stresses induced in the plate and screw bodies. Of particular note, however, are the differences in the induced strains. Unphysiologically high strains in bone adjacent to screws can cause micro-damage leading to bone resorption. This can adversely affect the anchoring capabilities of the screws. Thus, while custom plates offer optimal anatomical fit, attention should be paid to the expected physiological forces on the plates and the induced stresses and strains in the plate-screw-bone assembly.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2013-12-03", "authors": ["NathanielNarra", "Ji\u0159\u00edVal\u00e1\u0161ek", "MarkusHannula", "PetrMarci\u00e1n", "George KS\u00e1ndor", "JariHyttinen", "JanWolff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.11.016"}
{"title": "Flow-perfusion interferes with chondrogenic and hypertrophic matrix production by mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Flow-perfusion is being promoted as a way to grow tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro. Yet, there is a concern that flow-perfusion may induce unwanted mechanical effects on chondrogenesis and terminal differentiation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of fluid flow on chondrogenesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy of MSCs in a well-established pellet culture model. Human MSC pellets were mounted into 3D-printed porous scaffolds in basic chondrogenic differentiation medium, containing TGF-\u03b22. Constructs were then allowed to form cartilaginous matrix for 18 days, before they were transferred to a custom-built flow-perfusion system. A continuous flow of 1.22ml min(-1) was applied to the constructs for 10 days. Controls were maintained under static culture conditions. To evaluate chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation, RNA was isolated at day 20 and 28 and histology, immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were performed after 28 days of culture. Abundant matrix was formed in the constructs, but production of chondrogenic and hypertrophic matrix components was affected by flow-perfusion. Although gene expression levels of the (late) hypertrophic and osteogenic marker osteocalcin increased by flow-perfusion, this did not result in more collagen type X protein deposition. Decreased GAG release, in combination with diminished collagen II staining, indicates reduced chondrogenesis in response to flow-perfusion. Caution should thus be taken when applying flow-perfusion to cultures to improve nutrient diffusion. Although we show that it is possible to influence the differentiation of chondrogenic differentiated MSCs by flow-perfusion, effects are inconsistent and strongly donor-dependent.", "journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "date": "2013-12-03", "authors": ["Linda MKock", "JosMalda", "Wouter J ADhert", "KeitaIto", "DebbyGawlitta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2013.11.006"}

In rapid prototyping artificial bone scaffolds process, the binder spraying volume and mechanism are very important for bone scaffolds mechanical properties. In this study, we applied MD simulations to investigating the binding energy of \u03b1-n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) on Hydroxyapatite (HA) crystallographic planes (001, 100 and 110), and to calculating and analyzing the mechanical properties and radial distribution function of the HA(110)/NBCA mixed system. The simulation results suggested that HA (110) has the highest binding energy with NBCA owing to the high planar atom density, and the mechanical properties of HA(110)/NBCA mixed system is stronger than pure HA system. Therefore, the multi-grade strength bone scaffold could be fabricated through spraying various volume NBCA binders during 3D printing process. By calculating the radial distribution function of HA(110)/NBCA, the essence of the interface interaction were successfully elucidated. The forming situation parameters can be referred to calculation results. There exists a strong interaction between HA crystallographic plane (110) and NBCA, it is mainly derived from the hydrogen bonds between O atoms which connect with C atoms of NBCA and H atoms in HA crystal. Furthermore, a strong adsorption effect can be demonstrated between HA and NBCA.", "journal": "Bio-medical materials and engineering", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["YanenWang", "QinghuaWei", "FeilongPan", "MingmingYang", "ShengminWei"], "doi": "10.3233/BME-130874"}

The methodology was based on the use of computed tomography (CT) images for virtual modeling, additive manufacturing for the initial physical replica, and a vacuum casting process and range of polyurethane resins for the final rubberlike phantom. The average wall thickness of the resulting AAA phantom was compared with the average thickness of the corresponding patient-specific virtual model, obtaining an average dimensional mismatch of 180\u2009\u03bcm (11.14%). The material characterization of the artery was determined from uniaxial tensile tests as various combinations of polyurethane resins were chosen due to their similarity with ex vivo AAA mechanical behavior in the physiological stress configuration.

Here, we demonstrate the potential of 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering using human skin as a prototypical example. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used as constituent cells to represent the epidermis and dermis, and collagen was used to represent the dermal matrix of the skin. Preliminary studies were conducted to optimize printing parameters for maximum cell viability as well as for the optimization of cell densities in the epidermis and dermis to mimic physiologically relevant attributes of human skin. Printed 3D constructs were cultured in submerged media conditions followed by exposure of the epidermal layer to the air-liquid interface to promote maturation and stratification. Histology and immunofluorescence characterization demonstrated that 3D printed skin tissue was morphologically and biologically representative of in vivo human skin tissue. In comparison with traditional methods for skin engineering, 3D bioprinting offers several advantages in terms of shape- and form retention, flexibility, reproducibility, and high culture throughput. It has a broad range of applications in transdermal and topical formulation discovery, dermal toxicity studies, and in designing autologous grafts for wound healing.

Very few materials are available that fulfill requirements for bioprinting as well as provide adequate properties for cell encapsulation during and after the printing process. A hydrogel composite including alginate and gelatin precursors was tuned with different concentrations of hydroxyapatite (HA) and characterized in terms of rheology, swelling behavior and mechanical properties to assess the versatility of the system.

Ideally, this skill should be practiced outside the operating room. There is a need for anatomically accurate and cheap models for simulated training. The objective was to develop a cost-effective, anatomically accurate, nonbiologic training model for simulated PCNL access under fluoroscopic guidance.\nCollecting systems from routine computed tomography urograms were extracted and reformatted using specialized software. These images were printed in a water-soluble plastic on a three-dimensional (3D) printer to create biomodels. These models were embedded in silicone and then the models were dissolved in water to leave a hollow collecting system within a silicone model. These PCNL models were filled with contrast medium and sealed. A layer of dense foam acted as a spacer to replicate the tissues between skin and kidney.\n3D printed models of human collecting systems are a useful adjunct in planning PCNL access. The PCNL access training model is relatively low cost and reproduces the anatomy of the renal collecting system faithfully. A range of models reflecting the variety and complexity of human collecting systems can be reproduced. The fluoroscopic triangulation process needed to target the calix of choice can be practiced successfully in this model.\nThis silicone PCNL training model accurately replicates the anatomic architecture and orientation of the human renal collecting system.

{"title": "Auxetic oesophageal stents: structure and mechanical properties.", "abstract": "Oesophageal cancer is the ninth leading cause of malignant cancer death and its prognosis remains poor, ranking as the sixth most frequent cause of death in the world. This research work aims to adopt an Auxetic (rotating-squares) geometry device, that had previously been examined theoretically and analysed by Grima and Evans (J Mater Sci Lett 19(17):1563-1565, 2000), to produce a novel Auxetic oesophageal stent and stent-grafts relevant to the palliative treatment of oesophageal cancer and also for the prevention of dysphagia. This paper discusses the manufacture of a small diameter Auxetic oesophageal stent and stent-graft. The oral deployment of such an Auxetic stent would be simplest if a commercial balloon dilatational catheter was used as this obviates the need for an expensive dedicated delivery system. A novel manufacturing route was employed in this research to develop both Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents, which ranged from conventional subtractive techniques to a new additive manufacturing method. Polyurethane was selected as a material for the fabrication of Auxetic films and Auxetic oesophageal stents because of its good biocompatibility and non-toxicological properties. The Auxetic films were later used for the fabrication of seamed Auxetic oesophageal stents. The flexible polyurethane tubular grafts were also attached to the inner luminal side of the seamless Auxetic oesophageal stents, in order to prevent tumour in-growth. Scanning electron microscopy was used to conduct surface morphology study by using different Auxetic specimens developed from different conventional and new additive manufacturing techniques. Tensile testing of the Auxetic films was performed to characterise their mechanical properties. The stent expansion tests of the Auxetic stents were done to analyse the longitudinal extension and radial expansion of the Auxetic stent at a range of radial pressures applied by the balloon catheter, and to also identify the pressure values where the Auxetic stent fails. Finite element models of both Auxetic film and Auxetic stent were developed, and the results were compared with experimental results with a good agreement. The tensile testing of the Auxetic polyurethane films revealed that the Poisson's ratio of the sample ranged between -0.87 and -0.963 at different uniaxial tensile load values. From the stent expansion test, it was found that the Auxetic oesophageal stent radially expanded from 0.5 to 5.73\u00a0mm and longitudinally extended from 0.15 to 1.83\u00a0mm at a range of applied pressure increments (0.5-2.7\u00a0bar) from the balloon catheter.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

A microscopic grid network was created by rapid prototyping making a 3D-fused deposition model (FDM-PCL). Afterward, the FDM-PCL scaffolds were infused with a mixture of PCL, water, and 1,4-dioxane and underwent a thermal-induced phase separation (TIPS) followed by lyophilization. The TIPS process lead to a nanoporous structure shielded by the printed microstructure (NSP-PCL). Sixteen Landrace pigs were divided into two groups with 8 and 12 weeks follow-up, respectively.

Influences of laser power, scanning speed and concentration of BN on the microstructure, mechanical, in vitro tribological and biological properties of the coatings were investigated. Microstructural analysis of the composite coatings showed that the high temperature generated due to laser interaction with Ti6Al4V alloy and BN results in situ formation of TiB and TiN phases. With increasing BN concentration, from 5wt% to 15wt%, the Young's modulus of the composite coatings, measured by nanoindentation, increased from 170\u00b15GPa to 204\u00b114GPa.

In a previous paper, we computationally determined how best to design and use an instrumented spatial linkage (ISL) to locate the F-E and LR axes such that rotational and translational errors were minimized. However, the ISL was not built and consequently was not calibrated; thus the errors in locating these axes were not quantified on an actual ISL. Moreover, previous methods to calibrate an ISL used calibration devices with accuracies that were either undocumented or insufficient for the device to serve as a gold-standard. Accordingly, the objectives were to (1) construct an ISL using the previously established guidelines,(2) calibrate the ISL using an improved method, and (3) quantify the error in measuring changes in the F-E and LR axes. A 3D printed ISL was constructed and calibrated using a coordinate measuring machine, which served as a gold standard. Validation was performed using a fixture that represented the tibiofemoral joint with an adjustable F-E axis and the errors in measuring changes to the positions and orientations of the F-E and LR axes were quantified. The resulting root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the calibration residuals using the new calibration method were 0.24, 0.33, and 0.15\u2009mm for the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and proximal-distal positions, respectively, and 0.11, 0.10, and 0.09\u2009deg for varus-valgus, flexion-extension, and internal-external orientations, respectively. All RMSEs were below 0.29% of the respective full-scale range. When measuring changes to the F-E or LR axes, each orientation error was below 0.5\u2009deg; when measuring changes in the F-E axis, each position error was below 1.0\u2009mm. The largest position RMSE was when measuring a medial-lateral change in the LR axis (1.2\u2009mm). Despite the large size of the ISL, these calibration residuals were better than those for previously published ISLs, particularly when measuring orientations, indicating that using a more accurate gold standard was beneficial in limiting the calibration residuals.

Both these issues are addressed by demonstrating a method for preparing biodegradable and photo-patternable constructs, where modified cellulose is cross-linked to form an insoluble structure in an aqueous environment. Specifically, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is rendered photocrosslinkable by grafting with methylacrylic anhydride, whose linkages also render the cross-linked construct hydrolytically degradable. The HPC is then cross-linked via a photolithography-based fabrication process. The feasibility of functionalizing these HPC structures with biochemical cues is verified post-fabrication, and shown to facilitate the adhesion of mesenchymal progenitor cells. The HPC constructs are shown to be biocompatible and hydrolytically degradable, thus enabling cell proliferation and cell migration, and therefore constituting an ideal candidate for long-term cell culture and implantable tissue scaffold applications.

AM-made samples displayed higher bending strengths (\u22481.2-1.4 times greater than CS-made samples), whereas elastic constant (i.e., effective elastic modulus of the porous structures) that is determined by material elastic modulus and structural geometry of the samples was \u22481.9-2.3 times greater for AM-made samples. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that samples made by either method displayed the same crystal structure forming \u03b2-CPP after sinter annealing. The material elastic modulus, E, determined using nanoindentation tests also showed the same value for both sample types (i.e., E \u2248 64 GPa). Examination of the porous structures indicated that significantly larger sinter necks resulted in the AM-made samples which presumably resulted in the higher mechanical properties. The development of mechanical properties was attributed to the different sinter anneal procedures required to make 35 vol % porous samples by the two methods.

{"title": "High precision anatomy for MEG.", "abstract": "Precise MEG estimates of neuronal current flow are undermined by uncertain knowledge of the head location with respect to the MEG sensors. This is either due to head movements within the scanning session or systematic errors in co-registration to anatomy. Here we show how such errors can be minimized using subject-specific head-casts produced using 3D printing technology. The casts fit the scalp of the subject internally and the inside of the MEG dewar externally, reducing within session and between session head movements. Systematic errors in matching to MRI coordinate system are also reduced through the use of MRI-visible fiducial markers placed on the same cast. Bootstrap estimates of absolute co-registration error were of the order of 1mm. Estimates of relative co-registration error were <1.5mm between sessions. We corroborated these scalp based estimates by looking at the MEG data recorded over a 6month period. We found that the between session sensor variability of the subject's evoked response was of the order of the within session noise, showing no appreciable noise due to between-session movement. Simulations suggest that the between-session sensor level amplitude SNR improved by a factor of 5 over conventional strategies. We show that at this level of coregistration accuracy there is strong evidence for anatomical models based on the individual rather than canonical anatomy; but that this advantage disappears for errors of greater than 5mm. This work paves the way for source reconstruction methods which can exploit very high SNR signals and accurate anatomical models; and also significantly increases the sensitivity of longitudinal studies with MEG.", "journal": "NeuroImage", "date": "2013-08-06", "authors": ["LuziaTroebinger", "Jos\u00e9 DavidL\u00f3pez", "AntoineLutti", "DavidBradbury", "SvenBestmann", "GarethBarnes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.07.065"}

{"title": "Imaging requirements for medical applications of additive manufacturing.", "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM), formerly known as rapid prototyping, is steadily shifting its focus from industrial prototyping to medical applications as AM processes, bioadaptive materials, and medical imaging technologies develop, and the benefits of the techniques gain wider knowledge among clinicians. This article gives an overview of the main requirements for medical imaging affected by needs of AM, as well as provides a brief literature review from existing clinical cases concentrating especially on the kind of radiology they required. As an example application, a pair of CT images of the facial skull base was turned into 3D models in order to illustrate the significance of suitable imaging parameters. Additionally, the model was printed into a preoperative medical model with a popular AM device. Successful clinical cases of AM are recognized to rely heavily on efficient collaboration between various disciplines - notably operating surgeons, radiologists, and engineers. The single main requirement separating tangible model creation from traditional imaging objectives such as diagnostics and preoperative planning is the increased need for anatomical accuracy in all three spatial dimensions, but depending on the application, other specific requirements may be present as well. This article essentially intends to narrow the potential communication gap between radiologists and engineers who work with projects involving AM by showcasing the overlap between the two disciplines.", "journal": "Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)", "date": "2013-08-01", "authors": ["EeroHuotilainen", "MarkkuPaloheimo", "MikaSalmi", "Kaija-StiinaPaloheimo", "RoyBj\u00f6rkstrand", "JukkaTuomi", "AnttiMarkkola", "AnttiM\u00e4kitie"], "doi": "10.1177/0284185113494198"}

The novel devices were optimized for 3 biomechanistic targets exploiting computer-aided design and additive manufacturing. A third standard device was used as the comparator (standard foot orthosis [SFO]). Foot and ankle biomechanical effects were compared. Adverse reactions, orthotic fit and comfort, and short-term symptom benefits were also monitored.\nBoth FDM (P = 0.028) and SLS (P < 0.0001) orthoses significantly reduced peak rearfoot motion in comparison to shod. The average ankle internal moment was significantly decreased in the SFO (P = 0.010) and approached significance in the SLS (P = 0.052) orthosis. SFO, FDM, and SLS orthoses significantly increased the peak height of the medial foot arch between 3.6 to 4.4 mm (P < 0.001). Peak pressures in the medial (P = 0.018) and lateral forefoot (P = 0.022) regions of interest were significantly reduced for the SLS orthosis. SFO, FDM, and SLS orthoses significantly increased midfoot contact area (P < 0.001 for all conditions). In comparison to SFO, SLS and FDM orthoses provided equivalent or better patient experience. No adverse reactions were reported.\nFunctional optimization is a feasible approach for orthoses prescription in early RA and has the potential to provide superior mode-of-action responses for biomechanical therapeutic targets compared to standard devices.", "journal": "Arthritis care & research", "date": "2013-07-10", "authors": ["Kellie SGibson", "JamesWoodburn", "DuncanPorter", "ScottTelfer"], "doi": "10.1002/acr.22060"}
{"title": "3D printing of rat salivary glands: The submandibular-sublingual complex.", "abstract": "The morphology and the functionality of the murid glandular complex, composed of the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands (SSC), were the object of several studies conducted mainly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using a 4.7 T scanner and a manganese-based contrast agent, we improved the signal-to-noise ratio of the SSC relating to the surrounding anatomical structures allowing to obtain high-contrast 3D images of the SSC. In the last few years, the large development in resin melting techniques opened the way for printing 3D objects starting from a 3D stack of images. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of the 3D printing technique of soft tissues such as the SSC in the rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth, excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia. An immediate application of this technique is represented by educational classes.", "journal": "Anatomia, histologia, embryologia", "date": "2013-07-05", "authors": ["M PCecchini", "MParnigotto", "FMerigo", "PMarzola", "ADaducci", "STambalo", "FBoschi", "LColombo", "ASbarbati"], "doi": "10.1111/ahe.12074"}
{"title": "Magnetic-directed patterning of cell spheroids.", "abstract": "We have described an approach to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) cell-based structures using functionalized super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as patterning agents to guide the assembly of endothelial cell spheroids into 3D patterns using the magnetic forces generated by a prefabricated magnetic template. SPIONs were first uptaken by endothelial cells before they were assembled into uniform-sized spheroids through a home-made robotic spheroid maker. To guide the magnetic spheroids, a unique magnetic template was fabricated using computer-aided design and cut from a magnetic sheet. The spheroids were then guided to the prefabricated magnetic template through the attractive magnetic forces between the SPIONs inside the endothelial cells and the magnetic template. Fusion of endothelial cell spheroids over time while adhered to the magnetic template allowed for the formation of 3D cell-based structures. Subsequent removal of the prefabricated magnetic template left 3-D endothelial cell sheets, which may be stacked to fabricate complicated 3D multicellular tissue structures. To enhance the cytocompatibility, SPIONs were silica-coated before use. At low concentrations, the SPIONs did not adversely affect cell viability, proliferation, and phenotype stability. Light and confocal microscopy showed that endothelial cell spheroids could be reproducibly created with high uniformity. The endothelial cells were able to remain viable and maintain the 3D structure in vitro. We have proved the concept to use SPIONs as a patterning agent to direct the attachment and self assembly of SPION-loaded endothelial cell spheroids on a prefabricated magnetic template for the formation of 3D cell based structures. A magnetic-directed technique allows quick patterning of cell spheroids in accordance with desirable magnetic patterns, therefore, holding promise for scalable fabrication of complicated 3D multicellular tissue structures. By varying the cell types and the prefabricated magnetic patterns, this magnetic-directed patterning strategy may find use in bioprinting and multicellular tissue graft fabrication.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Staging the self-assembly process: inspiration from biological development.", "abstract": "One of the practical challenges facing the creation of self-assembling systems is being able to exploit a limited set of fixed components and their bonding mechanisms. The method of staging divides the self-assembly process into time intervals, during which components can be added to, or removed from, an environment at each interval. Staging addresses the challenge of using components that lack plasticity by encoding the construction of a target structure in the staging algorithm itself and not exclusively in the design of the components. Previous staging strategies do not consider the interplay between component physical features (morphological information). In this work we use morphological information to stage the self-assembly process, during which components can only be added to their environment at each time interval, to demonstrate our concept. Four experiments are presented, which use heterogeneous, passive, mechanical components that are fabricated using 3D printing. Two orbital shaking environments are used to provide energy to the components and to investigate the role of morphological information with component movement in either two or three spatial dimensions. The benefit of our staging strategy is shown by reducing assembly errors and exploiting bonding mechanisms with rotational properties. As well, a doglike target structure is used to demonstrate in theory how component information used at an earlier time interval can be reused at a later time interval, inspired by the use of a body plan in biological development. We propose that a staged body plan is one method toward scaling self-assembling systems with many interacting components. The experiments and body plan example demonstrate, as proof of concept, that staging enables the self-assembly of more complex morphologies not otherwise possible.", "journal": "Artificial life", "date": "2013-02-05", "authors": ["NavneetBhalla", "Peter JBentley", "Peter DVize", "ChristianJacob"], "doi": "10.1162/ARTL_a_00095"}
{"title": "Induction of bone formation in biphasic calcium phosphate scaffolds by bone morphogenetic protein-2 and primary osteoblasts.", "abstract": "Bone tissue engineering strategies mainly depend on porous scaffold materials. In this study, novel biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) matrices were generated by 3D-printing. High porosity was achieved by starch consolidation. This study aimed to characterise the porous BCP-scaffold properties and interactions of osteogenic cells and growth factors under in vivo conditions. Five differently treated constructs were implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic rats: plain BCP constructs (group A), constructs pre-treated with BMP-2 (group B; 1.6\u2009\u00b5g BMP-2 per scaffold), seeded with primary osteoblasts (OB) (group C), seeded with OB and BMP-2 (group D) and constructs seeded with OB and pre-cultivated in a flow bioreactor for 6\u2009weeks (group E). After 2, 4 and 6\u2009weeks, specimens were explanted and subjected to histological and molecular biological analyses. Explanted scaffolds were invaded by fibrovascular tissue without significant foreign body reactions. Morphometric analysis demonstrated significantly increased bone formation in samples from group D (OB\u2009+\u2009BMP-2) compared to all other groups. Samples from groups B-E displayed significant mRNA expression of bone-specific genes after 6\u2009weeks. Pre-cultivation in the flow bioreactor (group E) induced bone formation comparable with group B. In this study, differences in bone distribution between samples with BMP-2 or osteoblasts could be observed. In conclusion, combination of osteoblasts and BMP-2 synergistically enhanced bone formation in novel ceramic scaffolds.
