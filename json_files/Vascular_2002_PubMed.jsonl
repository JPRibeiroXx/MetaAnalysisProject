The first patient developed an infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and meningitis after undergoing a translabyrinthine resection of an acoustic neuroma. The second patient had a history of a gunshot wound to the temporal bone, with a large defect and an infected cholesteatoma that caused several episodes of meningitis. The third through the fifth patients had persistent CSF leakage and infection refractory to conventional therapy. In all cases prior attempts of closure with fat grafts or regional flaps had failed. Rectus abdominis myofascial free flap, radial forearm free flap or a gracilis muscle free flap was used after debridement of the infected cavities. The CSF leaks, local infections, and meningitis were controlled within a week. In our experience, microvascular free tissue provides the necessary bulk of viable, well-vascularized tissue, which not only assures a mechanical seal but also helps clear the local infection.", "journal": "Skull base : official journal of North American Skull Base Society ...

{"title": "Interactions of human blood and tissue cell types with 95-nm-high nanotopography.", "abstract": "Two of the major concerns for tissue engineering materials are inflammatory responses from blood cells and fibrous encapsulation by the body in order to shield the implant from blood reaction. A further hurdle is that of vascularization. In order to develop new tissues, or to repair parts of the vascular system, nutrients need to be carried to the basal cell layers. If a material promotes tissue formation, but not vascularization, necrosis will be observed as multilayered cells develop. In this paper, polymer demixed island topography with a 95-nm Z axis was tested using human mononuclear blood cells, platelets, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. The results showed no difference in blood response between the islands and the flat controls, suggesting that in vivo there would be negligible immunological difference. Fibroblasts reacted by changing morphology into a rounded shape with thick processes and poorly developed cytoskeleton. Retardation of fibroblast growth may be an advantageous, as it is this cell type that forms the fibrous capsule, preventing growth of the required tissue type. Finally, endothelial cells were seen to form arcuate, or curved, morphologies in response to the islands. This is the normal, in vivo, morphology for vascular endothelium. This result suggests that the nano-features are promoting a more phenotypically correct morphology.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on nanobioscience", "date": "2006-05-13", "authors": ["Matthew JDalby", "George EMarshall", "Heather J HJohnstone", "StanleyAffrossman", "Mathis ORiehle"], "doi": "10.1109/tnb.2002.806933"}

The incidence of nonunion is greater in this region, in which the vascularity of the proximal fracture segment is compromised and the proximal fragment is small and resists rigid fixation. Recent development of better vascularized bone grafting techniques has provided a tool with which to address this vexing problem. Because many authors had previously shown the advantage of rigid fixation in obtaining scaphoid union, it seemed advantageous to us to combine these two methods-rigid fixation and improved vascularity. In this article, we present in detail our technique for treating patients with very small proximal pole fractures in which the proximal fragment makes up less than 20% of the scaphoid. For practical purposes, all of these fractures have a proximal fragment that is avascular. We use a vascularized bone graft as described by Zaidemberg et al. in combination with more rigid fixation of proximal pole fractures using the Herbert mini screw. Although the technique presented requires the surgeon to use precise surgical technique, early results have been encouraging, and patients with very small fracture fragments can be treated successfully.", "journal": "Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery", "date": "2006-03-08", "authors": ["Arshad RMuzaffar", "Peter RCarter"], "doi": "10.1097/00130911-200209000-00010"}
{"title": "Skull base reconstruction after anterior subcranial tumor resection.", "abstract": "The goal of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of a simple and reliable technique for anterior skull base and craniofacial reconstruction in patients who have undergone excision of tumors via the subcranial approach.\nThere were 63 patients who had undergone 71 anterior skull base resections of tumors via the aforementioned approach. Twenty-nine cases (41%) involved malignant tumors and 42 (59%) involved benign tumors. Reconstruction of the anterior skull base was performed by a single team who used double-layer fascial graft. Limited dural defects were reconstructed using the temporalis fascia, whereas large anterior skull base defects were reconstructed using a fascia lata sheath. Reconstruction was achieved without the support of bone graft or titanium mesh and without pericranial, galeal, or free flaps. Pericranial flap wrapping of the frontonasoorbital segment was performed to prevent osteoradionecrosis if postoperative radiotherapy was planned. The incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, intracranial infection, and tension pneumocephalus was 5.6%. Histopathological examination of fascia lata grafts obtained in patients who had undergone a second procedure demonstrated integration of vascularized fibrous tissue to the graft, as well as local proliferation of a newly formed vascular layer embedding the fascial sheath.\nThe use of a double-layer fascial graft alone was adequate for prevention of CSF leakage, meningitis, tension pneumocephalus, and brain herniation. The double-layer fascial flap provided a simple and reliable means for anterior skull base reconstruction after en bloc resection of both malignant and benign tumors.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2005-08-27", "authors": ["Dan MFliss", "ZivGil", "SergeySpektor", "LeonorLeider-Trejo", "AvrahamAbergel", "AviKhafif", "AharonAmir", "EyalGur", "Jacob TCohen"], "doi": "10.3171/foc.2002.12.5.11"}

The vast experience of performing 1155 reconstructive surgical procedures at Prva hirurska klinika (First surgical clinic), part of Belgrade Medical Faculty, enables the author to reflect upon options and limitations of such operations. There is a considerable discrepancy between the results obtained from reconstructive surgery of the oesophagus and the cardia affected by malignant growths, and form treatment of benign strictures of the oesophagus--the latter producing significantly better results. Digestive tract tissue used in the reconstructive surgery, is applicable depending on the pathological condition, its location, the possibility of isolating a sufficiently long section, and its adequate vascularization. Best results were achieved when a segment of thejejunum was used, but only for distal lesions of the oesophagus. Good results were achieved also when segments of the colon were used, the left colon proving more useful than the right one. Stomach tissue produced the worst results in a series of reconstructions, because it was used primarily in cases where the oesophagus was affected by malignant growths. When comparing the data from this series with the findings from the world literature, we come to almost identical results as in cases of reconstructive surgery of the oesophagus affected with carcinoma.

For post-traumatic defects recent advances in other techniques for cartilage repair and resurfacing have reduced the role of allograft tissue transplantation to defects larger than 3 cm in diameter and 1 cm in depth.A fresh osteochondral allograft that has been harvested from a donor within 24 h from death and preserved in 4 degrees C for up to 4 days shows 100% viability of the cartilage. The avascular bone remains structurally intact and mechanically strong until it is replaced by host bone or until it is weakened or absorbed. The indications for fresh osteochondral allografts for reconstructive surgery of the articular surface of the knee do not justify the use of immunosuppressive drugs and we therefore believe that surgical vascularization of the grafts should not be carried out.This clinical approach can provide a reconstructive solution for younger higher demand patients where implants are not desirable and arthrodesis is not acceptable.

{"title": "Local adjustment of blood and lymph circulation in the hormonal regulation of reproduction in female pigs--facts, conclusions and suggestions for future research.", "abstract": "Arteries, veins, capillaries and lymphatic vessels situated in the mesovarium and mesosalpinx of domestic animal species (pig, cow, sheep) form the periovarian vascular complex. Particular components of the periovarian vascular complex interact functionally and morphologically creating a specific environment for numerous physiological processes. The complex plays an essential role in the system of the retrograde transfer of the ovarian hormones. This phenomenon is especially well documented in pigs. The efficiency of the retrograde transfer of estradiol and progesterone from blood and lymph leaving the gonad to blood of the ovarian artery (expressed as percentage of their concentration in the ovarian venous blood) as well as the rate of the retrograde transfer of these hormones to the ovary (measured in nanograms or picograms per minute) is presented and discussed in this paper. No simple relationship was found between hormone concentration in ovarian venous effluent and the efficiency or the rate of their retrograde transfer during the estrous cycle. It appears that two processes contribute to the highly efficient retrograde transfer of ovarian hormones into the ovary in the periovarian vascular complex: 1/ direct hormone permeation from the ovarian vein into the adjacent branches of the ovarian artery through the counter-current mechanism; 2/ indirect permeation of ovarian hormones consisting of two stages. The first stage includes the permeation of hormones from lymph leaving the ovary via the subovarian lymphatic vascular network as well as lymph and venous blood, leaving the mesosalpinx and going to capillaries and tiny venous vessels in the entire mesovarium. These tiny mesovarium vessels connect and then branch out again to form the veno-venous network on the surface of branches of the ovarian artery. The second stage includes the permeation of hormones from the veno-venous blood into the branches of the ovarian artery. The authors present a hypothesis that the retrograde transfer of ovarian hormones may participate in the feedback regulation of ovarian function. The relationship between the retrograde transfer of ovarian hormones in the area of periovarian vascular complex and local elevation of steroid hormone concentrations in blood supplying the oviduct and uterus is presented.

Patients enrolled in this study were treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, Pomeranian Academy of Medicine in Szczecin, for cancer, injuries, developmental anomalies and atrophic changes. In each case it was necessary to restore facial bone structures of functional and aesthetic importance, including: floor of the orbital cavity, alveolar process of maxilla, palate, malar bone and mandible (Tab. 2). Reconstruction was done mostly with parietal bone grafts pedicled on temporal fascia and muscle, coronoid process of the mandible pedicled on temporal muscle, and lower part of the diaphysis of mandible pedicled on masseter and pterygoid muscles. In some cases, reconstruction material consisted of a rib on greater pectoral muscle, clavicle on sternocleidomastoid muscle and scapular bone crest pedicled on trapezius muscle. Free microvascular flaps with some elements of fibula and radius were used in two patients for the reconstruction of mandible and soft tissues. In total, 41 vascularised grafts were performed in 40 patients. Graft healing was examined clinically and usefulness of this technique for face reconstruction surgery was assessed basing on author's experience with the preparation technique, intraoperative complications and extent of trauma to donor sites. The results of healing of specific grafts are enclosed in Table 1. The surgical technique for graft preparation and its transfer into the recipient site varied from case to case. The most difficult and effortful approach was with free bone grafts transferred from remote sites by means of a microsurgical technique (group V). Despite the complexity of the reconstruction method, no intraoperative complications occurred in the course of preparation of the radial and fibular bone grafts. In group IV, the most difficult grafts included those taken from ribs, clavicle and scapular bone. Parietal bone grafts were much less troublesome (subgroups Ia and Ib) although associated with the largest number of intraoperative complications. The easiest preparation method applied to the grafting of coronoid process and lower part of the body of mandible (group II and III). Clinical evaluation of vascularised bone grafts confirmed without reservations the value of this approach in face reconstruction surgery. However, the extent to which individual graft types proved to be usable varied. The most valuable ones included parietal bone grafts pedicled on temporal muscle and fascia used for restoring upper and central facial structures and the coronoid process of mandible pedicled on temporal muscle used for reconstructing the floor of the orbital cavity and alveolar process of the maxilla. Rib grafts pedicled on pectoral muscle were of limited use. The same applies to grafts from the lower part of the body of mandible pedicled on masseter and pterygoid muscles occasionally used for restoring the mental part of mandible.

{"title": "Cerebellar susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice: potential interaction of immunology with vascular anatomy.", "abstract": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is utilized as an animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS). In both EAE and MS, activated T-lymphocytes specific for self-antigens present in myelin are linked to CNS inflammation and the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to peripheral blood leukocytes and plasma proteins, predominately in myelin rich white matter. One aspect of MS that has received relatively little attention is the finding that certain CNS regions are more likely than others to develop disease in different patient populations. Understanding the factors predisposing specific brain regions to autoimmune attack, or protecting other regions, would provide a better understanding of the disease as a process, and may also offer additional targets for therapeutic development. EAE offers a model to search for these factors and the first step in such a process is to identify the brain regions that are susceptible to EAE. Until recently the spinal cord in rodents has been considered the region most susceptible to EAE, with disease in more rostral regions occurring later and with reduced severity. However a more recent study has shown that the cerebellum of SJL/J mice, like the spinal cord, is especially susceptible to BBB breakdown in EAE. Although many factors known to be involved in BBB formation and breakdown remain to be assessed for their possible role in increasing the susceptibility of the cerebellum, one potentially important factor is the location of venules, which are the most affected vascular elements in inflamed tissue. There is a prevalence of large EAE susceptible venules traveling in the myelin rich white matter tracts in SJL/J mouse cerebellar cortex, indicating that the vascularization of this tissue may contribute to the increased susceptibility to inflammation in response to autoimmune attacks directed against CNS myelin.", "journal": "Cerebellum (London, England)", "date": "2003-07-26", "authors": ["James RTonra"], "doi": "10.1080/147342202753203096"}

Even in meningiomas, with their very variable firmness, vascularization, and adherence to the surrounding brain, accurate dissection could be achieved. However, while tumor separation from the brain was attained with high accuracy and vessel preservation in all cases, only in softer lesions resection by aspiration under vessel preservation was possible with pressures below 20 bar. In all, the waterjet device enables precise tissue dissection and vessel preservation in various pathologies including meningiomas. It could represent an addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium. Further studies will have to show dissection qualities of this device that are superior to conventional methods.", "journal": "Neurosurgical review", "date": "2003-07-08", "authors": ["JoachimOertel", "Michael RobertGaab", "RolfWarzok", "J\u00fcrgenPiek"], "doi": "10.1007/s10143-002-0244-7"}
{"title": "Anaesthesia for shock wave therapy in musculoskeletal disorders: a preliminary report.", "abstract": "The potential for using external applied energy to rectify or ameliorate musculoskeletal disorders has been explored for decades. A shock wave is a pressure disturbance: tissue effect is cavitation, producing microtrauma or microfracture and haematoma formation, inducing, as to date is thought, increase in vascularization, increased soft callus and faster enchondral ossification. Anaesthesiological interest in this field is focused in non-union or delayed osseous union, joint stiffness or osteochondrosis and femoral head necrosis in adults. Actually, because of the pain associated with high energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy on bones, anaesthesia is necessary, but, since almost all patients have no complaint after treatment, there is no need of postoperative analgesia. Therefore, short duration anaesthetic techniques and agents should be preferred. Loco-regional anaesthesia or general anaesthesia are both suitable to the purpose. Fifty patients have been treated nowadays in our Institution with shock wave therapy needing anaesthesia. 18 patients (36%) received general anaesthesia. Since patient's stay in hospital was expected to be short, short duration agents have been used, avoiding those causing unpleasent side effects, first emesis. We used Propofol or Remifentanil by continuous infusion, titrated to maintain stable haemodynamics and an appropriate level of anaesthesia. The short duration of action of Propofol depends on its rapid elimination, whereas Remifentanil undergoes rapid biotransformation to minimally active metabolites. 32 patients (64%) received regional anaesthesia. We avoided long acting agents or high concentration drugs. Spinal blocks have been performed with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine; brachial plexus blocks, sciatic-femoral blocks and an epidural block have been performed with 0.5-1% xylocaine or 1% mepivacaine. Shock Wave Therapy has been done during a 3-day hospital stay. With suitable anaesthesiological treatment and preparation, almost all patients could be treated as outpatients or with an overnight hospital stay.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2003-06-05", "authors": ["FRodol\u00e0", "CConti", "CAbballe", "AChierichini", "FCiano", "EForte", "TIacobucci", "LSorrentino", "SVagnoni", "AVergari", "SD'Avolio"], "doi": null}
{"title": "[Ultrasonography in acute pelvic pain].", "abstract": "Acute pelvic pain may be the manifestation of various gynecologic and non-gynecologic disorders from less alarming rupture of the follicular cyst to life threatening conditions such as rupture of ectopic pregnancy or perforation of inflamed appendix. In order to construct an algorithm for differential diagnosis we divide acute pelvic pain into gynecologic and non-gynecologic etiology, which is than subdivided into gastrointestinal and urinary causes. Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency and should always be considered in differential diagnosis if appendix has not been removed. Apart of clinical examination and laboratory tests, an ultrasound examination is sensitive up to 90% and specific up to 95% if graded compression technique is used. Still it is user-depended and requires considerable experience in order to perform it reliably. Meckel's diverticulitis, acute terminal ileitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis and functional bowel disease are conditions that should be differentiated from other causes of low abdominal pain by clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging tests. Dilatation of renal pelvis and ureter are typical signs of obstructive uropathy and may be efficiently detected by ultrasound. Additional thinning of renal parenchyma suggests long-term obstructive uropathy. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, salpingitis and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts are three most commonly diagnosed gynecologic conditions presenting as an acute abdomen. Degenerating leiomyomas and adnexal torsion occur less frequently. For better systematization, gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain could be divided into conditions with negative pregnancy test and conditions with positive pregnancy test. Pelvic inflammatory disease may be ultrasonically presented with numerous signs such as thickening of the tubal wall, incomplete septa within the dilated tube, demonstration of hyperechoic mural nodules, free fluid in the \"cul-de-sac\" etc. Color Doppler ultrasound contributes to more accurate diagnosis of this entity since it enables differentiation between acute and chronic stages based on analysis of the vascular resistance. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts may be presented by variety of ultrasound findings since intracystic echoes depend upon the quality and quantity of the blood clots. Color Doppler investigation demonstrates moderate to low vascular resistance typical of luteal flow. Leiomyomas undergoing degenerative changes are another cause of acute pelvic pain commonly present in patients of reproductive age. Color flow detects regularly separated vessels at the periphery of the leiomyoma, which exhibit moderate vascular resistance. Although the classic symptom of endometriosis is chronic pelvic pain, in some patients acute pelvic pain does occur. Most of these patients demonstrate an endometrioma or \"chocolate\" cyst containing diffuse carpet-like echoes. Sometimes, solid components may indicate even ovarian malignancy, but if color Doppler ultrasound is applied it is less likely to obtain false positive results. One should be aware that pericystic and/or hillar type of ovarian endometrioma vascularization facilitate correct recognition of this entity. Pelvic congestion syndrome is another condition that can cause an attack of acute pelvic pain. It is usually consequence of dilatation of venous plexuses, arteries or both systems. By switching color Doppler gynecologist can differentiate pelvic congestion syndrome from multilocular cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease or adenomyosis. Ovarian vein thrombosis is a potentially fatal disorder occurring most often in the early postpartal period. Hypercoagulability, infection and stasis are main etiologic factors, and transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound is an excellent diagnostic tool to diagnose it. Acute pelvic pain may occur even in normal intrauterine pregnancy. This may be explained by hormonal changes, rapid growth of the uterus and increased blood flow. Ultrasound is mandatory for distinguishing normal intrauterine pregnancy from threatened or spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy and other complications that may occur in patients with positive pregnancy test. Incomplete abortion is visualized as thickened and irregular endometrial echo with certain amount of intracavitary fluid. If applied, color Doppler ultrasound reveals low vascular resistance signals in richly perfused intracavitary area. Transvaginal sonography has high sensitivity and specificity in visualization of uterine and adnexal signs of ectopic pregnancy. Color Doppler examination may aid in detection of the peritrophoblastic flow. Furthermore, it facilitates detection of ectopic living embryo, tubal ring or unspecific adnexal tumor. Corpus luteum cysts and leiomyomas are another cause of pelvic pain during pregnancy, which can be correctly diagnosed by ultrasound. Detection of uterine dehiscence and rupture in patients with history of prior surgical intervention on uterine wall relies exclusively on correct ultrasound diagnosis. In patients with placental abruption sonographer detects hypoechoic complex representing either retroplacental hematoma, subchorionic hematoma or subamniotic hemorrhage. In closing, ultrasound has already become important and easily available tool which can efficiently recognize patients with possibly threatening conditions of different origins.", "journal": "Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti", "date": "2003-05-29", "authors": ["SanjaKupesi\u0107", "AlenkaAksamija", "NiksaVuci\u0107", "AnaTripalo", "AsimKurjak"], "doi": null}
{"title": "[ECG mapping in clinical practice].", "abstract": "First the authors present a review of important cornerstones in the history of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECG mapping. The first to describe the electric cardiac field based on twenty ECGs was A.D. Waller in 1889. The decisive cornerstone for practical use was the introduction of a string galvanometer in 1901 by W. Einthoven and his triaxial lead system. Another very important cornerstone in the development of ECG were the findings of F.N. Wilson. Merits as regards the development and application of ECG mapping are due to B. Taccardi. Workers of the Second Medical Clinic in Prague enhanced after 15 years of studies and comparison of ECG maps with coronarographic findings in subjects with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and microvascular coronary dysfunction (syndrome X--SyX) substantially the specificity of this method in impaired myocardial vascularization. Better diagnosis was achieved by introduction of diagnostic tests which influence coronary vascularization such as e.g. hyperventilation, as well as other tests. After their application progression of chronic myocardial ischaemia occurs, e.g. by the mechanism of the \"steal phenomenon\" or restriction of the microcirculation after hyperventilation in patients with SyX. Furthermore the authors present examples of ECG maps after PTCA, after application of diagnostic tests in IHD and SyX and also regression of myocardial ischaemia after marked reduction of total cholesterol.", "journal": "Vnitrni lekarstvi", "date": "2003-05-15", "authors": ["FBoud\u00edk", "MAschermann", "ZAnger"], "doi": null}

Several parameters affect clinical trials in PDT and influence the therapeutic outcome. A potentially major application of PDT in a non-cancer field is its use in treatment of age-related macular degeneration. This condition, caused by proliferation of neovasculature in the retina, is the major cause of blindness in the over 50s. Using a photosensitiser which enters neovasculature very rapidly following administration and is subsequently quickly moved from the circulation. Ocular neovascular disease represents an important cause of blindness today. In this paper, was used an animal model (rabbit) to evaluate the vaso-occlusive potential of photodynamic therapy with B2 vitamin. Neovascularization induced in the rabbit cornea consists of an easily accessible monolayer-like neovascular net within a transparent matrix. This fact allows studying the efficiency of occlusion in an isolated neovascular structure.", "journal": "Oftalmologia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)", "date": "2003-05-02", "authors": ["M AIoni\u0163\u0103", "R MIon", "BC\u00e2rstocea", "O LGafencu", "V I RNiculescu"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Transoral carbon-dioxide laser resection of hypopharyngeal carcinoma.", "abstract": "In hypopharyngeal carcinoma, open partial resection is rarely feasible because of the high rate of chronic aspiration. Transoral laser surgery, however, is not associated with major swallowing problems. Between 1991 and 1995, a total of 29 patients with cancer of the hypopharynx were treated using laser surgical resection. In 25 patients, a neck dissection was performed, and 26 patients were radiated postoperatively. The 5-year overall survival was 48% and tumor-related survival 58%. The outcome was significantly ( P<0.048) dependent on the preoperative lymph node status (N(0)=74%, N(+)=34% overall survival). Accordingly, the 5-year survival in stage I and stage II tumors was 71% and in stage III and IV tumors 47%. The highest local control rate was achieved in patients with carcinoma of the hypopharyngeal walls. A major advantage of laser surgery is that resurfacing of the wounds takes place per secundam. No reconstructions with free vascularized grafts have to be performed. There were no functional deficits regarding speech and swallowing in 94%, 100% and 100% of the surviving patients without local recurrence after 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. No patient had to have a tracheostomy intraoperatively. Laser surgical treatment in combination with neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy of selected patients with early cancer of the hypopharynx shows comparable results with open surgical procedures and is superior to radiotherapy alone.

These tendons have unique properties, as well as several features common to calcifying cartilage and bone in other vertebrate species. In cartilage and bone, mineralization has been associated with a vascular and microvascular origin, but such a relationship has not been established in the avian tendon. Here the vasculature and mineral deposition in the calcifying leg tendon of the turkey have been documented for the first time utilizing a combination of histology, immunochemistry, radiology, and novel three-dimensional image reconstruction methods based on computed tomography. The data describe the blood supply to turkey leg tendon and show that the vascularity of this tissue is correlated with the onset of mineralization: At local levels of structural hierarchy, a vascular bed precedes mineral formation and the sites of vascular invasion correspond spatially with those of mineral deposition. Relatively unvascularized tendon regions remain uncalcified. These results support the concept that vascularization and mineralization are functionally related in the tendon, and they suggest that vascular invasion provides a mechanism underlying subsequent mineral deposition in this tissue.", "journal": "Connective tissue research", "date": "2003-04-11", "authors": ["William JLandis", "Bonnie L HayKraus", "Carl AKirker-Head"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Role of IFN-gamma in allograft rejection.", "abstract": "Interferon (IFN)-gamma is a cytokine produced mostly by activated T cells and NK cells that has complex effects on immune and nonimmune cells. IFN-gamma plays important roles in inflammation, usually in synergy with other cytokines, such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. The uniqueness of IFN-gamma lies in its ability to induce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in many tissues, making it particularly relevant to transplantation. The results of graft rejection in the absence of IFN-gamma show that IFN-gamma modulates but is not essential for the allogeneic responses, suppressing generation of CTL. In vivo IFN-gamma has a protective role early in the response to vascularized organ allografts: transplants in mice have a tendency to develop necrosis when IFN-gamma is not available, apparently by failure of the microcirculation. The lack of IFN-gamma greatly reduces the induction of MHC in organ allografts, and it is possible that this is indirectly related to the protective effect of IFN-gamma. Nevertheless IFN-gamma also promotes graft vessel disease later in the course ofthe transplant. Thus IFN-gamma has diverse and potentially contradictory effects on organ allograft survival, acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself, the net effect depending on the graft type and the time post-transplant.", "journal": "Critical reviews in immunology", "date": "2003-04-08", "authors": ["Luis GHidalgo", "Philip FHalloran"], "doi": null}

NRPs bind members of the class 3 semaphorin family, regulators of neuronal guidance, and of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of angiogenesis factors. There is substantial evidence that NRPs serve as mediators of developmental and tumor angiogenesis. NRPs are expressed in endothelial cells (EC) and bind VEGF165. NRP1 is a co-receptor for VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) that enhances the binding of VEGF165 to VEGFR2 and VEGF165-mediated chemotaxis. NRP1 expression is regulated in EC by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, the transcription factors dHAND and Ets-1, and vascular injury. During avian blood vessel development NRP1 is expressed only in arteries whereas NRP2 is expressed in veins. Transgenic mouse models demonstrate that NRP1 plays a critical role in embryonic vascular development. Overexpression of NRP1 results in the formation of excess capillaries and hemorrhaging. NRP1 knockouts have defects in yolk sac, embryo and neuronal vascularization, and in development of large vessels in the heart. Tumor cells express NRPs and bind VEGF165. NRP1 upregulation is positively correlated with the progression of various tumors. Overexpression of NRPI in rat tumor cells results in enlarged tumors and substantially enhanced tumor angiogenesis. On the other hand, soluble NRP1 (sNRP1) is an antagonist of tumor angiogenesis. Semaphorin 3A binds to EC and tumor cells. It also inhibits EC motility and capillary sprouting in vitro. VEGF165 and Sema3A are competitive inhibitors for NRP1 mediated functions in EC and neurons.

From July 1978 to January 2001 we operated upon 92 boys with concealed penises; 49 had buried penises (BP), while PP of varying degrees was noted in 14. Of 29 patients with a trapped penis, phimosis was noted in 9, post-circumcision cicatrix (PCC) in 17, radical circumcision in 2, and posttraumatic scarring in 1. The BP was corrected at 2-3 years of age by incising the inner prepuce circumferentially, degloving the penis to the penopubic junction, dividing dysgenetic bands, and suturing the dermis of the penopubic skin to Buck's fascia with nonabsorbable sutures. Patients with PP required displacement of the scrotum in addition to correction of the BP. Phimosis was treated by circumcision. Patients with a PCC were recircumcised carefully, preserving normal skin, but Z-plasties and Byars flaps were often required for skin coverage. After radical circumcision and trauma, vascularized flaps were raised to cover the defect. Satisfactory results were obtained in all cases although 2 patients with BP required a second operation. The operation required to correct a concealed penis has to be tailored to its etiology.", "journal": "Pediatric surgery international", "date": "2003-02-25", "authors": ["JayantRadhakrishnan", "AsimRazzaq", "KannanManickam"], "doi": "10.1007/s00383-002-0770-y"}

Sixty-six cases were studied, 28 MSI+ and 38 MSI-. MSI phenotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction. MVD was assessed after CD31 staining in ten x400 fields (0.96 mm(2)) in the most vascularized areas. VEGF and COX-2 expression were studied by means of immunohistochemistry. MVD positively correlated with the levels of VEGF expression (P=10(-4)) and also with the levels of COX-2 expression (P=0.007). MVD and VEGF expression were lower in MSI+ carcinomas (P=0.002 and P=0.03 respectively). When mucinous tumors were excluded from the statistical analysis, the association between low MVD, low VEGF and MSI status disappeared (P=0.5, P=1, respectively). MSI+ mucinous carcinomas had a lower MVD and VEGF expression than other MSI+ carcinomas (P=0.008 and P=0.004, respectively) and MSI- mucinous carcinomas (P=0.01 and P=0.001, respectively). COX-2 expression was lower in medullary carcinomas (P=0.001). In conclusion, mucinous MSI+ colon carcinomas represent a special group of colon adenocarcinomas relating to angiogenesis, with a lower MVD and VEGF expression than both MSI- mucinous carcinomas and MSI+ non-mucinous carcinomas. A low COX-2 expression could be related to the medullary phenotype. However, this has to be confirmed in a larger series. Finally, the low MVD of MSI+ mucinous colon adenocarcinomas could participate in their overall better prognosis.", "journal": "Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology", "date": "2003-02-22", "authors": ["DominiqueWendum", "Pierre-YvesBo\u00eblle", "Val\u00e9rieRigau", "NicoleSebbagh", "SylvianeOlschwang", "NajatMourra", "RollandParc", "GermainTrugnan", "Jo\u00eblleMasliah", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisFl\u00e9jou"], "doi": "10.1007/s00428-002-0737-3"}
{"title": "Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.", "abstract": "This review considers the esophagectomy techniques in the treatment of esophageal cancer and provides the guidelines for optimizing the patients' chances at cure, minimizing the risk of mediastinal enteric leak (which carries a mortality rate as high as 50%) and minimizing associated pulmonary insufficiency and infection. The 4 most commonly used routes for resection and replacement include a transhiatal, transthoracic (Ivor-Lewis), tri-incisional (right chest then simultaneous abdominal and left neck), and left chest (distal tumors). Each of these techniques will be described as will the use of colon and jejunum for esophageal replacement. The healthy stomach is the preferred conduit for esophageal replacement. The stomach is well vascularized, easily reaches to the neck, and requires only a single anastomosis for re-establishing intestinal continuity. When the stomach is not available (usually because of prior surgery or disease) the choice of conduits include colon and jejunum. With respect to minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, several groups have significant experience with this and report excellent results. This is an evolving technique but holds much promise for improving the quality of life of patients with cancer without compromising their survival. In locally advanced middle third tumors, thoracotomy and dissection under direct vision's desirable and improves the safety of the operation. The same may apply to tumors receiving neoadjuvant therapy. For tumors of the distal esophagus, transhiatal, tri-incisional, and Ivor-Lewis resection are probably equally as safe, and appear to result in equivalent long-term survival. An intrathoracic anastomotic leak is disastrous, carrying a mortality rate of up to 50%. Any surgeon who performs esophagectomy with an intrathoracic anastomosis must do so with a low incidence of leakage, certainly under 5%. Consideration should be given to a cervical placement if there are factors increasing the risk such as the use of induction therapy.", "journal": "Minerva chirurgica", "date": "2003-02-20", "authors": ["S JSwanson", "PLinden"], "doi": null}

Them surgical treatment of scaphoid bone pseudoarthrosis has recently made great progress and the results achieved by the authors in this field are reported in this paper. These results are discussed in light of the results and opinions presented at the 8th Congress of the World Federation for Hand Surgery held in Istambul in June 2001 and are compared with the achievements made by other authors and published in the most recent relevant literature.\nAt our department, two standard surgical procedures are available to treat pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone that is free from deforming changes due to arthritis. One approach involves resection of the pseudoarthrosis and subsequent cancellous bone grafting, using osseous tissue from the styloid process of the radius and osteosynthesis with a navicular screw. The other procedure is a modified arthroplasty according to Dwyer and is applied to cases which show aseptic necrosis of the proximal bone fragment. The follow-up study of the patients treated between 1997 and 2001 included patients in whom the follow-up period was at least six months. The results were evaluated according to Pechlaner's rating system.\nA total of 26 patients were examined; the average time from the operation was 17 months. Of them, 24 underwent the primary treatment that involved resection of pseudoarthrosis followed by cancellous bone grafting and osteosynthesis with a screw. This primary operation healed the condition in 17 patients, but the rest of them had to undergo one or two more surgical procedures. Evaluation by Pechlaner's scoring system showed 14 excellent, five good, two sufficient and three poor outcomes of the treatment.\nThe pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone, its diagnosis, surgical treatment and different operative techniques are discussed. Special attention is paid to the use of either vascularized rotatory grafts or pedicled vascularized grafts. The follow-up results are compared with those of other orthopedic clinics and hospitals. Various aspects of further improvement in the treatment of this disease under current conditions are considered.\nThe results achieved in the treatment of pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone of the hand are comparable with those of other orthopedic hospitals. Adoption of more recent types of osteosyntheses in considered. For a potential introduction of the vascularized graft technique, the use of a vascularized graft collected from the dorsum of the distal radius is suggested. This method is also regarded as suitable for treatment of certain cases of aseptic necrosis of the lunate bone.", "journal": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "date": "2003-02-18", "authors": ["MLutonsk\u00fd", "DPellar"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Recombinant human erythropoietin influences revascularization and healing in a rat model of random ischaemic flaps.", "abstract": "In order to ascertain whether erythropoietin plays a role in early and late repair processes following ischaemic skin flap injury, a dorsal, caudally based skin flap was created in rats. The rats were successively divided into four groups. Group 1 was not treated. The other groups were treated with a subcutaneous administration of 0.9% NaCl saline solution (group 2), a subcutaneous administration of vehicle (group 3) or a subcutaneous administration of 300 IU/kg/day of recombinant human erythropoietin (group 4). We evaluated the possible relationships between neutrophil accumulation, myeloperoxidase activity and content in flap tissue, flap survival, flap temperature (using telethermography) and flap revascularization (using videocapillaroscopy). Necrosis in the flap was significantly less extensive in group 4 than in groups 1, 2 and 3. A significant increase in neutrophil infiltration occurred between the 1st and 24th hour in these groups, but this was not observed in group 4. These findings were confirmed by biochemical data of myeloperoxidase activity and malonyldialdehyde content. Between the 1st and 7th days, we recorded an increase of about 20% in flap temperature in groups 1, 2 and 3, whereas no significant variation was observed in group 4. On the 7th day, videocapillaroscopic findings showed an increase in the mean vascularization index in group 4. Our findings suggest that recombinant human erythropoietin administration can improve the wound healing process, in both early and late stages of injury, by reducing inflammatory response, increasing the density of capillaries in ischaemic flaps and allowing earlier repair of a damaged area.", "journal": "Acta dermato-venereologica", "date": "2003-02-11", "authors": ["MicheleBuemi", "MarioVaccaro", "AlessioSturiale", "Maria RosariaGaleano", "CarloSansotta", "VittorioCavallari", "FulvioFloccari", "DomenicoD'Amico", "ValerioTorre", "GioacchinoCalapai", "NicolaFrisina", "FabrizioGuarneri", "GiuseppeVermiglio"], "doi": "10.1080/000155502762064520"}
{"title": "Heparinase enhances collateral vessel development in the ischemic limb.", "abstract": "Several angiogenic factors are bound to heparin and stored in the extracellular matrix of diverse tissues; thus, the controlled release of these factors can provide a novel approach of angiogenic stimulation to ischemic tissues. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that heparinase, when administered in vivo, might enhance collateral vessel development in the ischemic limb by the controlled release of angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Eleven male New Zealand White rabbits underwent ligation and excision of the common and superficial femoral arteries in the left hindlimb. In the heparinase group (n = 6), 9.7 IU of heparinase (in 3 ml saline) was injected intramuscularly to the left thigh daily for 10 days, beginning 11 days after surgery. In the control group (n = 5), inactivated heparinase (also in 3 ml saline) was administered following the same experimental protocol. Calf systolic pressure was measured in both hindlimbs and was expressed as a ratio of left to right (L/R ratio) before injections (on day 10) and after injections (on days 20, 30, and 40). Vascularization was quantified by comparing the number of vessels along a line drawn across the mid-thigh on angiograms taken 4 seconds after contrast injection at day 40 when the study was terminated. The intramuscular injection of heparinase improves perfusion to the ischemic limb through the process of enhanced collateral vessel development. The angiogenic effect of heparinase on the ischemic tissue may result from release of endogenous angiogenic factors, such as bFGF.", "journal": "International surgery", "date": "2003-02-11", "authors": ["Lee L QPu", "Kevin RHolme", "James FSymes"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Changes in the distribution of sugar receptors in blood vessels and cell elements of rat brain caused by photochemically induced focal ischaemia.", "abstract": "The lectin technique was applied to the histochemical studies of glycoconjugates comprising membranes of capillary endothelial cells and other cellular elements of the CNS. In the studies we used the following lectins: Concanavalin A (Con A), Bandeirea simplicifolia agglutinin (BS-I), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA-120), Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). We noticed changes in the localisation of the glycoconjugates, which are the result of cerebral ischaemia caused by focal irradiation of the left hemisphere of the brain after the previous intravenous injection of control animals with Rose bengal. The described changes seem to be the result of disturbances of the functioning of the blood-brain barrier, which was previously described (Gadamski et al. 2001). In this study, however, we have shown morphological and histochemical changes, which lead to the translocation of examined glycoconjugates within the appearing necrosis areas, around them and in the regions significantly distant from them. This refers to neurones, glial cells and endothelia of brain vessels. So we have described a clear diminution of Con A and HPA-positive receptors from neocortical and hippocampal neurones. The Con A receptors appeared however in morphologically changed, contracted capillaries and HPA receptors in macrophages and reactive cells of necrosis areas. In these areas the BSI-I receptors also appeared and additionally labelled astrocytes in the hippocampus and oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum. The endothelial glycoconjugates visualised by RCA-120 and WGA also showed weakening of the histochemical reaction in the CNS vascular network and appeared in phagocytes and reactive astrocytes. The focal brain ischaemia induced this way, leading to disturbances in localisation and accumulation of the specific sugar receptors revealed by the lectin technique, determines the histochemical expression of the postischaemic changes in CNS.", "journal": "Folia neuropathologica", "date": "2003-02-08", "authors": ["GrazynaSzuma\u0144iska", "RomanGadamski", "Ilja VVictorow", "Igor VBarskow", "RenataWojda", "JolantaKrzywicka"], "doi": null}

Observations in a rat endochondral ossification model were confirmed by studies of human cartilage biopsies from foetuses with osteogenesis imperfecta.

VEGF is a major angiogenic factor involved in physiological as well as pathological angiogenesis. The ability of VEGF to promote angiogenesis in animal and clinical studies has been studied extensively. However, it is becoming clear that VEGF alone may not be sufficient to effectively complete the angiogenesis process. The use of more than one growth factor may be more pertinent in creating a sustainable angiogenic effect with clinically significant outcome. The challenge is to find complementary partners in angiogenesis to better affect the outcome of the process. To this end, we have been studying the effects of other angiogenic factors such as angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in a chronic ischemic porcine model. Single intramyocardial introduction of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Ang-1 into the left ventricle free wall has been found to enhance angiogenesis by augmenting the formation of new capillaries that manifested in improved total blood flow in the myocardium.

The conjunctival pedicle from the upper eyelid is divided after vascularization of the reconstructed lower eyelid is judged to be adequate (traditionally, at least 3 weeks postoperatively). This study reviews the outcomes of patients in whom the conjunctival flap prematurely dehisced.\nEight patients were identified during a 15-year interval. The posterior lamellar defects ranged in size from 13 to 30 mm horizontally and 5 to 8 mm vertically. The average age at the time of eyelid reconstruction was 72 years (range, 60-84 years). Flap dehiscence, resulting in each case from accidental trauma, occurred between 1 and 11 days postoperatively. Surgical repair of the dehiscence was unsuccessfully attempted in one case; otherwise, the eyelids were permitted to heal spontaneously with the application of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment as the sole therapy.\nAlthough the result was satisfactory in each case, one patient, who had dry eyes from Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, required secondary surgery to treat mild lagophthalmos and lower eyelid retraction. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 122 months (median, 6.5 months).\nThe ultimate functional and aesthetic outcomes after premature, traumatic dehiscence of a Hughes flap were surprisingly good, suggesting that elective division of the conjunctival pedicle in routine cases can be performed relatively soon after the primary reconstructive procedure.", "journal": "Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society", "date": "2003-01-28", "authors": ["George BBartley", "Marlene MMessenger"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Morphological analyses of interleukin-8 effects on rat ovarian follicles at ovulation and luteinization in vivo.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to elucidate functions of the interleukin (IL)-8 at ovulation and luteinization in vivo. To compare the morphological differences between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and IL-8 stimulation, scanning electron microscopy was employed to study rat ovarian vascular corrosion casts. Follicular growth and increased capillary vessel densities around the follicles were seen in vascular corrosion casts after IL-8 injection, similar to the result of hCG administration. This result indicated that exogenous IL-8 could play a role in the neovascularization during follicular development as an angiogenetic factor. Many fenestrations were observed in the vascular endothelium by hCG administration. In contrast, no fenestrations were observed with IL-8 injection, indicating that IL-8 may not be sufficient to increase the vascular permeability directly. Although germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) occurred at rates of 82% after the hCG injection, only 20% GVBD was observed after the IL-8 injection. The present study indicated that IL-8 might have important effects on rat follicles at ovulation and luteinization via vascularization in a similar manner to hCG. However, IL-8 was not effective on vascular permeability and oocyte maturation, which were different from hCG. Thus, we can conclude that IL-8 can participate in follicular development in part and may play important roles in ovulation and luteinization as one of some mediators induced by endogenous luteinizing hormone.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2003-01-25", "authors": ["JunkoGoto", "NobuhikoSuganuma", "KayokoTakata", "KimiyaKitamura", "ToshihikoAsahina", "HiroshiKobayashi", "YoshinoriMuranaka", "MadokaFuruhashi", "NaohiroKanayama"], "doi": "10.1006/cyto.2002.1987"}

Differently stained plastic resins were injected into the blood vessels and lymphatics of the submandibular lymph node and visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The specimens were corroded to study the three-dimensional cast structures by scanning electron microscopy. Alkali digestion was also used to prepare the reticular fiber network in the lymph node for scanning electron microscopic examination. At the hilus of the node, two to three arteries gave off arterioles running in medullary cords towards the cortex. The medullary cords, the periphery of the deep cortex, and the perifollicular zones had dense capillary networks. In contrast, the center of the follicle and the center of the deep cortex were less highly vascularized. High-endothelial venules were restricted to the perifollicular zone and the periphery of the deep cortex. At the cortico-medullary boundary, they abruptly transformed into medullary venules with a normal endothelium. The marginal sinus of the lymph node was crossed by thick reticular fibers that arose from the inner sheets of the capsule. The lymph pathway went through the marginal sinus, into the trabecular sinus, to the cortical perifollicular sinus, the dense lymphatic sinus around the deep cortex, and finally into the medullary sinus.

{"title": "Sphingosine kinase, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and apoptosis.", "abstract": "The sphingolipid metabolites ceramide (Cer), sphingosine (Sph), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and cell death. Cer and Sph usually inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis, while the further metabolite S1P stimulates growth and suppresses apoptosis. Because these metabolites are interconvertible, it has been proposed that it is not the absolute amounts of these metabolites but rather their relative levels that determines cell fate. The relevance of this \"sphingolipid rheostat\" and its role in regulating cell fate has been borne out by work in many labs using many different cell types and experimental manipulations. A central finding of these studies is that Sph kinase (SphK), the enzyme that phosphorylates Sph to form S1P, is a critical regulator of the sphingolipid rheostat, as it not only produces the pro-growth, anti-apoptotic messenger S1P, but also decreases levels of pro-apoptotic Cer and Sph. Given the role of the sphingolipid rheostat in regulating growth and apoptosis, it is not surprising that sphingolipid metabolism is often found to be disregulated in cancer, a disease characterized by enhanced cell growth, diminished cell death, or both. Anticancer therapeutics targeting SphK are potentially clinically relevant. Indeed, inhibition of SphK has been shown to suppress gastric tumor growth [Cancer Res. 51 (1991) 1613] and conversely, overexpression of SphK increases tumorigenicity [Curr. Biol. 10 (2000) 1527]. Moreover, S1P has also been shown to regulate angiogenesis, or new blood vessel formation [Cell 99 (1999) 301], which is critical for tumor progression. Furthermore, there is intriguing new evidence that S1P can act in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion [Science 291 (2001) 1800] to regulate blood vessel formation [J. Clin. Invest. 106 (2000) 951]. Thus, SphK may not only protect tumors from apoptosis, it may also increase their vascularization, further enhancing growth. The cytoprotective effects of SphK/S1P may also be important for clinical benefit, as S1P has been shown to protect oocytes from radiation-induced cell death in vivo [Nat. Med. 6 (2000) 1109]. Here we review the growing literature on the regulation of SphK and the role of SphK and its product, S1P, in apoptosis.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2003-01-18", "authors": ["MichaelMaceyka", "Shawn GPayne", "SheldonMilstien", "SarahSpiegel"], "doi": "10.1016/s1388-1981(02)00341-4"}

These tissues maintain the life of adrenalectomized animals, show normal cell proliferation rates, and maintain a constant tissue size. These experiments were performed by co-transfection of an hTERT-encoding plasmid with an SV40 T antigen-encoding plasmid, but in tissues formed from clones derived in this way SV40 T Ag was not expressed. However, when tissues were formed from nonclonal heterogeneous populations of transfected cells, nodules of SV40 TAg-expressing cells arose that showed a high proliferation rate. These structures resembled nodules formed from transplanted bovine adrenocortical cells in which SV40 TAg was introduced by retroviral transduction rather than transfection. The reasons for these phenomena are discussed; in a nonclonal mixed population of cells, some may have much higher levels of SV40 TAg, which perturbs the normal histology and behavior of tissues formed from hTERT-immortalized adrenocortical cells.", "journal": "Endocrine research", "date": "2003-01-18", "authors": ["Peter JHornsby", "LianqingYang", "MichaelThomas"], "doi": "10.1081/erc-120017072"}

The purpose of the present study was to define whether amifostine protects the vascular network from the effects of X-rays. We used the in vivo system of chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) as a model of angiogenesis. Amifostine reversed the early X-rays- induced decrease in the number of CAM blood vessels and reversed the early radiation-induced apoptosis of CAM cells. It also inhibited the increase in tyrosine nitration of actin and a-tubulin, which was observed 6 hours after CAM irradiation, when there was a significant decrease in non-protein SH groups. Furthermore, C6 rat glioma cells were inoculated on CAM and tumor growth, as well as tumor-induced angiogenesis, was estimated on haematoxylin-eosin-stained paraffin sections. Amifostine inhibited the post irradiation increase of C6 tumor-induced angiogenesis.

Plain radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are classified as structural imaging modalities, whereas bone scintigraphy is a functional method. In many cases, radionuclide imaging techniques are the only means by which early physiologic changes that are a direct result of biochemical alteration may be assessed, before significant bone mineral changes can be detected by other means. Since many oral diseases may cause metabolic changes in the oromaxillofacial complex, it would be of great value to use bone scintigraphy to evaluate more completely some conditions involving the bones in the region to formulate more appropriate treatment plans.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of additional phytohormone signals in the vascularization required for rapid tumor proliferation. In stem tumors of Ricinus communis L., free auxin and zeatin riboside concentrations increased within 2 weeks to 15-fold the concentrations in control stem tissue. Auxin and cytokinin immunolocalization revealed the highest concentrations within and around tumor vascular bundles with concentration gradients. The time-course of changes in free auxin concentration in roots was inversely correlated with that in the tumors. The high ethylene emission induced by increased auxin- and cytokinin correlated with a 36-fold accumulation of abscisic acid in tumors. Ethylene emitted from tumors and exogenously applied ethylene caused an increase in abscisic acid concentrations also in the host leaves, with a diminution in leaf water vapor conductance. Jasmonic acid concentration reached a maximum already within the first week of bacterial infection. A wound effect could be excluded. The results demonstrate the concerted interaction of a cascade of transiently induced, non-T-DNA-encoded phytohormones jasmonic acid, ethylene and abscisic acid with T-DNA-encoded auxin and zeatin riboside plus trans-zeatin, all of which are required for successful plant tumor vascularization and development together with inhibition of host plant growth.", "journal": "Planta", "date": "2003-01-10", "authors": ["DmitryVeselov", "MarkusLanghans", "WolframHartung", "RoniAloni", "IvoFeussner", "ClaudiaG\u00f6tz", "SvetlanaVeselova", "StefanSchlomski", "ChristophDickler", "KnutB\u00e4chmann", "Cornelia IUllrich"], "doi": "10.1007/s00425-002-0883-5"}

The other type was a tapering tip of the endothelial tube covered with pericytic processes. The presence of long processes of pericytes extending beyond the tip of the endothelial tube and connecting to the adjacent vessel wall indicates that this type was produced by endothelial tube regression.

{"title": "Deregulated activation of matriptase in breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Matriptase is an epithelial-derived, cell surface serine protease. This protease activates hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), two proteins thought to be involved in the growth and motility of cancer cells, particularly carcinomas, and in the vascularization of tumors. Thus, matriptase may play an important role in the progression of carcinomas, such as breast cancer. We examined the regulation of activation of matriptase in human breast cancer cells, in comparison to non-transformed mammary epithelial cells 184A1N4 and MCF-10A. Results clearly indicated that unlike non-transformed mammary epithelial cells, breast cancer cells do not respond to the known activators of matriptase, serum and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Similar levels of activated matriptase were detected in breast cancer cells, grown in the presence or absence of S1P. However, up to five-fold higher levels of activated matriptase were detected in the conditioned media from the cancer cells grown in the absence of serum and S1P, when compared to non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. S1P also induces formation of cortical actin structures in non-transformed cells, but not in breast cancer cells. These results show that in non-transformed cells, S1P induces a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and stimulates proteolytic activity on cell surfaces. In contrast, S1P treatment of breast cancer cells does not activate matriptase, and instead these cells constitutively activate the protease. In addition, breast cancer cells respond differently to S1P in terms of the regulation of actin cytoskeletal structures. Matriptase and its cognate inhibitor, HGF activator inhibitor 1 (HAI-1) colocalize on the cell periphery of breast cancer cells and form stable complexes in the extracellular milieu, suggesting that the inhibitor serves to prevent undesired proteolysis in these cells.

The lateral genicervical skin was supplied basically by the branches of the facial, superficial temporal and occipital arteries, but also by the terminal branches of the superior thyroid artery. The branches diverging from these arteries became superficial and formed a subcutaneous arterial network. The arterioles from the network went to the corium layer and formed a subdermal arterial network whose arterioles anastomosed with each other in a honeycomb-like structure. The vascular distribution presented certain directivity on different areas. The blood supply of the pedicle originated from the subdermal vascular network formed by the perforator branches of these arteries. The arterioles from the facial and superficial temporal arteries anastomosed in the lateral genicervical region. From the anatomic study, we think that the viability of the facial SVNF depends basically on the subdermal vascular network formed by the perforator branches of the pedicle, and that the anastomoses between the facial and superficial temporal arteries provide a solid anatomic basis to the lateral genicervical flap. The clinical data also indicated that this flap is a useful alternative for facial, especially superficial temporal, defects. But the directivity must be taken into account in its clinical application.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2002-12-24", "authors": ["S-HXiong", "X-DCheng", "D-CXu", "NLi", "LYan", "T-LZhao", "LYu", "HLiao", "FSuwa", "ATakemura", "IToda", "HIke", "Y-RFang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-002-0061-2"}
{"title": "IL-10/IL-10 receptor signaling regulates TIMP-1 expression in primary human prostate tumor lines.", "abstract": "An IL-10 responsive signal protein, termed IL-10E1, was cloned from human prostate cancer PC-3 ML cells based on its binding affinity for a novel enhancer element (i.e., HTE-1: 5'-CACGATGACTCATCACTGTTGAAAGACA-3') of the Tissue Inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and enzyme linked immuno-sandwich assays (ELISAs) showed that IL-10 stimulated the rapid translocation of IL-10E1 to the nucleus and the activation of TIMP-1 expression in 4 different androgen dependent primary prostate tumor lines generated in our laboratory (i.e. HPCA-5a, 5b, 5c and 5d lines). IL-10 signaling was blocked by a variety of agents, including IL-10 receptor antibodies, alpha-toxin, and Genistein. The inhibition of IL-10 signaling and IL-10E1 expression correlated directly with a significant decrease in TIMP-1 expression by the HPCA-5a, 5b, 5c and 5d cell lines. Following permanent transfection of HPCA-5a and 5c cells with the IL-10 gene the growth of tumor xenografts in SCID CB17 mice was severely retarded, yielding tiny, poorly vascularized tumors by approximately 90 days post-inoculation s.c. ELISAs showed that these tumors expressed elevated levels of IL-10, IL-10E1 and TIMP-1 compared with tumors from non-transfected or Mock transfected cell lines. We conclude that the IL-10/IL-10 receptor axis (and IL-10E1 signaling) regulation of TIMP-1 expression plays a key role in inhibiting tumor growth, perhaps by blocking tumor vascularization.", "journal": "Cancer biology & therapy", "date": "2002-12-24", "authors": ["MinWang", "YoujiHu", "IschiroShima", "Mark EStearns"], "doi": "10.4161/cbt.1.5.222"}
{"title": "The human melanoma associated protein melanotransferrin promotes endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "Melanotransferrin is a member of the transferrin family, which is comprised of serum transferrin, lactoferrin and ovotransferrin, and is highly expressed on melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes. Since melanoma is an highly vascularized tumour that expresses melanotransferrin at high levels, we tested purified recombinant melanotransferrin for its capability to induce angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the vascular density demonstrated that melanotransferrin exerts an angiogenic response quantitatively similar to that elicited by fibroblast growth factor-2. Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor-2 was observed in newly formed vessels, suggesting that the angiogenic activity of melanotransferrin may depend on activation of endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, when antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor were included in the assay, the angiogenic response was inhibited by 50%. In a Boyden chamber assay purified recombinant melanotransferrin induced chemotactic migration of vascular cells, which was decreased in the the presence of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies suggesting an involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor present in endothelial cells also in this assay. However, melanotransferrin was found not to directly bind to integrin alphavbeta3 or the vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor-2 as assessed in a BlAcore assay. A possible correlation between vascularization occurring during melanoma progression and the expression of melanotransferrin and vascular endothelial growth factor was established by immunolocalization of the two factors in sections of melanoma at different clinical steps of melanoma progression. These latter data strongly imply that melanotransferrin may participate in the vascularization of solid tumours and that inhibition of melanotransferrin could form the basis for intervention in tumours which use this pathway.", "journal": "European journal of cell biology", "date": "2002-12-24", "authors": ["RobertaSala", "Wilfred AJefferies", "BrandieWalker", "JosephYang", "JacquelineTiong", "S K AlexLaw", "Mariella FCarlevaro", "EddyDi Marco", "AngeloVacca", "RanieriCancedda", "Fiorella DescalziCancedda", "DomenicoRibatti"], "doi": "10.1078/0171-9335-00280"}

In the cases here described we were able to demonstrate a fragment displacement in the area of Lister's tubercle suspected by the native X-ray and further evaluated by a CT scan.

{"title": "Tumor-stroma interactions directing phenotype and progression of epithelial skin tumor cells.", "abstract": "Tumor-stroma interactions play a significant role in tumor development and progression. Alterations in the stromal microenvironment, including enhanced vasculature (angiogenesis), modified extracellular matrix composition, inflammatory cells, and dys-balanced protease activity, are essential regulatory factors of tumor growth and invasion. Differential modulation of stromal characteristics is induced by epithelial skin tumor cells depending on their transformation stage when grown as surface transplants in vivo. Tumor cells can regulate the development of a \"tumor-stroma\" via the aberrant expression of growth factors or induction of growth factor receptors in the stromal compartment. In this context, secretion of the hematopoietic growth factors G-CSF and GM-CSF, constituitively expressed in enhanced malignant tumors, may be good candidates for induction of a tumor stroma through their effect on inflammatory cells. Upon its induction, the tumor stroma will reciprocally influence the differentiation status of tumor cells resulting in a normalization of benign tumor epithelia and the maintenance of a malignant phenotype, respectively. In the HaCaT model for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, stromal activation and angiogenesis are transient in pre-malignant transplants, however they remain persistent in malignant transplants where progressive angiogenesis is closely correlated with tumor invasion. While continued expression of VEGF and PDGF are associated with benign tumor phenotypes, activation of VEGFR-2 is a hallmark of malignant tumors and accompanies ongoing angiogenesis and tumor invasion. As a consequence the inhibition of ongoing angiogenesis by blocking VEGFR-2 signalling resulted in dramatically impaired malignant tumor expansion and invasion. Comparably, tumor vascularization and invasion was blocked by disturbing the balance of matrix protease activity caused by a lack of PAI-1 in the stromal cells of the knockout mouse hosts. A similar inhibition of tumor vascularization was caused by TSP-1 over-expression in skin carcinoma cells, which also blocked tumor invasion and expansion. On the other hand, when granulation tissue and angiogenesis were only transiently activated as a result of stable transfection of PDGF into non-tumorigenic HaCaT cells, the target cells formed benign, but not malignant, tumors. Collectively, these data show that tumor vascularization, providing intimate association of blood vessels with tumor cells, is a prerequisite for tumor invasion. A potential mechanism for this interrelationship may be the differential regulation of MMP-expression in tumors of different grades of malignancy. In vitro MMP expression did not discriminate between benign and malignant tumor cells unless they were co-cultured with stromal fibroblasts. However, in vivo regulation of MMP expression was clearly dependent on tumor phenotype. While MMP-1 and MMP-13 were down-regulated in benign transplants, they were persistently up-regulated in malignant ones. A tight balance between proteases and their inhibitors is crucial for both the formation and infiltration of blood vessels and for tumor cell invasion, thus again emphasizing the importance of the stromal compartment for the development and progression of carcinomas.", "journal": "Differentiation; research in biological diversity", "date": "2002-12-21", "authors": ["Margareta MMueller", "Norbert EFusenig"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1432-0436.2002.700903.x"}

{"title": "Heat shock preconditioning impairs revascularization of freely transplanted pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "Revascularization of freely transplanted pancreatic islets is essential for appropriate graft function and survival. During the first days after transplantation, however, islet transplants are avascular, and successful engraftment is believed to be markedly hampered by hypoxia-induced tissue injury. Because heat shock has been shown to induce cell resistance against hypoxia, it seems reasonable to stress pancreatic islets by heat before transplantation. In contrast, hypoxia is a major stimulus for angiogenesis, and thus heat shock preconditioning-induced resistance against hypoxia may decrease stimulation of angiogenesis. The authors therefore studied in vivo whether heat shock preconditioning of isolated islets affects angiogenesis and revascularization after free transplantation.\nAfter collagenase isolation, heat shock-preconditioned islets (42 degrees C for 30 min) were transplanted syngeneically into nontreated skinfold chambers of Syrian hamsters. In a second group of animals, nontreated islets were transplanted into heat shock-preconditioned chambers. Nontreated islets transplanted into nontreated chambers served as controls. Islet angiogenesis and revascularization were quantitatively analyzed during 14 days after transplantation using intravital fluorescence microscopy. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.\nImmunohistochemistry revealed expression of HSP32 (heme oxygenase [HO]-1), HSP72, and also intracellular insulin in isolated and transplanted pancreatic islets. Western blot analysis showed enhanced HSP32 but slightly decreased HSP72 expression in heat shock-preconditioned islets when compared with controls. Intravital microscopy revealed appropriate vascularization of control islets within 14 days after transplantation. Heat shock preconditioning of the host tissue (i.e., the skinfold chambers) did not affect islet vascularization when compared with controls. In contrast, heat shock preconditioning of the isolated islets resulted in a significantly (P < 0.05) impaired take rate, a reduced (P < 0.05) size of the newly formed microvascular network, and thus a smaller area (P < 0.05) of microvascularly perfused endocrine tissue.\nThese data suggest that heat shock preconditioning of isolated pancreatic islets before transplantation impairs the process of graft angiogenesis and revascularization. Therefore, transient exposure of isolated islets to heat may not be considered a promising tool to improve the outcome of islet transplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2002-12-20", "authors": ["ReneSchramm", "ClaudiaScheuer", "Jun-ichiroYamauchi", "BrigitteVollmar", "Michael DMenger"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200212150-00011"}

Twenty-five patients (27.4%) showed an intra-abdominal testis (IAT): 24 underwent a laparoscopy-assisted orchidopexy (LAO) without sectioning of the spermatic vessels, and one, whose inner spermatic vessels were not adequately long for LAO without tension, underwent a two-step Fowler-Stephens (FS) procedure. The technique consists of dissection and mobilization of the inner spermatic vessels and the vas deferens from the posterior peritoneum, sectioning of the gubernaculum attachments, and bringing down of the testis into the scrotum through the internal inguinal ring, if open, or through a neo-inguinal ring created medial to the epigastric vessels.\nSurgery lasted between 40 and 80 minutes (median 60 minutes). All the testes were brought down into the scrotum. There was only 1 (4%) intraoperative complication, which occurred in the second patient operated on with this procedure.

{"title": "Role of growth factors in coronary morphogenesis.", "abstract": "This communication briefly reviews the role of angiogenic growth factors in myocardial vessel formation during development. The earliest signs of vascularization are the migration and differentiation of angioblasts from the epicardium and subepicardium into the myocardium. A regulator of this process is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is probably triggered by hypoxia. The subsequent formation of vascular tubes is regulated by multiple growth factors: VEGF family members, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and angiopoietins and their receptors. Our studies on explanted quail hearts reveal that these growth factors are interdependent. We also have shown that a harmonic interplay of growth factors characterizes early postnatal development in rats. Neutralizing antibodies to either basic FGF (bFGF) or VEGF inhibit capillary formation, whereas arteriolar growth is markedly inhibited by bFGF, but not VEGF, neutralizing antibodies. Arteriolar diameter is also increased when anti-bFGF and anti-VEGF are administered in combination. Thus, the hierarchical development of the arteriolar vasculature depends on both of these growth factors; however, the establishment of arterioles, as reflected by length density, is dependent on bFGF but not on VEG. Finally, stretch of cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells serves as a stimulus for increases in growth factor and receptor proteins. We have shown that cyclic stretch of either cell type increases VEGF, and that endothelial cells respond to stretch by up-regulation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and Tie-2 receptor. These results indicate that both mechanical and metabolic factors are primary stimuli for coronary angiogenesis.", "journal": "Texas Heart Institute journal", "date": "2002-12-18", "authors": ["Robert JTomanek", "WeiZheng"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Cellular precursors of the coronary arteries.", "abstract": "Coronary vessels develop from a primary vascular network that differentiates in the subepicardium through a process of vasculogenesis, that is, self-assembly of mesenchymal vascular progenitors. Further growth of the subepicardial vascular plexus through a complex process of angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and arterialization of specific branches gives rise to the definitive coronary system. This report is intended to summarize current knowledge on the origin of the coronary vascular progenitors and to provide new insights suggested by recent findings. It has been established that the mesenchymal precursors of the vascular smooth muscle cells and the adventitial fibroblasts originate from an epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of the epicardial mesothelium. We report herein experimental evidence that the precursors of the coronary endothelium are also epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs). The evidence shown includes co-localization of mesothelial and endothelial molecular markers as well as cell lineage studies performed through direct labeling of the epicardial cells. If this proposal is confirmed, the early EPDCs might be found to have a competence similar to that shown by the recently discovered bipotential vascular progenitor cells, which are able to differentiate into endothelium or smooth muscle depending on their exposure to VEGF or PDGF-BB. It is conceivable that the earliest EPDCs differentiate into endothelial cells in response to myocardially secreted VEGF, while subsequent EPDCs, recruited by the nascent capillaries via PDGFRbeta signaling, differentiate into percytes and smooth muscle cells.", "journal": "Texas Heart Institute journal", "date": "2002-12-18", "authors": ["Ram\u00f3nMu\u00f1oz-Ch\u00e1puli", "MauricioGonz\u00e1lez-Iriarte", "RitaCarmona", "GerardoAtencia", "DavidMac\u00edas", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00edaP\u00e9rez-Pomares"], "doi": null}

The healing and functioning of vascularized bone autografts depend mainly on the patency of the microcirculation, and the activation of ET-A receptors may be an important component of the tissue response that occurs during ischemia-reoxygenation injuries.\nWistar rats were subjected to 1 hour of hindlimb ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion. The periosteal microcirculation was visualized by intravital fluorescence microscopy. The leukocyte rolling and adherence in the postcapillary venules and the functional capillary density of the periosteum were determined. Two separate groups were treated with the selective ET-A receptor antagonist BQ 610 or the novel ET-A receptor antagonist ETR-p1/fl peptide at the onset of reperfusion.\nReperfusion was accompanied by a significant decrease in functional capillary density and by an increase in the primary and secondary leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. ET-A receptor inhibition reduced the leukocyte rolling and firm adherence and attenuated the decrease in functional capillary density in both treated groups.\nET-1 plays a major role in microvascular dysfunction in the periosteum during reperfusion.

The following case illustrates the effects of surgery for a meningioma of the foramen magnum on arterial hypertension.\nA 54-year-old woman suffered from arterial hypertension for at least 7 months, for which she required a combined medical treatment regime. She suffered for 6 months from dizziness and tinnitus, more in the left ear than in the right. Neurologic examination revealed a horizontal fixation nystagmus and a mild left-sided hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic angiography showed a contrast-enhancing tumor on the left side of the foramen magnum compressing the medulla oblongata close to the vertebral artery and vascularized by branches of the left PICA. Complete surgical extirpation was performed using a medial craniocervical approach. The tinnitus and dizziness were gone and hearing improved. Postoperatively, the arterial hypertension showed a long-lasting improvement (observation period 8 months) with only minimal medical treatment.\nBased on our case, we conclude that tumors in close proximity to the ventrolateral medulla oblongata may induce neurogenic hypertension, similar to neurovascular compression.", "journal": "Surgical neurology", "date": "2002-12-14", "authors": ["Bertold AndreasW\u00f6rner", "TamimRahim", "ManfredLange", "UlrichFink", "ReinhardOeckler"], "doi": "10.1016/s0090-3019(02)00840-6"}

Genetic engineering of vascularized organs for endothelial cell (EC) expression of FasL could protect the endothelium and underlying tissues from infiltrating Fas+ leukocytes. Nevertheless, the endogenous expression of FasL by ECs of different species and the potential deleterious effects of enforced FasL expression by ECs are largely unknown. In human ECs, levels of FLICE/caspase 8-inhibitory protein (FLIP) have been shown to control apoptosis mediated by Fas.\nCell surface expression of FasL in rat, mouse, human, and pig ECs was obtained using recombinant adenoviruses or transient plasmid transfection assays. FasL expression was evaluated by FACS analysis and cytotoxicity assays. Apoptosis was evaluated using annexin V, TUNEL, and cytotoxicity assays. FLIP levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis and overexpression was obtained by transient transfection.\nAnalysis of ECs from different species showed that FasL was predominantly present in the cytoplasm, and depending on the species, little or no cell surface expression was detected. Enforced cell surface expression of FasL on rat or mouse ECs, either in culture or within the vessel wall resulted in massive apoptosis. In contrast, porcine or human ECs were completely resistant to apoptosis mediated by Fas-FasL interaction. Markedly reduced FLIP levels were observed in rat and mouse ECs compared to human and porcine ECs. Overexpression of FLIP in rat ECs conferred protection against cell surface expression of FasL.\nThe consequences of FasL overexpression depend on the subcellular compartment and species in which FasL enforced expression is targeted and this is at least partially related to FLIP levels.", "journal": "Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)", "date": "2002-12-13", "authors": ["DelphineBouchet", "LaurentTesson", "S\u00e9verineM\u00e9noret", "BeatriceCharreau", "PatrickMathieu", "HideoYagita", "GhislaineDuisit", "IgnacioAnegon"], "doi": null}

Many approaches and techniques for the removal of cement mantles are published. We prefer the intrafemoral approach with an distal vascularized femoral window.\nWe want to describe our surgical technique and report the short term results of 45 revision arthroplasties of the hip using the uncemented modular titanium MRP stem.

We hypothesized that a hypovascular area is present in the capsule. The purpose of the present study was to describe the vascular anatomy of the human glenohumeral capsule and ligaments and its relevance to surgical treatment of the shoulder.\nIn twenty-four fresh adult cadaveric shoulders, the axillary artery proximal to the thoracoacromial branch and the suprascapular artery were injected with India ink. The specimens were sectioned and then cleared with a modified Spalteholz technique.\nThe glenohumeral capsule demonstrates consistent arterial contributions from the anterior circumflex, posterior circumflex, circumflex scapular, and suprascapular arteries. The arterial supply is centripetal in nature. The contributing vessels enter the capsule both laterally and medially and arborize toward the middle of the capsule. The rotator cuff provides additional blood supply to the capsule through perforating vessels. The dominant capsular vessels run horizontally and form intracapsular anastomoses via vertical branches. The anterior and posterior bands of the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex are vascularized by adjacent parallel vessels. In five of twelve specimens, a hypovascular zone was located near the humeral insertion of the anterior aspect of the capsule. In these five specimens, there was an associated hypovascular zone in the underlying capsule.\nThe glenohumeral capsule is a well-vascularized structure with direct predictable contributions from four named arteries.

We then studied the role of FrzA in several distinct angiogenic models. FrzA induced angiogenesis in a chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Moreover, gene transfer of AdFrzA in grafted mesenchymal and glioma cells increased vessel density and tumor growth. FrzA induced formation of vessels, which were enlarged, longer, and appeared to be more mature compared with vessels formed under control treatments. In vitro, FrzA increased migration and tube formation of endothelial cells and seemed to protect them from apoptosis. FrzA-angiogenic effect in vitro was independent of vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, or angiopiotin-1 induction and Akt activation. In contrast, FrzA decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation.\nThese results showed that FrzA has proangiogenic effects and suggest that Wnt signaling may be involved in normal differentiation as well as in the pathological development of vasculature.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2002-12-11", "authors": ["PascaleDufourcq", "ThierryCouffinhal", "J\u00e9romeEzan", "LaurentBarandon", "CatherineMoreau", "Dani\u00e8leDaret", "C\u00e9cileDupl\u00e0a"], "doi": "10.1161/01.cir.0000039342.85015.5c"}

It can thus be used effectively to identify the larger nodules, while it is unable to provide any indication as to their histological type. Ultrasound vascular thyroid study is a non-invasive and low-cost method and is very reliable in the differential diagnosis of cold thyroid nodules.

Localized hepatocellular glycogenosis was observed surrounding the islets in a primate with functioning islets 7 months post transplant. Liver sections from a primate that rejected islets transplanted 2 months prior displayed only islet remnants with prominent local lymphohistiocytic inflammation and an occasional capillary.

However, it remains unclear how MCs regulate the morphogenic activity of ECs to form an organized vascular architecture, comprising distinct artery, vein, and capillary, from a simple mesh-like network. A clear elucidation of this question requires an experimental model system in which ECs are separated from MCs and yet form vascular structures. Here we report that injection of an antagonistic mAb against PDGFR-beta into murine neonates provides such an experimental system in the retina by completely blocking MC recruitment to developing vessels. While a vascular network was formed even in the absence of MCs, it was poorly remodeled and leaky. Using this vascular system ideal for direct assessment of the activities of MC-derived molecules, we show that addition of recombinant modified angiopoietin-1 restored a hierarchical vasculature, and also rescued retinal edema and hemorrhage in the complete absence of MCs.

{"title": "Distribution, markers, and functions of retinal microglia.", "abstract": "Retinal microglia originate from hemopoietic cells and invade the retina from the retinal margin and the optic disc, most likely via the blood vessels of the ciliary body and iris, and the retinal vasculature, respectively. The microglial precursors that appear in the retina prior to vascularization are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and II-positive and express the CD45 marker, but lack specific macrophage markers. They differentiate into ramified parenchymal microglia in the adult retina. A second category of microglial precursors, which do express specific macrophage markers, migrate into the retina along with vascular precursors. They appear around blood vessels in the adult retina and are similar to macrophages or cells of the mononuclear phagocyte series (MPS). Microglia are distributed in the outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and nerve fiber layer (NFL) of the primate retina. The pattern of microglial distribution in the avascular retina of the quail indicates that blood vessels are not responsible for the final location of microglia in the retina. In the human retina, microglia express MHC class I, MHC class II, CD45, CD68, and S22 markers. In the rat and mouse retina, OX41, OX42, OX3, OX6, OX18, ED1, Mac-1, F4/80, 5D4 anti-keratan sulfate, and lectins are used to recognize microglia. Microglial cells play an important role in host defense against invading microorganisms, immunoregulation, and tissue repair. During neurodegeneration, activated microglial cells participate in the phagocytosis of debris and facilitate regenerative processes.

Pedicled local flaps from the forearm are one reconstructive option, but its use is limited by relatively high donor-site problems, including a disagreeable forearm scar and potential division of superficial forearm nerves. We describe a pedicled local flap option--the distally based radial artery/flexor carpi radialis flap, which potentially decreases forearm donor-site morbidity while still providing for coverage of small hand soft tissue defects. Six cadaver forearm dissections were performed to confirm that the vascular supply to the middle and distal portion of the flexor carpi radialis comes off the radial artery. Four clinical cases are presented in which the flexor carpi radialis muscle based on the distal radial artery was used to cover complex wounds of the dorsum of the hand. We believe the lack of damage to the superficial sensory forearm nerves and the ease of flexor carpi radialis muscle flap elevation make this a versatile flap for small, complex, soft tissue defects of the hand.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2002-11-29", "authors": ["Alexandrina SSaulis", "Samir SSukkar", "Gregory ADumanian"], "doi": "10.1053/jhsu.2002.35869"}

A cesarean delivery performed under general anesthesia was uneventful and the outcomes were excellent for both mother and fetus. General anesthesia was chosen because patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease often have asymptomatic spinal cord and intracranial involvement. As such involvement could not be ruled out, we preferred to avoid the risks related to regional anesthesia.

{"title": "In vivo administration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its antagonist, soluble neuropilin-1, predicts a role of VEGF in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia in vivo.", "abstract": "Recent findings implied that the progression of hematologic malignancies, like that of solid tumors, is dependent on neovascularization. Recent studies on patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed increased levels of leukocyte-associated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neovascularization of the bone marrow. Murine (32D, M1) and human (HEL, U937, and UKE-1) leukemic cell lines and freshly isolated leukemic cells were analyzed for the expression of VEGF and VEGF receptor mRNA. The expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors KDR and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) was detected in these cells. In a murine chloroma model, delivery of VEGF(165) using microencapsulation technology resulted in enhanced tumor growth and vascularization, whereas treatment with a VEGF antagonist soluble NRP-1 (sNRP-1) inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth. In a systemic leukemia model, survival of mice injected with adenovirus (Ad) encoding for Fc-sNRP-1 (sNRP-1 dimer) was significantly prolonged as compared with mice injected with Ad-LacZ. Further analyses showed a reduction in circulating leukemic cells and infiltration of liver and spleen as well as bone marrow neovascularization and cellularity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that angiogenic factors such as VEGF promote AML progression in vivo. The use of VEGF antagonists as an antiangiogenesis approach offers a potential treatment for AML. Finally, our novel in vivo drug delivery model may be useful for testing the activities of other peptide antiangiogenic factors.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2002-11-28", "authors": ["GunterSchuch", "MarcelleMachluf", "GeorgBartsch", "MasashiNomi", "HenriRichard", "AnthonyAtala", "ShaySoker"], "doi": "10.1182/blood.V100.13.4622"}

{"title": "Vascularized islet-cell transplantation in miniature swine. I. Preparation of vascularized islet kidneys.", "abstract": "Whereas clinical pancreatic transplantation has been highly successful in correcting the hyperglycemia of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1), the results of islet transplantation have been disappointing. This discrepancy may be because of, at least in part, nonspecific loss of islets during the time required for revascularization. To test this hypothesis, we have designed composite kidney grafts containing vascularized autologous islets that can be used to compare the engraftment potential of vascularized versus nonvascularized islet tissue.\n(1) Islet-cell isolation: miniature swine underwent either partial pancreatectomy to isolate autologous islets or total pancreatectomy to isolate minor antigen-mismatched islets. Islets were purified from excised pancreatic tissue by enzymatic digestion and discontinuous density gradient purification. Isolated islets were cultured for 3 days before transplant. (2) Creation of vascularized islet kidneys (IK): autologous islets alone (n=6), minor-mismatched islets alone (n=3), and minor-mismatched islets plus simultaneous autologous thymic tissue (n=3) were transplanted beneath the renal capsule of juvenile miniature swine. Minor antigen-mismatched islets were also transplanted into both the vascularized thymic graft of a thymokidney (to produce a thymo-islet kidney [TIK]) and the contralateral native kidney (n=3) and both the host thymus and beneath the renal capsule (n=2). All recipients receiving minor-mismatched islets were treated with a 12-day intravenous (IV) course of either cyclosporine A (CsA) at 10 mg/kg per day or FK506 at 0.15 mg/kg per day. (3) Assessment of Function: to evaluate the function of the transplanted islets, three animals bearing TIK and IK underwent total pancreatectomy 3 months following islet transplantation.\n(1) Islet-cell yields: an average of 254,960+/-51,879 (4,452+/-932 islet equivalents [IEQ]/gram of pancreas) and 374,410+/-9,548 (4,183+/-721 IEQ/gram of pancreas) viable islets were obtained by partial pancreatectomy and complete pancreatectomy, respectively. (2) Creation of IK: autologous islets engrafted indefinitely, whereas recipients of minor-mismatched islets alone rejected the islets within 2 months. However, when minor-mismatched islets were implanted into both the thymokidney and the contralateral kidney of animals bearing a thymokidney, the islets engrafted indefinitely in both sites (>3 months). Simultaneous implantation of islets into the host thymus and under the renal capsule also led to permanent engraftment of minor-mismatched islets. (3) Function of vascularized islets: three animals with both a TIK and an IK in place for 3 months underwent total pancreatectomy. All three animals maintained normoglycemia thereafter. In two of these animals, the IKs were removed 2 months after the pancreatectomy, and in both cases normoglycemia was maintained thereafter by the TIK.\nThe implantation of islets beneath the autologous renal capsule permitted the establishment of a vascular supply and thereby supported normal islet-cell growth and function. The presence of thymic tissue beneath the autologous renal capsule facilitated the engraftment of minor-mismatched islets, and such grafts achieved results similar to autologous islet transplants. Therefore, the ability to create vascularized islet grafts may provide a strategy for successful islet transplantation across allogeneic and potentially across xenogeneic barriers.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2002-11-27", "authors": ["NaokiKumagai", "John JO'Neil", "Rolf NBarth", "John CLaMattina", "RyuUtsugi", "Shannon GMoran", "ShinYamamoto", "Parsia AVagefi", "HiroshiKitamura", "ChisakoKamano", "David HSachs", "KazuhikoYamada"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200211150-00005"}

In the present study, we focused on the role of allogeneic blood lymphocytes in early immune alterations following lung reperfusion.\nWe developed an experimental model of isolated and ventilated lung in female C57BL/6 mouse perfused with either isogeneic (C57BL/6) or allogeneic (C3H/He) male mouse fresh blood for 3 hours. SRY DNA quantification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assess the presence of perfusate cells in lung extract. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, we measured mRNA expression both of the adhesion molecules--intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-3, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1--and of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in lung tissue.\nThe number of blood lymphocytes is significantly decreased in allogeneic versus isogeneic condition at 3 hours of perfusion, without evidence of increased apoptosis or necrosis. In parallel, SRY DNA quantity recovered in the lung was 2.5 times higher in allogeneic condition, which was related to cells loosely adherent to endothelial cells. Lastly, the levels of mRNAs of all adhesion molecules and of TNF-alpha were significantly increased in allogeneic versus isogeneic conditions.\nThese results demonstrate that an early interaction between allogeneic blood lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells is correlated with a high mRNA expression both of adhesion molecules and of TNF-alpha in the perfused lung.

{"title": "Dry matter accumulation in citrus fruit is not limited by transport capacity of the pedicel.", "abstract": "The vascularization of the pedicel in Marisol clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tanaka) has been characterized in relation to fruit growth. Phloem and xylem formation occurred during the first half of the period of fruit growth. Phloem cross-sectional area reached its maximum value by the end of fruitlet abscission, 78 d after anthesis (DAA), shortly after the rate of accumulation of dry matter in fruitlets reached its maximum value. Secondary xylem formation occurred until day 93, well after the end of fruitlet abscission. At fruit maturity, xylem accounted for 42-46 % of the cross-section of the pedicel. Vessels differentiated in this late-formed xylem. Formation of phloem and early xylem was directly related to fruitlet size (and growth rate). Differences in the rate of formation of conductive tissues in the pedicel of the developing fruitlets followed rather than preceded the differences in growth rate. Specific mass transfer (SMT) in the phloem was highest in the fastest growing fruitlets, and peaked during the late stages of fruitlet abscission (72-78 DAA) and during the main period of fruit growth (107-121 DAA). Application of a synthetic auxin to developing fruits, either at the end of flowering (2,4-D) or by day 64 after flowering (2,4-DP), increased the growth rate of the fruit and fruit size at maturity (8-13 % increase in fruit diameter at maturity). These auxin applications also enhanced the formation of conductive tissues in the pedicel, with a specific effect on phloem formation. Applying auxin at flowering resulted in a reduction in the phloem SMT by days 72-78, whereas auxin application on day 64 increased this parameter. Despite this difference in behaviour, which resulted from the different time-course of the growth response of the fruit to auxin applications, these applications increased fruit size to a similar extent. Severing 37 % of the phloem of the pedicel during the main period of fruit growth resulted in an increase in the specific mass transfer in the phloem but had no influence on fruit growth. These observations demonstrate that the transport capacity in the phloem of the pedicel does not limit fruit growth and, within the limits of our experiments, an increase in demand by the fruit appeared to be matched by an increase in SMT. The dependence of late xylem formation (after the period of fruitlet abscission) on fruitlet growth was demonstrated in Salustiana orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] by means of controlling fruit growth through the manipulation of leaf area. Fruit growth at this time was more closely related to leaf area than to carbohydrate levels, suggesting that it may be limited by current photosynthesis.", "journal": "Annals of botany", "date": "2002-11-27", "authors": ["AGarcia-Luis", "M E MOliveira", "YBordon", "D LSiqueira", "STominaga", "J LGuardiola"], "doi": "10.1093/aob/mcf257"}

Anti-angiogenic approaches to prevent and treat cancer represent a priority area in investigative tumor biology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role for the vascularization of tumors. The vasculature in adult skin remains normally quiescent. However, skin retains the capacity for brisk initiation of angiogenesis during inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and skin cancers. We sought to test the effects of multiple berry extracts on inducible VEGF expression by human HaCaT keratinocytes. Six berry extracts (wild blueberry, bilberry, cranberry, elderberry, raspberry seed, and strawberry) and a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) were studied. The extracts and uptake of their constituents by HaCaT were studied using a multi-channel HPLC-CoulArray approach. Antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by ORAC. Cranberry, elderberry and raspberry seed samples were observed to possess comparable ORAC values. The antioxidant capacity of these samples was significantly lower than that of the other samples studied. The ORAC values of strawberry powder and GSPE were higher than cranberry, elderberry or raspberry seed but significantly lower than the other samples studied. Wild bilberry and blueberry extracts possessed the highest ORAC values. Each of the berry samples studied significantly inhibited both H2O2 as well as TNF alpha induced VEGF expression by the human keratinocytes.

The junctional region between the single ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus has been studied by conventional light microscopy, and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, fluorescent phalloidin and antibodies against the muscle myosin heavy chains, laminin and collagen type IV have been used. The conus arteriosus is a distinct muscular segment interposed between the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus. It is clearly different from the bulbus arteriosus due to its myocardial nature. It can also be distinguished from the ventricular myocardium because: (1) it has a conus shape; (2) it is formed by compact, well-vascularized myocardium; (3) it is surrounded on its inner and outer faces by fibrous layers rich in collagen and elastin; (4) it constitutes the anatomical support of the so-termed conus valves; (5) it shows intense staining for laminin and type-IV collagen; and (6) the myocardial cells located close to the inner fibrous layer are helicoidally arranged. By contrast, the ventricular myocardium is highly trabecular, lacks a compacta, shows no vessels, and presents barely detectable amounts of laminin and collagen type IV. The presence of a distinct conus arteriosus in the heart of an evolutionary advanced teleost species indicates that the conus is not a vestigial segment from the evolutionary or embryological points of view.

We tested the angiogenic potential of 9 cell lines of pancreatic ductal carcinoma origin by screening mRNA and protein expression of VEGF and bFGF and the release of VEGF into culture medium under normoxic and hypoxic (5% or 0.2% O2) conditions. Angiogenic activity was determined using 2- and 3-D endothelial cell assays. Furthermore, VEGF expression and tumor vascularization were studied in human pancreatic carcinoma tissues from orthotopic xenografts and resection specimens. All cell lines expressed (mRNA, protein) and secreted VEGF, whereas bFGF was only found in 3 cell lines and was secreted into the medium in low concentrations. In addition to the dominant isoforms VEGF121,VEGF165 and VEGF189, 2 isoforms described recently, VEGF145 and VEGF183, were detected.

The distally based lesser saphenous venofasciocutaneous flap mobilized from the posterior aspect of the upper leg, used as an island pedicle skin flap, can be useful for this purpose. The vascular supply to the flap is derived from the retrograde perfusion of the accompanying arteries of the lesser saphenous vein. These arteries descend along both sides of the lesser saphenous vein to the distal third of the leg, either terminating or anastomosing with the septocutaneous perforators of the peroneal artery.

Skin defects among all patients were combined with bone, joint, and/or tendon exposure. The authors found that the flap was reliable and technically simple to design and execute. This one-stage procedure not only preserves the major arteries and the sural nerve of the injured leg, but it also has proved valuable for covering a weight-bearing heel and filling a deep defect, because it potentially provides protective sensation and a well-vascularized muscle fragment.

Flaps raised after vascular injection were examined radiographically to evaluate the vascular anatomy of the lateral thigh skin independent of flap elevation. When vascular injection was made into the profunda femoris, the upper two-thirds of the flaps was better visualized than the distal third. When the injection was made into the popliteal artery, the vasculature of the distal third of the flaps was better visualized. Flaps raised before vascular injection were examined radiographically to delineate the anatomical territory of the vascular pedicle that had been injected. In these flaps, consistent cutaneous vascular supply was only seen in the skin overlying the tensor fasciae latae muscle, confirming that musculocutaneous perforators are the predominant means by which the pedicle of the tensor fasciae latae flap supplies the skin of the lateral thigh. Extended tensor fasciae latae flaps were elevated bilaterally in one cadaver, and selective methylene blue injections were made into the lateral circumflex femoral artery on one side and into the superior lateral genicular artery on the contralateral side. Methylene blue was observed in the proximal and distal thirds of the skin paddles, respectively, leaving unstained midzones. The vascular network of the lateral thigh skin could be divided into three zones. The lateral circumflex femoral artery and the third perforating branches of the profunda femoris artery perfuse the proximal and middle zones of the lateral thigh skin, respectively. The superior lateral genicular artery branch of the popliteal artery perfuses the distal zone. The middle and distal zones meet 8 to 10 cm above the knee joint, where the skin paddle of the tensor fasciae latae flap becomes unreliable.

In a search by the yeast two-hybrid system using the eNOS oxygenase domain as bait, we have identified a previously uncharacterized eNOS-interacting protein, dubbed NOSTRIN (for eNOS traffic inducer). NOSTRIN contains a single polypeptide chain of 506-aa residues of 58 kDa with an N-terminal cdc15 domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. NOSTRIN mRNA is abundant in highly vascularized tissues such as placenta, kidney, lung, and heart, and NOSTRIN protein is expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the eNOS-NOSTRIN interaction in vitro and in vivo, and NOSTRIN's SH3 domain was essential and sufficient for eNOS binding. NOSTRIN colocalized extensively with eNOS at the plasma membrane of confluent human umbilical venous endothelial cells and in punctate cytosolic structures of CHO-eNOS cells. NOSTRIN overexpression induced a profound redistribution of eNOS from the plasma membrane to vesicle-like structures matching the NOSTRIN pattern and at the same time led to a significant inhibition of NO release. We conclude that NOSTRIN contributes to the intricate protein network controlling activity, trafficking, and targeting of eNOS.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2002-11-26", "authors": ["KirstinZimmermann", "NilsOpitz", "JurgenDedio", "ChristophRenne", "WernerMuller-Esterl", "StefanieOess"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.252345399"}
{"title": "Transplantation of embryonic kidneys.", "abstract": "The number of kidney allotransplants performed per year is limited by the availability of human donor organs. Xenotransplantation of a vascularized organ, such as the kidney, as an alternative to allotransplantation presents formidable immunological challenges. One novel solution to this conundrum is to use embryonic kidneys taken from animal donors early during organogenesis when metanephroi can be transplanted in 'cellular' form. We and others have shown that developing embryonic kidneys (metanephroi) transplanted into the omentum of animal hosts undergo differentiation and growth in situ, become vascularized by blood vessels of host origin and exhibit excretory function. Metanephroi can be stored for up to 3 days in vitro prior to transplantation with no impairment in growth or function post-implantation. Metanephroi can be transplanted across both concordant (rat to mouse) and highly disparate/discordant (pig to rodent) xenogeneic barriers.

{"title": "Cyr61 promotes breast tumorigenesis and cancer progression.", "abstract": "Cyr61, a member of the CCN family of genes, is an angiogenic factor. We have shown that it is overexpressed in invasive and metastatic human breast cancer cells and tissues. Here, we investigated whether Cyr61 is necessary and/or sufficient to bypass the 'normal' estrogen (E2) requirements for breast cancer cell growth. Our results demonstrate that Cyr61 is sufficient to induce MCF-7 cells to grow in the absence of E2. Cyr61-transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/Cyr61) became E2-independent but still E2-responsive. On the other hand, MCF-7 cells transfected with the vector DNA (MCF-7/V) remain E2-dependent. MCF-7/Cyr61 cells acquire an antiestrogen-resistant phenotype, one of the most common clinical occurrences during breast cancer progression. MCF-7/Cyr61 cells are anchorage-independent and capable of forming Matrigel outgrowth patterns in the absence of E2. ER alpha expression in MCF-7/Cyr61 cells is decreased although still functional. Moreover, MCF-7/Cyr61 cells are tumorigenic in ovariectomized athymic nude mice. The tumors resemble human invasive carcinomas with increased vascularization and overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our results demonstrate that Cyr61 is a tumor-promoting factor and a key regulator of breast cancer progression. This study provides evidence that Cyr61 is sufficient to induce E2-independence and antiestrogen-resistance, and to promote invasiveness in vitro, and to induce tumorigenesis in vivo, all of which are characteristics of an aggressive breast cancer phenotype.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2002-11-22", "authors": ["Miaw-SheueTsai", "Daphne FBogart", "Jessica MCasta\u00f1eda", "PatriciaLi", "RuthLupu"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1205682"}
{"title": "Rapid tumor development and potent vascularization are independent events in carcinoma producing FGF-1 or FGF-2.", "abstract": "FGF-1 and FGF-2 are pleiotropic growth factors for many cell types, operating through the activation of specific transmembrane FGF receptors (FGFRs). The role of these factors in tumor progression was investigated, with specific discrimination between their autocrine and non autocrine cellular activity. The rat bladder carcinoma NBT-II cells were engineered to produce FGF-1 or 18 kDa FGF-2 in the presence or absence of their specific receptor. Non-autocrine cells that produced FGF-1 or FGF-2 but lacked FGFRs were epithelial and reminiscent of the parental NBT-II cells. Whilst autocrine cells, which both constitutively produced and secreted the growth factor and expressed FGFRs, had a highly invasive mesenchymal phenotype. Correspondingly, the autocrine cells were highly tumorigenic in vivo compared to the parental and non-autocrine cells, which correlated with the increased production of uPAR and active uPA and increased in vitro invasive potential. Although all cells produced VEGF, only tumors derived from cells that produced FGF-1 or FGF-2 were highly vascularized, suggesting that these two growth factors could be involved in the angiogenic process by activating host endothelial cells. As a result of activation of the FGFR in autocrine cells, changes in cell morphology and an increase in the invasive and tumorigenic properties were observed, however no in vitro or in vivo differential functions between FGF-1 and FGF-2 could be identified in this system. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that rapid tumor development is not dependent upon increased tumor vascularization, suggesting that 'basal' angiogenesis, probably mediated by VEGF, is sufficient to support tumor growth.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2002-11-22", "authors": ["ClotildeBillottet", "BassamJanji", "Jean-PaulThiery", "JacquelineJouanneau"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1205935"}

We have used primary cultures of resting or IFN-gamma-activated C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) vascular endothelial cells as stimulators and CD8(+) T lymphocytes isolated from CBA/J (H-2(k)) mice as responders. Resting endothelium expressed low levels of MHC class I, which was markedly up-regulated after activation with IFN-gamma. It also expressed moderate levels of CD80 at a resting state and after activation. Both resting and activated endothelium were able to induce proliferation of unprimed CD8(+) T lymphocytes, with proliferation noted at earlier time points after coculture with activated endothelium. Activated endothelium was also able to induce proliferation of CD44(low) naive CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Activated CD8(+) T lymphocytes had the ability to produce IFN-gamma and IL-2, acquired an effector phenotype, and showed up-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x(L). Treatment with CTLA4-Ig led to marked reduction of T cell proliferation and a decrease in expression of Bcl-x(L). Moreover, we demonstrate that nonhemopoietic cells such as vascular endothelium induce proliferation of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in a B7-dependent fashion in vivo. These results suggest that vascular endothelium can act as an APC for CD8(+) direct allorecognition and may, therefore, play an important role in regulating immune processes of allograft rejection.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2002-11-22", "authors": ["DanielKreisel", "Alexander SKrupnick", "Keki RBalsara", "MarkusRiha", "Andrew EGelman", "Sicco HPopma", "Wilson YSzeto", "Laurence ATurka", "Bruce RRosengard"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.169.11.6154"}

Peritoneal endometriosis, the different aspects of which (black, red and white) represent distinctive steps in the evolutionary process, can be explained by the transplantation theory. Red lesions are the most active and most highly vascularized lesions and are considered to be the first stage of peritoneal endometriosis. The retroperitoneal nodule is an adenomyotic nodule whose histopathogenesis is not related to the implantation of regurgitated endometrial cells but to metaplasia of M\u00fcllerian remnants located in the rectovaginal septum. Metaplastic changes of M\u00fcllerian rests into adenomyotic glands involving the rectovaginal septum and the retroperitoneal space are responsible for the striking proliferation of the smooth muscle, creating an adenomyomatous appearance similar to that of adenomyosis in the endometrium.", "journal": "Gynecologic and obstetric investigation", "date": "2002-11-21", "authors": ["JacquesDonnez", "AnneVan Langendonckt", "Fran\u00e7coiseCasanas-Roux", "Jean-PaulVan Gossum", "C\u00e9linePirard", "PascaleJadoul", "JeanSquifflet", "MieilleSmets"], "doi": "10.1159/000066295"}
{"title": "Disc morphology in health and disease.", "abstract": "The morphology of the intervertebral disc is dependent on the type of components present and the manner in which they are assembled. This, in turn, will determine how the tissue carries out its primary physiological functions of load bearing and allowing movement in all directions of the otherwise rigid spine. The disc starts its life in an ordered fashion, with the outer annulus fibrosus consisting of a series of regular concentric bundles of collagen fibres around the central gelatinous nucleus pulposus. With advancing age there is increased complexity of lamellae, with more bifurcations, interdigitations and irregularity in number and size of lamellar bands, probably as a result of the disc cells' synthetic response to variations in incident loads. This change in organization itself will lead to altered load bearing, hence possibly establishing a self-perpetuating cycle of disruption to disc morphology, which, once started, may be irreversible. There are also alterations to cell organization with disease and degeneration. There may be increased cell number, with clusters of cells forming by cell proliferation, or increased cell death, whether by necrosis or apoptosis, in degenerate or deformed discs such as are found in spinal deformities; for example, scoliosis. Any change in cell number is likely to alter the nutritive requirements and concentration gradients of both nutrients and metabolites. The normally avascular disc in the healthy adult can become increasingly vascularized and innervated with degeneration and disease. This may lead to an increased supply of oxygen and nutrients to the disc, but can also introduce other cells types and molecules such as cytokines and growth factors.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2002-11-21", "authors": ["SRoberts"], "doi": "10.1042/bst0300864"}

{"title": "Bisphosphonates inhibit angiogenesis in vitro and testosterone-stimulated vascular regrowth in the ventral prostate in castrated rats.", "abstract": "Bisphosphonates (BPs) are used currently in the treatment of patients with bone metastases because these compounds inhibit bone resorption. We examined here the effects of BPs on inhibition of endothelial cell functions in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of endothelial cells with BPs (clodronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid) reduced proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Quantification of blood vessels in bone biopsy specimens from patients with Paget's disease before and after clodronate treatment showed a 40% reduction of the vascularization after BP treatment. However, such a decreased vascularity could be secondary to a reduction of bone resorption. Therefore, the tissue distribution of [14C]BPs in male rats was examined to develop an angiogenesis model in a noncalcified tissue where BPs could accumulate. [14C]BPs (zoledronic acid, ibandronate, and clodronate) not only accumulated in bone but also transiently accumulated in the prostate. The effects of BPs on testosterone-induced revascularization of the prostate gland in castrated rats were then studied. Testosterone in combination with ibandronate or zoledronic acid induced a 17-35% reduction of the prostate weight compared with castrated rats treated with testosterone alone. Blood vessel immunostaining on prostate tissue sections revealed that both ibandronate and zoledronic acid induced a 50% reduction of the revascularization of the prostate gland. Moreover, zoledronic acid did not alter testosterone-induced activity of a luciferase gene reporter construct transfected in androgen-dependent prostatic cells, indicating that this BP did not directly interfere with testosterone. In conclusion, BPs have in vivo antiangiogenic properties, which could be of relevance to improve therapy and prevention of bone metastasis.

Only recently, the clinical significance of neovascularization in hematological neoplasms has come into the focus of scientific efforts. Emerging data from these studies suggest that the vascular architecture exerts a pivotal role in acute leukemias and multiple myeloma as well as myeloproliferative disorders. Thus, angiogenesis seems to maintain a general condition for malignant growth and the progression of hematological diseases. However, a major shortcoming is that most of the previous studies include only a simple quantitative evaluation of the microvessel density, and applied methods which were developed primarily for the characterization of angiogenesis in solid tumors. In this context it should not be overlooked that solid neoplasms and the bone marrow reveal significant differences regarding the vascular structures and the distribution of microvessels. Therefore, the usually applied, so-called hot-spot techniques, should be amended by an appropriate and more elaborate computer-assisted morphometric analysis of the microvessel structures.

{"title": "Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 is a key adhesion molecule in melanoma cell adhesion to the leptomeninges.", "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastases occur in up to 8% of patients with systemic malignancies and have a poor prognosis. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic processes underlying leptomeningeal metastases is needed for more effective treatment strategies. We hypothesized that tumor cells will have to adhere to the well-vascularized leptomeninges, because the cerebrospinal fluid lacks nutrients and growth factors for efficient tumor cell proliferation. Specific receptor-ligand interactions, which are unknown until now, will mediate this adhesion process. We determined the growth characteristics of B16F-10 melanoma cells in cerebrospinal fluid. The expression levels of specific adhesion molecules on both mouse leptomeningeal cells (MLMC) and murine B16F-10 melanoma cells were measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. We used mAbs to determine the function of these specific adhesion molecules on B16F-10 melanoma cell adhesion to a leptomeningeal cell layer under static and (cerebrospinal fluid-like) flow conditions. B16F-10 melanoma cells did not proliferate in cerebrospinal fluid because of a lack of nutrients and growth factors. MLMC expressed low levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), beta1- and beta3-integrin subunits, and CD44. VCAM-1 expression on MLMC was shown to be up-regulated by TNF-alpha. Blocking VCAM-1 on the MLMC with a mAb resulted in a 60% inhibition of melanoma cell adhesion to a leptomeningeal cell layer under flow but not under static conditions. No additive inhibitory effect on melanoma cell adhesion was found by concomitant blocking of the beta1- and beta3-integrin subunits and CD44 with mAbs. Our experiments indicate that cerebrospinal fluid does not support B16F-10 melanoma cell proliferation, suggesting the need for melanoma cell adhesion to the well-vascularized leptomeninges.

{"title": "Vasculogenesis Plays a Role in the Growth of Ewing's Sarcoma in Vivo.", "abstract": "Vasculogenesis, the process by which endothelial cell precursors are recruited and organized to form a vasculature, has traditionally been thought to play a role only in embryonic development. However, several studies have now been published suggesting that vasculogenesis may have a role in the formation of new vascular networks during postnatal life. Recent studies suggest the existence of circulating endothelial precursor cells that arise from outside the place of vascularization. Using a mouse bone marrow (BM) transplantation model that takes advantage of MHC haplotype differences between donor and recipient mice, we examined the contribution of donor BM-derived cells to neovascularization in recipient nude mice with developing Ewing's sarcoma tumors. We found that the donor BM cells gave rise to endothelial cells in vitro and colocalized with neovessels in Ewing's sarcomas in vivo. We also found that donor BM-derived cells were involved in the formation of the tumor vasculature. Our findings indicate that not only angiogenesis but also vasculogenesis was involved in the development of Ewing's sarcoma in our mouse model.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2002-11-14", "authors": ["Marcela FBolontrade", "Rong-RongZhou", "Eugenie SKleinerman"], "doi": null}

We hypothesized that preengrafting SC would allow one to develop a vascularized immunoprivileged ectopic site that provides protection for mouse islet allografts. SC, prepared from 9-day Balb/c mice, were transplanted under the kidney capsule in adult Balb/c mice. After SC engraftment (approximately 30 days), mice were rendered diabetic and subsequently implanted with Balb/c or CBA/J islets directly adjacent to the established SC grafts. Preengrafted SC (5.7 +/- 0.2 x 106) had no adverse effect on syngeneic islet graft function. When allogeneic islets were transplanted into the immunoprivileged ectopic site created by preengrafting 6.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) SC, mean graft survival was slightly prolonged (32.4 +/- 6.0 days) compared with control mice that received allogeneic islets alone (16.3 +/- 1.5 days; p = 0.329). In contrast, when 4.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(6) SC were preengrafted, islet allograft survival was significantly prolonged (66.1 +/- 9.8 days; p = 0.001). Four of eight mice, preimplanted with 4.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(6) SC, remained normoglycemic throughout the follow-up period (83.8 +/- 8.6 days) and returned to a diabetic state only when the kidneys bearing the composite grafts were removed. Transplantation of islets into an immunoprivileged ectopic site created by preengrafting SC did not affect islet function and, moreover, provided a means of developing an immunopriveliged ectopic site that permits prolonged islet allograft survival without systemic immunosuppression.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2002-11-14", "authors": ["TatsuyaKin", "Ray VRajotte", "Jannette MDufour", "Gregory SKorbutt"], "doi": null}

In this study we investigated the submucosal space of the duodenum in Syrian golden hamsters. Following transplantation of more than 800 islets into streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic hamsters, basal nonfasted blood glucose levels decreased from 403 +/- 14 to 143 +/- 10 mg/dl within 5 weeks posttransplantation. In these animals, in vivo islet function, as determined by intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), was similar to nondiabetic controls (K values: 1.16 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.06, respectively) and was significantly greater than diabetic controls (K value: 0.47 +/- 0.07). Islets transplanted into the submucosal space become richly vascularized within 2 weeks, and there is minimal host inflammatory infiltrate. The beta-cells of the graft remain well granulated with insulin for at least 129 days.

Additionally, calcified fibrocartilage from tendon and ligament insertions comprises a significant portion of the fractional area of the proximal femur's cortical shell. The goal of the present investigation was to quantify and compare the microvascularity of the cortical bone and calcified fibrocartilage of the proximal femur in a sheep model. There were no regional differences in the vascular density of the cortical bone. However, the calcified fibrocartilage from tendon and capsular insertions were determined to be avascular, and regions of the proximal femur with insertions lacked a vascularized periosteum. If a vessel was present in the calcified fibrocartilage, it was located within an isolated region of bone tissue or osteoid. Since blood vessels appear to be a significant contributor to the health and remodeling of mineralized tissue, it is hypothesized that the large areas of avascular calcified fibrocartilage present on the elderly femoral neck may predispose these regions to damage accumulation. Therefore future research should examine the role of the vascularity to the proximal femur in the mechanisms of numerous pathological conditions, such as avascular necrosis, osteopenia, and hip fractures.", "journal": "The Anatomical record", "date": "2002-11-07", "authors": ["Jill EShea", "Rhett KHallows", "ShannonRicks", "Roy DBloebaum"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.10173"}

GnT I adds a GlcNAc residue in beta1,2 glycosidic linkage to the Man(alpha)1,3 arm of the N-glycan core to initiate the biosynthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans. GnT I.2 can add GlcNAc in beta1,2 linkage to any alpha-linked terminal Man residue but has a strong preference for the Man(alpha)1-O-Thr- moiety which occurs in alpha-dystroglycan and other O-mannosylated glycoproteins.

The A431 cells exhibited typical in vitro cell adhesion to the endothelial F-2 cells. The initial step of adhesion was mediated by sialyl Lewis(x) (Le(x)) and sialyl Le(a), the carbohydrate determinants expressed on the cancer cells, and E-selectin expressed constitutively on F-2 cells. Prolonged culture led to the implantation of cancer cells into the monolayer of the F-2 cells, which was mediated mainly by alpha(3)beta(1)-integrin. F-2 cells cultured on Matrigel showed evident tube formation, and coculture of F-2 cells with A431 cells led to the formation of A431 cell nests constantly surrounded by tube-like networks consisting of F-2 cells. This in vitro morphogenesis was inhibited by the addition of anti-sialyl Le(x)/Le(a) or anti-beta(1)-integrin antibodies, which led to the formation of cancer cell aggregates that were independent from the F-2 cell networks. This in vitro morphological appearance was exactly reproduced in the in vivo tumors, which were formed when the mixture of A431 and F-2 cells at the ratio of 10:1 were cotransplanted s.c. into the back of nude rats. The tumors of A431 supplemented with F-2 cells were profoundly vascularized throughout by the tubular structures formed by F-2 cells, the lumen of which contained the host rat blood cells. The tumor mass thus formed was an average 5.8-fold as large as control A431 tumors that were grown without F-2 cells. The co-injection of anti-Le(x)/Le(a) or anti-beta(1)-integrin antibodies produced a marked reduction in the size of A431 tumors, which were not vascularized and accompanied an independent tiny remnant clump of F-2 cells. The size of these A431 tumors did not differ significantly from those of control A431 tumors raised without F-2 cells. These results indicate that the interaction of tumor cells and endothelial cells in orderly tumor angiomorphogenesis is highly dependent on the action of cell adhesion molecules mediating the adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells, inhibition of which remarkably retards tumor growth and angiogenesis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-11-05", "authors": ["KouTei", "NaokoKawakami-Kimura", "OsamuTaguchi", "KensukeKumamoto", "ShigekiHigashiyama", "NaoyukiTaniguchi", "Ken'ichiToda", "RyoKawata", "YasuoHisa", "ReijiKannagi"], "doi": null}

Of 34 operated eyes, full corneal epithelialization was achieved in 19 eyes (55.9%) within 5 days and in 32 eyes (94.1%) within 7 days after surgery. Delayed epithelial healing occurred in two eyes (5.9%). The reconstructed corneal surface remained stable, and the renewed epithelium was characterized cytologically by nonkeratinized squamous cells without goblet cells. After surgery in 11 of 34 eyes, fluid was identified between Descemet's membrane and the donor corneal graft, resulting in a pseudochamber that completely resolved in 10 eyes within 30 days.

Since most diseases that cause catastrophic loss of vision do so as a result of abnormal ocular angiogenesis, a better understanding of events regulating normal retinal vascular growth may provide insight into pathologic angiogenesis.\nDevelopment of the retinal vasculature at various postnatal and embryonic time points was analyzed by collagen IV immunohistochemistry and staining with isolectin Griffonia simplicifolia. GFAP-GFP transgenic mice were used to evaluate the relationship between developing vessels and retinal glial cells. Immunolocalization of R-cadherin and intravitreous injection of R-cadherin-specific antibodies was performed to determine the role of R-cadherin during patterning of the superficial and deep retinal vascular plexuses.\nThe characteristic honeycomb pattern of vessel formation observed in the superficial layer is a result of endothelial cell migration over a preexisting astrocytic template. Filopodial extensions associate with underlying astrocytes by protruding from the tips of endothelial cells at the migrating vascular front. Branching of vessels in the primary vascular plexus, as well as appropriate localization of the deep vascular network is mediated by R-cadherin, an adhesion molecule known to be involved in neuronal cell guidance. Injection of antibodies directed against R-cadherin prevents the normally extensive collateralization observed during formation of the superficial network. Injection of anti-R cadherin antibodies also dramatically affects vessels of the deep network. These vessels migrate beyond the normal turning point, penetrating into the deeper photoreceptor layer.\n. These studies suggest that angiogenesis and formation of vascular patterns in the retina may use many of the same developmental cues used by neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Furthermore, retinal vascular endothelial cell guidance mediated by filopodial extensions and neuronal guidance cues may represent a novel conceptual framework within which to study the establishment of vascular patterns in a variety of angiogenic systems.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2002-10-31", "authors": ["Michael IDorrell", "EdithAguilar", "MartinFriedlander"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Circulation is established in a stepwise pattern in the mammalian embryo.", "abstract": "To better understand the relationship between the embryonic hematopoietic and vascular systems, we investigated the establishment of circulation in mouse embryos by examining the redistribution of yolk sac-derived primitive erythroblasts and definitive hematopoietic progenitors. Our studies revealed that small numbers of erythroblasts first enter the embryo proper at 4 to 8 somite pairs (sp) (embryonic day 8.25 [E8.25]), concomitant with the proposed onset of cardiac function. Hours later (E8.5), most red cells remained in the yolk sac. Although the number of red cells expanded rapidly in the embryo proper, a steady state of approximately 40% red cells was not reached until 26 to 30 sp (E10). Additionally, erythroblasts were unevenly distributed within the embryo's vasculature before 35 sp. These data suggest that fully functional circulation is established after E10. This timing correlated with vascular remodeling, suggesting that vessel arborization, smooth muscle recruitment, or both are required. We also examined the distribution of committed hematopoietic progenitors during early embryogenesis. Before E8.0, all progenitors were found in the yolk sac. When normalized to circulating erythroblasts, there was a significant enrichment (20- to 5-fold) of progenitors in the yolk sac compared with the embryo proper from E9.5 to E10.5. These results indicated that the yolk sac vascular network remains a site of progenitor production and preferential adhesion even as the fetal liver becomes a hematopoietic organ.

The importance of vascularization during endochondral ossification was investigated during natural growth of the condyle and compared to that after forward mandibular positioning. The goal was to further our understanding of the cellular responses during functional appliance therapy with a view to extending the experiment into maturity. One hundred and fifty 35 days old Sprague-Dawley rats, 100 fitted with a bite-jumping appliance and 50 untreated, were divided into 10 groups. One group was sacrificed on each of experimental days 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 33, 37, 44, 51 and 60 respectively. Sagittal sections were cut and stained with VEGF antibodies and Periodic acid and Schiff's reagent (PAS). Each section was quantitatively analyzed with a computer assisted analyzing program and the temporal sequence of expression of VEGF and new bone formation during natural growth and after mandibular forward positioning was compared. There was significant increase in both vascularization and mandibular bone growth upon forward mandibular positioning and the highest amount of both were expressed in the posterior region of the condyle. The highest acceleration of vascularization preceded that of new bone formation. Thus, forward mandibular positioning was found to solicit a sequence of cellular events leading to increased vascularization and subsequently new bone formation resulting in enhanced condylar growth.", "journal": "The Angle orthodontist", "date": "2002-10-29", "authors": ["A B MRabie", "F Y CLeung", "AChayanupatkul", "UH\u00e4gg"], "doi": "10.1043/0003-3219(2002)072<0431:TCBNAB>2.0.CO;2"}

The microenvironment consists of the extracellular matrix, fibroblasts, migratory immune cells, and neural elements supported by a vascular network, all within a milieu of cytokines, growth factors, and bioactive peptides as well as proteolytic enzymes. Cells interact with the microenvironment via complex autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Proteolytic enzymes in melanoma may activate or release growth factors from the microenvironment or act directly on the microenvironment itself, thereby facilitating angiogenesis or tumor cell migration. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the expression, structure and function of proteolytic enzymes at or near the cell surface in cell-cell and cell-stroma interactions during melanoma progression. Cell-surface (membrane) peptidases are a multi-functional group of ectoenzymes that have been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation of many cellular systems.

To investigate the importance of hyaluronan in colon carcinoma tumor progression, we have expressed by stable transfection hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) and hyaluronidase 1 (Hyal1) in the rat colon carcinoma cell line, PROb. We found that hyaluronan overproduction led to a higher growth rate of tumor cells in vitro, and to a faster development of transplantable tumors in syngeneic rats, compared to the mock-transfectants. Has2 transfected PROb cells gave rise to tumors that were significantly less vascularized, but had a significantly larger viable tumor fraction compared to tumors generated from mock-transfectants. In contrast, Hyal1 overexpression suppressed the growth rate of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, tumors derived from Hyal1-transfected cells had a significantly larger necrotic area than tumors derived from mock- and Has2-transfectants.

To evaluate the expression of TSP in follicular and luteal development, ovarian cycles of Sprague-Dawley rats were synchronized and tissues collected daily at stages corresponding to the early antral, ovulatory, early luteal, and late luteal phases of the ovarian cycle. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses demonstrated that TSP-1 protein and its receptor, CD36, were present in the early antral phase and were localized primarily to the granulosa cells of antral follicles. Both proteins were also present immediately after ovulation and were localized to the developing corpus luteum. Messenger RNA for TSP-1 showed a similar pattern, with expression at the early antral and ovulatory phases. Protein and mRNA expression for TSP-2 was relatively delayed compared to TSP-1, although TSP-2 also was expressed in granulosa cells. Both TSP-1 and -2 were increased in response to LH stimulation in vitro, whereas TSP-2 was suppressed by FSH.

{"title": "Bioavailability of caseinophosphopeptide-bound iron.", "abstract": "Iron deficiency, one of the main worldwide nutritional deficiencies, results from the low bioavailability of most dietary iron, including cow milk. Hydrolysis of the cow milk protein casein produces low molecular weight caseinophosphopeptides (CPPs). Binding of iron to CPPs keeps it soluble in the digestive tract and prevents the formation of high molecular weight ferric hydroxides, which are poorly absorbed. Previous experimental studies have shown that iron bound to the phosphopeptide containing the first 25 amino acids of beta-casein, or beta-CN (1-25), is well absorbed and corrects efficiently iron deficiency. We sought to assess in vivo iron absorption and uptake by tissues involved in iron metabolism and storage (liver, spleen, bone marrow), using radiolabeled iron. beta-CN (1-25)-Fe displayed better absorption and tissue uptake by the vascularized rat loop model compared with a control substance, ferric ascorbate. The metabolism of beta-CN (1-25)-Fe labeled with iron 59, added to cow milk, was also studied in young women. Although the absorption of beta-CN (1-25)-Fe was not significantly higher than that of ferrous sulfate, it displayed significantly higher tissue uptake.

The large size of Pol-A(x) prevents extravascular diffusion and causes it to act solely in the endothelial luminal surface. This implies their cardiac effects are due to endothelial mediators. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and indomethacin, respectively, show that the three cardiac effects of Pol-A(1) were mediated by NO and PG, whereas for Pol-A(2A) and Pol-A(3) the mediator was mainly NO but not PG.

Allogenic transplantation was performed on 12-week-old male DA rats with the major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) RT1a (as the donor) and age-matched male Lewis rats with MHC RT1l (as the recipient), and isogenic transplantation was performed on 12-week-old male Lewis rats.

T-cell depletion experiments revealed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes are required for stimulation of the antitumor and antimetastatic immune response by B7.2-IgG/TC. Treatment of mice with SU6668 substantially inhibited tumor vascularization but did not inhibit tumor infiltration by T lymphocytes or the T-cell response to rmB7.2-IgG therapy. On the contrary, tumors in mice immunized with B7.2-IgG/TC and treated with SU6668 had higher numbers of tumor infiltrating T cells than tumors of other groups.

Flow is in Zone 1 at P(e) > P(i) > P(v), Zone 2 at P(i) > P(e) > P(v), and Zone 3 at P(i) > P(v) > P(e). A focal tissue pressure increase after stroke or trauma may lead to a transition from Zone 1 or 2 in the center to Zone 3 in the periphery. We hypothesize that the coexistence of different zones may lead to steal-like blood flow diversion in the perifocal area.\nWe used a lumped-parameter model of two parallel Starling resistors with a common inflow. The first resistor, with higher P(e), represented the area with increased tissue pressure. The second resistor, with P(e)' = 0, represented the surrounding area. We evaluated the effects of venous pressure on the flow distribution between the two Starling resistors.\nThe model demonstrated blood flow diversion toward the second Starling resistor with low external pressure. High inflow resistance facilitates this \"steal.\" Flow diversion is caused by effective outflow pressure differences for the Starling resistors (P(e) for the first and P(v) for the second). The venous pressure increase equilibrates the effective backpressure and decreases flow diversion. When the venous pressure equals the external tissue pressure, blood flow diversion (cerebral venous steal) is abolished. Although increased venous pressure causes global flow reduction, it may restore flow to more than 50% of baseline values in areas of increased tissue pressure.\nCerebral venous steal is a potential cause of secondary brain injury in areas of increased tissue pressure. It can be eliminated with increased venous pressure. Increased venous pressure may recruit the collapsed vascular network and correct perifocal perfusion maldistribution.

Its most widely recognized indications are radiation lesions, chronic osteomyelitis of the mandible, head and neck infections, malignant external otitis, sudden hypoacusia, chronic tinnitus, encephalitis, treatment of the gasseous embolus, skin grafts, vascularized flaps, cervicoencephalic traumas. HOT indications as a radiosensitizing and/or chemiosensitizing factor are still being studied. Both a review of the literature and our experience appear, beyond any doubt, to confirm that HOT promotes faster recovery and reduces hospital stays, thus qualifying as a new therapeutic aid that complements the usual well-established methods.", "journal": "Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale", "date": "2002-10-16", "authors": ["AFarri", "G CPecorari", "AEnrico", "ASartoris"], "doi": null}

Secondary granulation on free bone surfaces is often a lengthy process, as granulation primarily occurs from the edges of the wound. Hydrocolloid dressings are gaining increasing attention in this context. The question arises as to whether the positive properties of hydrocolloid dressings can bring about rapid and positive conditioning of the base of the wound in soft tissue defects with exposed bone in the head and face region, with a view to subsequent split-thickness skin graft transplantation.\nIn the period from 1997 to 2000, a total of 25 patients with soft tissue defects with exposed bone surfaces in the head and face region were treated with hydrocolloid dressings in the framework of a prospective clinical study.\nThe average time taken for complete granulation of the bone surface was 39.44 days (minimum, 10 days; maximum, 72 days). As a rule, this necessitated 12.8 changes of dressing (minimum, 3; maximum, 26). The granulation tissue was of good quality, generously vascularized, and occasionally exuberant at the edges of the wound\nOn the whole, the combination of hydrocolloid dressing and alginate compress was found to have significant advantages as regards conditioning the exposed bone surface.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2002-10-16", "authors": ["Jens Jvon Lindern", "BerndNiederhagen", "ThorstenAppel", "StefaanBerg\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1053/joms.2002.34979"}
{"title": "Increased radiosensitivity with chronic hypoxia in four human tumor cell lines.", "abstract": "It is well known that the radiosensitivity of tumor cells can be significantly reduced under hypoxic conditions. However, most of the reports in the literature refer to an experimental setup in which the supply of oxygen is kept low for a short period of time only. In tumors, chronic hypoxia would seem to be the more typical situation, because of an insufficient vascularization and the limited diffusion of oxygen into the tissue. Under such conditions, certain changes in the proliferation patterns of tumor cells, in which the cell cycle checkpoint protein p53 seems to play a role, have been shown to occur. We therefore decided to study radiosensitivity and cell cycle progression under conditions of chronic hypoxia in several human tumor cell lines differing in their p53 status.\nFour human tumor cell lines (melanomas Be11 and MeWo and squamous carcinomas 4197 and 4451) were incubated for 3 h, 24 h, and 72 h under either oxic or hypoxic conditions and subsequently exposed to graded doses of X-rays. In some cases, cells were kept under hypoxia for the same periods of time, but then reoxygenated immediately before irradiation. Cell survival was assessed with the usual colony formation assay, and cell cycle distributions were determined by two-parameter flow cytometry after labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).\nAs expected, the oxygen enhancement ratio at 3 h was 2.0 or more in all cases. Differences, however, became evident with longer incubation times. At 24 h, the sensitivity of cells kept under hypoxic conditions both before and during irradiation was practically unchanged with cell lines Be11, 4197, and 4451, but clearly increased with MeWo. This resulted in an oxygen enhancement ratio of only 1.1 for the latter cell line when the sensitivity of aerated cells was used as reference. Cells kept under hypoxia for 24 h and reoxygenated shortly before irradiation, however, also showed an increase in sensitivity, so that the oxygen enhancement ratio based on differences in irradiation atmosphere alone was still around 2.0. At 72 h, the two p53 wild-type cell lines were not available for experiments, because they quickly degenerated under hypoxic conditions. Both mutant cell lines now showed similar results, the sensitivity being increased with irradiation under continued hypoxia as well as after reoxygenation. The oxygen enhancement ratios with reference to aerated cells were 1.3 and 1.5 for MeWo and 4451, respectively. Flow cytometric measurements after labeling with BrdU revealed that in all cell lines, the fraction of active S-phase cells during incubation tended to decrease under hypoxic conditions. Only in the p53 mutant cell lines, however, was this accompanied by an increase of the percentage of S-phase cells that were not actively incorporating BrdU.\nIt is suggested that these quiescent cells in the S-phase compartment develop because of a general breakdown of cellular energy metabolism. In the p53 mutant cells, this may lead to a cessation of cell cycle progression in all phases alike, because checkpoint control has been lost; p53 wild-type cells, on the other hand, settle down preferentially in G(1) under the same conditions. Independently of the p53 status, however, energy depletion may be the cause of a decreased ability to cope with radiation damage and thus the cause of the observed increase in radiosensitivity. This would become more easily apparent in the p53 mutant cell lines, because they are less sensitive than the p53 wild types to hypoxia as such.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2002-10-16", "authors": ["FriedoZ\u00f6lzer", "ChristianStreffer"], "doi": "10.1016/s0360-3016(02)02963-2"}
{"title": "Cellular replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease--where we are today?", "abstract": "The concept of replacing lost dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease using mesencephalic brain cells from fetal cadavers has been supported by over 20 years of research in animals and over a decade of clinical studies. The ambitious goal of these studies was no less than a molecular and cellular \"cure\" for Parkinson's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, and spinal cord injury. Much research has been done in rodents, and a few studies have been done in nonhuman primate models. Early uncontrolled clinical reports were enthusiastic, but the outcome of the first randomized, double blind, controlled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure Parkinson's disease, although there were some significant positive findings. Were the earlier animal studies and clinical reports wrong? Should we give up on the goal? Some aspects of the trial design and implantation methods may have led to lack of effects and to some side effects such as dyskinesias. But a detailed review of clinical neural transplants published to date still suggests that neural transplantation variably reverses some aspects of Parkinson's disease, although differing methods make exact comparisons difficult. While the randomized clinical studies have been in progress, new methods have shown promise for increasing transplant survival and distribution, reconstructing the circuits to provide dopamine to the appropriate targets and with normal regulation. Selected promising new strategies are reviewed that block apoptosis induced by tissue dissection, promote vascularization of grafts, reduce oxidant stress, provide key growth factors, and counteract adverse effects of increased age. New sources of replacement cells and stem cells may provide additional advantages for the future.

Postoperatively, posteroanterior radiographs of the chest were taken to locate vessel clips used to ligate the DICPs. The combined study results showed that the dominant DICP is the sixth or seventh in most instances, but there are some anatomical variations.

We investigated the role of porcine FasL in the generation of the human anti-pig response in vitro. Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) lysed a Fas+ human T-cell line, Jurkat. Anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb) specifically inhibited this killing in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that porcine FasL recognizes and binds human Fas to induce apoptosis of human Fas+ cells. We next cloned porcine FasL, identifying an open reading frame of 849 base pairs predicting a protein of 282 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence was 85, 76, and 75% homologous to the predicted amino acid sequences of human, mouse, and rat, respectively, and found that PAEC expressed both FasL mRNA and protein. Transient transfection was used to increase or induce porcine FasL expression in PAEC or COS-7 cells. Transfection of PAEC with a plasmid encoding porcine FasL increased their ability to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells, fresh human T cells activated with IL-2 and anti-CD3, and fresh IL-2-activated human (natural killer) NK cells. Moreover, porcine Fas L-transfected COS-7 cells induced significant apoptosis in Jurkat cells compared with that induced by mock-transfected COS-7 cells. Finally, the overexpression of porcine FasL in PAEC reduced their susceptibility as target cells to lysis by activated human NK or T cells.

{"title": "Management of fossa navicularis strictures.", "abstract": "The correction of strictures involving the fossa navicularis poses a distinct reconstructive challenge. Unlike surgical repair of strictures involving other urethral segments where the primary concern is restoration of urethral patency, management of fossa navicularis strictures also requires particular attention to cosmesis. Paramount to the success of any of the described procedures is the careful selection of nondiseased tissue for substitution. If the penile skin is healthy, the preferred urethral substitute is the fasciocutaneous ventral transverse island flap. The inherent characteristics of this versatile flap (i.e., well-vascularized predictable pedicle, nonhair bearing, negligible contraction) provide for an excellent time-tested glandular urethral substitute. In rare cases in which there is a suggestion of penile skin inflammation or scarring, extragenital tissue transfer techniques should be considered. Equally important is the need to substitute the entire length of diseased urethra, preferably as an onlay, preserving the dorsal urethral wall. Persistent proximal urethral disease will eventually result in further stricture formation. Finally, the choice of glanduloplasty is particularly important in achieving a cosmetically appealing outcome. A glans-cap repair is preferred because of the limited dissection required with this relatively simple and bloodless technique. Careful selection of the most appropriate combined urethral substitution and glans reconstruction techniques, as well as meticulous attention to surgical details, are mandatory for achieving a satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcome with fossa navicularis strictures.", "journal": "The Urologic clinics of North America", "date": "2002-10-10", "authors": ["Noel AArmenakas", "Jack WMcAninch"], "doi": "10.1016/s0094-0143(02)00050-2"}
{"title": "Penile circular fasciocutaneous flaps to reconstruct complex anterior urethral strictures.", "abstract": "The circular fasciocutaneous penile flap meets all criteria for tissue transfer and urethral reconstruction. It reliably provides ample hairless tissue, usually 13 to 15 cm long, without compromising cosmesis or function. We find it ideal for long strictures in the distal or pendulous urethra, where the decreased substance of the corpus spongiosum may jeopardize graft viability. A second major advantage is its versatility: it can be used throughout the entire anterior urethra, from the membranous area to the meatus. In addition, the circular fasciocutaneous penile flap is easily combined with other tissue-transfer techniques when necessary, enabling one-stage reconstruction in the majority of cases. The flap may be tubularized for replacement urethroplasty or divided and used in two separate stenotic areas. Onlay reconstruction is preferable to flap tubularization and has provided a better initial and long-term outcome. The circular fasciocutaneous penile flap provides superior results even in patients with complex refractory strictures in whom previous attempts at anterior urethroplasty have failed. We believe its superiority resides in the transfer of well-vascularized tissue to the compromised area.

To assess its biological function, we deleted the AIB3 gene in mice by homologous recombination. AIB3(+/-) mice are developmentally normal and fertile. AIB3(-/-) embryos exhibit growth restriction and lethality during 9.75-11.5 days postconception. The embryonic lethality is probably attributed to defects in the development of the placental vascular network and cardiac hypoplasia. These defects include the failure of labyrinthine development, the dilation of maternal blood sinuses, the massive erythrophagocytosis by trophoblasts, the alteration of trophoblast populations, and the lower proliferation of myocardium, which are similar to those encountered in mice lacking PPARgamma or the PPARgamma-binding protein (PBP, TRAP220, or DRIP205). In addition, the transcriptional activities of PPARgamma are significantly affected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking AIB3. These results suggest that AIB3 is required for PPARgamma function in placental development and for normal heart development.

Here we report that the lethality of c-myc(-/-) embryos is also associated with profound defects in vasculogenesis and primitive erythropoiesis. Furthermore, c-myc(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) and yolk sac cells are compromised in their differentiative and growth potential. These defects are intrinsic to c-Myc, and are in part associated with a requirement for c-Myc for the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as VEGF can partially rescue these defects. However, c-Myc is also required for the proper expression of other angiogenic factors in ES and yolk sac cells, including angiopoietin-2, and the angiogenic inhibitors thrombospondin-1 and angiopoietin-1. Finally, c-myc(-/-) ES cells are dramatically impaired in their ability to form tumors in immune-compromised mice, and the small tumors that sometimes develop are poorly vascularized. Therefore, c-Myc function is also necessary for the angiogenic switch that is indispensable for the progression and metastasis of tumors.

These structures were resolved in the electron microscope to be made up of 12-nm-wide microfibrils in the vicinity of the surface of the cells of the root sheath. In the process of development, these dot-like structures elongated into entities with helical appearances. As the development further proceeded, longer oxytalan fibers were produced in the apico-occlusal direction along with blood vessels. Quantitative analysis showed that an increase in oxytalan fibers coincided with an increase in the density of the vascular network in the developing periodontal ligament.

However, dysfunction of the facial nerve secondary to its translocation, conductive hearing loss, and dental malocclusion because of mandibular head resection or dislocation are significant limitations associated with some of these approaches. Although facial nerve translocation and extended maxillotomy approaches avoid some of these drawbacks, they are invasive and require extensive osteotomies and facial incisions. To avoid these potential complications and maintain an extranasal/extraoral exposure, we studied the use of a lateral and posterior extension of an anterior transmaxillary approach to the cavernous sinus.\nThe study was performed on 12 cadaver specimens and two dry skulls. An initial nasolabial fold incision, followed by an en bloc osteotomy of the anterior and lateral maxilla provides a window into the medial ITF. After osteotomy of the pterygoid plate and the posterior maxillary wall, the floor of the middle fossa is exposed to reveal the mandibular and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve exiting their respective foramina. The floor of the middle fossa is then drilled postero-medial to the foramen ovale to gain access to the course of the C3-C4 portion of the petrous carotid artery and the eustachian tube. The upper two-thirds of the clivus and the pituitary gland are accessed after drilling of the floor of the sella turcica and form the posterior limit of this exposure.\nThe technique offers a trajectory to the medial ITF and skull base that does not necessitate palatal splitting or opening of the nasopharynx. The anterior route avoids temporomandibular joint disruption, and spares the lacrimal apparatus and all branches of the facial nerve. In addition, the reflected pterygoid muscle can be used as a vascularized flap for closure of the skull base defect.\nThe approach may be an alternative less invasive approach to the ITF and may be suitable for ITF lesions that have minimal lateral or intracranial extension.", "journal": "Surgical neurology", "date": "2002-10-04", "authors": ["IbrahimSabit", "Steven DSchaefer", "William TCouldwell"], "doi": "10.1016/s0090-3019(02)00764-4"}
{"title": "Monitoring flap for buried free tissue transfer: its importance and reliability.", "abstract": "To improve the success rate of microsurgical flap transfers into a buried area, it is important to monitor the circulation of the flap during the early stage. A monitoring flap includes such advantages as simplicity, reliability, noninvasiveness, and the ability to continuously monitor the vascular status of various buried flaps. This article describes experiences related to the importance and reliability of a monitoring flap. A total of 109 flaps in 99 patients were treated with buried free flaps, including a monitoring flap, between 1990 and 1999. Forty-nine patients received a tubed free radial forearm flap with a skin-monitoring flap, and six received a free jejunal flap with a jejunal segment monitoring flap for the reconstruction of the esophagus. Vascularized fibular grafts with a skin monitoring flap or peroneus longus muscle monitoring flap were used for reconstructing the mandible in six patients and for treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head in 48 flaps in 38 patients. Monitoring flap abnormalities were indicated in 14 flaps; therefore, immediate revisions were performed on the pedicle of the monitoring flap and microanastomosis site. Among these 14 flaps, nine showed true thrombosis and five showed false-positive thrombosis. Among the nine flaps that showed true thrombosis, five were salvaged and four were finally lost. The false-positive thrombosis in the five flaps was attributed to torsion or tension of the perforator of the monitoring flap in three flaps, an unclear determination in one flap because the monitoring flap size was too small, and damage to the perforator in the last flap. The total thrombosis rate was 8.3 percent (nine of 109), and the failure rate of the free tissue transfer was 3.7 percent (four of 109). The overall sensitivity of the monitoring flap was 100 percent, the predictive value of a positive test was 64 percent (nine of 14), and false-positive results occurred in 36 percent (five of 14). The salvage rate was 55.6 percent. To improve the reliability of a monitoring flap, it is recommended that the size of the flap be larger than 1 x 2 cm to assess the arterial status, and that a perforator with the appropriate caliber be selected. When a monitoring flap is fixed to a previous incision line or a newly created wound, any torsion or tension of the perforator should be avoided. In conclusion, the current results suggest that a monitoring flap is a simple, extremely useful, and reliable method for assessing the vascular status of a buried free flap.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-10-03", "authors": ["Byung ChaeCho", "Dong PillShin", "Jin SukByun", "Jae WooPark", "Bong SooBaik"], "doi": "10.1097/01.PRS.0000025286.03909.72"}
{"title": "Numerical studies on the effect of lowering temperature on the oxygen transport during brain hypothermia resuscitation.", "abstract": "There have been arguments about the advantage and shortcoming of hypothermia on the brain resuscitation during circulation arrest. People usually accepted that hypothermia may decrease the cerebral oxygen demands, which is beneficial for the patient to sustain longer time when subjected to a hypoxia. However, there are also quite a few disputes claiming that the blood viscosity would increase with the reduction of temperature, which may lead to an increase of cerebral vascular resistance and thus worsen the hypoxia state. To resolve this critical issue, a heat transfer model was established to characterize the thermal response of brain tissue during hypothermia resuscitation. Combined with this model, a compartmental model taking account of the temperature effect was further developed to analyze the transient oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)) distribution over the successive branches of the vascular network during circulation arrest. Using the morphological and physiological data of a sheep brain, effects of lowering temperature on the oxygen consumption dynamics were studied. Calculations indicated that the lower the temperature, the slower the decreasing rate for the PO(2). Although immediately lowering the brain temperature may induce an evident increase in blood viscosity and subsequently a decrease in blood flow rate, which is responsible for oxygen delivery, it seems to always result in a monotonic increase of PO(2). The results show a good qualitative accord with the experimental data. They also present better understanding on the transient oxygen transport in brain hypothermia during circulation arrest.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2002-10-03", "authors": ["YanJi", "JingLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/s0010-4825(02)00030-6"}

VEGF is elevated in astrocytomas under normal oxygen conditions and undergoes induction in hypoxic stress. Prior studies have shown that both the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-kinase) and MEK1/2 (MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2) pathways promote proliferation of astrocytoma cells and growth of astrocytic tumors. Whether these pathways regulate growth by modulating angiogenesis as well as proliferation is not clear. In this study, pharmacologic inhibitors were used to specifically inhibit PI3-kinase and MEK1/2 activity in human malignant astrocytoma cell lines, and their effects on VEGF expression were determined. Northern blot analysis of VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) from cells treated with inhibitors demonstrated cell line-specific responses. The PI3-kinase pathway regulated both the normoxic expression and hypoxic induction of VEGF in 2 cell lines, whereas MEK1/2 regulated only the normoxic expression in the same 2 lines. The third cell line showed no change in VEGF mRNA with inhibition of either of these 2 pathways. This study suggests that modulation of signaling pathways implicated in proliferation of astrocytoma cell lines may have varying effects in vivo depending on the role these pathways play in regulating tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "Neuro-oncology", "date": "2002-10-03", "authors": ["Stacy AWoods", "C JaneMcGlade", "AbhijitGuha"], "doi": "10.1093/neuonc/4.4.242"}

We hypothesize that survival and functional and electrical integration of grafts may be improved by engineering cardiac tissue constructs in vitro before grafting.\nEngineered heart tissue (EHT) was reconstituted by mixing cardiac myocytes from neonatal Fischer 344 rats with liquid collagen type I, matrigel, and serum-containing culture medium. EHTs were designed in circular shape (inner/outer diameter: 8/10 mm; thickness: 1 mm) to fit around the circumference of hearts from syngenic rats. After 12 days in culture and before implantation on uninjured hearts, contractile function of EHT was measured under isometric conditions. Baseline twitch tension amounted to 0.34+/-0.03 mN (n=33) and was stimulated by Ca(2+) and isoprenaline to 200+/-12 and 185+/-10% of baseline values, respectively. Despite utilization of a syngenic model immunosuppression (mg/kg BW: azathioprine 2, cyclosporine A 5, methylprednisolone 2) was necessary for EHT survival in vivo. Echocardiography conducted 7, 14, and 28 days after implantation demonstrated no change in left ventricular function compared with pre-OP values (n=9). Fourteen days after implantation, EHTs were heavily vascularized and retained a well organized heart muscle structure as indicated by immunolabeling of actinin, connexin 43, and cadherins. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that implanted EHTs surpassed the degree of differentiation reached before implantation.

{"title": "The antitumoral effect of endostatin and angiostatin is associated with a down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor cells.", "abstract": "Endostatin and angiostatin are known as tumor-derived angiogenesis inhibitors, but their mechanisms of action are not yet completely defined. We report here that endostatin and angiostatin, delivered by adenoviral vectors, reduced in vitro the neovessel formation in the mouse aortic ring assay by 85 and 40%, respectively. We also demonstrated in vivo that both endostatin and angiostatin inhibited local invasion and tumor vascularization of transplanted murine malignant keratinocytes, and reduced by 50 and 90% the development of highly vascularized murine mammary tumors. This inhibition of tumor growth was associated with a reduction of tumor vascularization. Expression analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) carried out in the mouse aortic ring model revealed a 3- to 10-fold down-regulation of VEGF mRNA expression in endostatin-treated rings. A similar down-regulation of VEGF expression at both mRNA and protein levels was also observed in the two in vivo cancer models after treatment with each angiogenesis inhibitor. This suggests that endostatin and angiostatin effects may be mediated, at least in part, by their ability to down-regulate VEGF expression within the tumor.

{"title": "Targeting of glycosaminoglycan-cytokine interactions as a novel therapeutic approach in allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are heteropolysaccharides present as integral components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cell and basement membranes. GAGs play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses because of their ability to interact with cytokines and chemokines, promoting the localization of these molecules onto the ECM or cell membranes at specific anatomical sites. The main goal of these studies was to test the hypothesis that interference with the binding of cytokines/chemokines to GAGs will interfere with a graft rejection response.\nMC-2, a cationic peptide derived from the sequence of the heparin-binding domain of mouse interferon gamma, was used as an inhibitor of the binding of cytokines/chemokines to GAGs. The effects of this peptide were studied in an allogeneic transplantation model involving vascularized rat skin flaps.\nThe MC-2 peptide was found to inhibit binding of interferon-gamma, as well as that of the chemokines, interleukin-8, interferon gamma inducible protein-10, and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), to GAGs in vitro. Direct administration of MC-2 in an allogeneic skin flap transplantation model resulted in a significantly delayed time of rejection, from 5.4 +/- 0.5 days (control; n=6) to 12.6 +/- 1.6 days (treated animals; n=10). Histopathologic analysis of the skin biopsies was consistent with the delayed rejection process in those animals receiving the peptide, showing only mild signs of rejection up to day 11 (in contrast, all control animals had rejected their flaps by day 6).\nThese results are consistent with the idea that GAG-cytokine interactions constitute valid therapeutic targets and suggest the potential applicability of such an approach in the prevention of graft rejection.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2002-09-28", "authors": ["RafaelFernandez-Botran", "VijayGorantla", "XichunSun", "XiaopingRen", "GustavoPerez-Abadia", "Fabian ACrespo", "RobertOliver", "Haldun IOrhun", "Edwin EQuan", "ClaudioMaldonado", "MukundaRay", "John HBarker"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200209150-00007"}

The lactate/pyruvate ratios were determined in the dialysates as a measure of the degree of anaerobic metabolism in the islet grafts. Lactate/pyruvate ratios were between 50 and 100 in grafts of both nondiabetic and diabetic recipients, and they almost doubled in response to the intravenous glucose challenge in the grafts of nondiabetic recipients. In comparison, lactate/pyruvate ratios were approximately 12 in the medium of cultured islets incubated at low glucose (5.6 mmol/L) or high glucose (16.7 mmol/L) concentrations.\nThe microdialysis technique has proven to be a valuable tool for evaluating the internal environment of islet transplants.

Next to conventional techniques, open and laparoscopic tension-free methods using mesh implants to reinforce the abdominal wall are increasingly carried out, even becoming the standard procedure in many countries. Because of the benefits of material-reduced meshes for incisional hernia repair, a new mesh modification for tension-free inguinal hernia repair has been developed. In the present study this new low-weight mesh (Vypro II) made of polypropylene and polyglactin multifilaments was compared to a common heavy-weight polypropylene mesh (Prolene) regarding their functional consequences and the morphologic tissue response. After implantation in rats as an inlay, abdominal wall mobility was recorded by three-dimensional photogrammetry and the tensile strength of the suture zone and the mesh itself was measured at 3, 21, and 90 days. Explanted tissue samples have been investigated for their histologic reaction in regard to the inflammatory infiltrate, vascularization, and connective and fat tissue ingrowth. Numbers of granulocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and foreign giant body cells have been evaluated to reflect the quality of the tissue response. The cellular response was assessed by measuring DNA strand breaks and apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferation (Ki67), and cell stress (HSP70). The results indicated that restriction of abdominal wall mobility was significantly reduced with Vypro II compared to that seen with heavy-weight mesh modification, and the inflammatory reaction and connective tissue formation were markedly diminished. Apoptosis and cell proliferation showed considerably lowered levels, and expression of cytoprotective HSP70 was significantly increased. The present study thus confirms the benefits of material-reduced mesh modifications.

To better understand this phenomenon, porous polyurethane scaffolds were produced by a variation of the phase inversion/porogen extraction technique in which a prepacked column of spherical porogen particles was infiltrated with a polymer solution before polymer precipitation and porogen extraction. Scaffolds contained pores of well defined shape (approaching open faced pentagonal dodecahedra), narrow size distributions (66.1 +/- 1.3 microm, 84.2 +/- 1.7 microm, and 156.9 +/- 1.2 microm) and high interconnectivity (interconnecting windows of 30.1 +/- 0.8 microm, 41.9 +/- 1.5 microm, and 76.4 +/- 2.0 microm, respectively). A high degree of accessible macroporosity (>80%) could be achieved while limiting the mostly inaccessible microporosity to below 2%. The neovascularization and inflammatory responses to the scaffolds were evaluated in the subcutaneous rat model for 4 weeks. The inflammatory response index and foreign body giant cell index could be reduced by 56% (p < 0.05) and 21% (p < 0.02), respectively, when the pore size was increased from 66 microm to 157 microm, whereas the vascularization index and arteriolar index remained unchanged.

In contrast to the melanomas, the gliomas induced an almost normal vascular tree with arterial and venous vessels. The arterial vessels express the arterial EC marker ephrin-B2, and possess a media of smooth muscle alpha-actin (alphaSMA)-positive cells. Venular vessels in the gliomas are ephrin-B2-negative/alphaSMA-positive.

As part of a strategy to identify all genes expressed in human EC, a full-length cDNA encoding a potential secreted protein harboring 10 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and one CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus (termed, SCUBE1 for Signal peptide-CUB-EGF-like domain containing protein 1) was identified. SCUBE1 shares homology with several protein families, including members of the fibrillin and Notch families, and the anticoagulant proteins, thrombomodulin and protein C. SCUBE1 mRNA is found in several highly vascularized tissues such as liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and brain and is selectively expressed in EC by in situ hybridization. SCUBE1 is a secreted glycoprotein that can form oligomers and manifests a stable association with the cell surface. A second gene encoding a homologue (designated SCUBE2) was also identified and is expressed in EC as well as other cell types. SCUBE2 is also a cell-surface protein and can form a heteromeric complex with SCUBE1. Both SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 are rapidly down-regulated in EC after interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment in vitro and after lipopolysaccharide injection in vivo.

The present study examined whether this unusual pattern is limited to heart grafts in this strain combination, and defined the relative importance of the donor cell H-2(d) haplotype for third-party cardiac allograft acceptance. C3H neonates were injected with (C3HxBALB)F1 bone marrow and spleen cells. Tolerance was assessed at age 8-10 weeks by transplantation of heart or skin allografts from several donor strains, and by in vitro assays of proliferation and cytotoxicity. Additionally, cells from H-2(d) and H-2(b)-expressing strains on BALB or non-BALB minor histocompatibility (miH) antigen backgrounds were tested as tolerizing inocula. Prolonged survival of cardiac grafts from all donor strains was observed in neonatally treated mice, whereas skin grafting and in vitro assays demonstrated donor-specific hyporesponsiveness. Both H-2(d) haplotype and non-H-2 miH background of graft donor and tolerizing cell donor were important to third-party cardiac allograft acceptance.

{"title": "Disruption of anterior segment development by TGF-beta1 overexpression in the eyes of transgenic mice.", "abstract": "Previous experiments showed that transgenic mice expressing a secreted self-activating transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta1 did not show a phenotype in the lens and cornea until postnatal day 21, when anterior subcapsular cataracts, sporadic thickening of the corneal stroma, and thinning of the corneal epithelium were noted (Srinivasan et al., 1998). To examine the effects of higher concentrations of TGF-beta1 on the lens and cornea, we constructed transgenic mice harboring the strong, lens-specific chicken betaB1-crystallin promoter driving an activated porcine TGF-beta1 gene. In contrast to the earlier study, the transgenic mice had microphthalmic eyes with closed eyelids. Already at embryonic day (E) 13.5, the future cornea of the transgenic mice was threefold thicker than that of wild-type littermates due to increased proliferation of corneal stromal mesenchyme cells. Staining of fibronectin and thrombospondin-1 was increased in periocular mesenchyme. At E17.5, the thickened transgenic corneal stroma was vascularized and densely populated by abundant star-shaped, neural cell adhesion molecule-positive cells of mesenchymal appearance surrounded by irregular swirls of collagen and extracellular matrix. The corneal endothelium, anterior chamber, and stroma of iris/ciliary body did not develop, and the transgenic cornea was opaque. Fibronectin, perlecan, and thrombospondin-1 were elevated, whereas type VI collagen decreased in the transgenic corneal stroma. Stromal mesenchyme cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin as did lens epithelial cells and cells of the retinal pigmented epithelium. By E17.5, lens fiber cells underwent apoptotic cell death that was followed by apoptosis of the entire anterior lens epithelium between E18.5 and birth. Posteriorly, the vitreous humor was essentially absent; however, the retina appeared relatively normal. Thus, excess TGF-beta1, a mitogen for embryonic corneal mesenchyme, severely disrupts corneal and lens differentiation.

However, the regulation of VEG/PF synthesis by particular cell types of the endometrium during the human menstrual cycle is not well understood. Therefore, in the present study the baboon was used as a nonhuman primate to determine the role of the ovary in vivo in endometrial VEG/PF expression. VEG/PF mRNA levels were quantified by competitive RT-PCR in whole uterine endometrium and in glandular epithelial and stromal cells isolated from the endometrium by laser capture microdissection of baboons during the normal menstrual cycle and after ovariectomy, which decreased serum estradiol and progesterone to undetectable levels. Mean (+/-SE) levels (attomoles per micrograms of total RNA) of the 323-bp VEG/PF mRNA product, which reflected collective expression of all VEG/PF isoforms, in whole endometrium were 785 and 727 +/- 158 during the mid and late follicular phases, respectively, and 1108 +/- 320 during the midcycle surge in serum estradiol. VEG/PF mRNA levels then declined briefly before increasing to 1029 +/- 365 attomoles/ micro g RNA during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. VEG/PF mRNA levels (attomoles per femtomole of 18S rRNA) were similar in glandular epithelial (2.27 +/- 1.11) and stromal (2.54 +/- 0.70) cells at the midcycle estradiol peak and the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle (2.34 +/- 1.30 and 1.49 +/- 0.53, respectively). Immunocytochemical expression of VEG/PF protein was abundant in glandular and luminal epithelium, stroma, and vascular endothelium. Endometrial vessel density and percent vascularized area, determined by morphometric image analysis, were similar during the various stages of the baboon menstrual cycle. After ovariectomy, VEG/PF mRNA levels (attomoles per femtomole of 18S rRNA) in the endometrial glands (0.52 +/- 0.21) and stroma (0.22 +/- 0.11) were decreased to values that were approximately 20% and 10% (P < 0.05), respectively, of those in intact baboons during the midcycle estrogen surge. Moreover, there was relatively little VEG/PF protein immunostaining in the endometrial glands, stroma, and vascular endothelium after ovariectomy. In summary, VEG/PF mRNA and protein expression in glandular epithelial and stromal cells were markedly suppressed after ovariectomy, indicating that synthesis of this angiogenic factor in these endometrial cells is dependent upon a product(s) secreted by the ovary. Moreover, endometrial VEG/PF expression remained relatively constant and thus was available as a component of the angiogenic system throughout the menstrual cycle, presumably to progressively promote vascular reconstruction of the endometrium.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2002-09-20", "authors": ["Andrea LNiklaus", "Jeffery SBabischkin", "Graham WAberdeen", "Gerald JPepe", "Eugene DAlbrecht"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2002-220385"}

We initiated an unbiased global search for transcriptional changes occurring during endothelial cell vascular differentiation in vitro, focusing on genes not previously implicated in vascularization and angiogenesis.\ncDNA and protein from human umbilical vein endothelial cells forming vascular tubes on the basement membrane surrogate, Matrigel, were collected and subjected to a global unbiased search for alterations in expression of genes not previously linked to angiogenesis.\nTranscriptional inhibitors blocked vascular tube formation only when present within the first hour of incubation (P < 0.05). cDNA array analysis yielded 31 differentially regulated transcripts (of 5100 queried; false positive rate, 0.4%) from gene classes representing transcription, translational regulation, cell structure, and cell adhesion. mRNA levels of caldesmon, a cytoskeleton-associated protein not previously linked to angiogenesis, were markedly reduced during early tube formation. Caldesmon protein quantity was also markedly decreased as demonstrated by laser capture microdissection of tubule cells followed by immunoblotting. Strikingly, no significant changes in transcription of genes previously demonstrated to contribute to angiogenesis, invasion, or signal transduction contained on the array were observed. To investigate the possibility that posttranslational rather than transcriptional changes were involved in facilitating tube formation, we evaluated the activation status of two dominant signal pathways, RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT. A net 3-fold reduction in phospho-AKT and a 4-fold reduction in phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 occurred in a transcription-independent fashion.\nThese data suggest that both changes in gene expression and transcription-independent activation of signal transduction pathways may be involved in vascular tube formation.

Interleukin-18 has been shown to have similar bioactivities to interleukin-12 and to have antitumor efficacy in experimental models. In this study, we investigated whether the introduction of the interleukin-18 gene to B16F10 melanoma cells can induce antitumor response or not. Before the transfection, we modified the interleukin-18 gene to enable transfected tumor cells to secrete bioactive interleukin-18, because interleukin-18 does not have a signal sequence and requires processing by the interleukin-1 converting enzyme to attain the mature form. We found that B16 melanoma cells transduced with hybrid cDNA consisting of the interferon-beta signal sequence and mature interleukin-18 sequence, but not native interleukin-18, secreted a large amount of interleukin-18 and exhibited retarded tumor growth when injected in syngeneic mice. The antitumor effect was mostly abrogated by administration of anti-interferon-gamma antibody, but was not affected by in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells or natural killer cells. Histologic analysis revealed that vascularization was markedly reduced and that necrosis was extensively induced in interleukin-18-secreting B16F10 melanoma (B16/IL18) tissues, whereas abundant tumor vessel formation was observed in B16/IL18 tissues of interferon-gamma-neutralized mice. We also found that chemokines, interferon-inducible protein-10 and monokine induced by interferon-gamma, were produced in B16/IL18 tissues and that the expression of both chemokines was dependent on that of interferon-gamma in the tumor tissues. Further, we showed that B16 melanoma cells secreted both chemokines in response to interferon-gamma. In addition, the expression of angiogenin, an angiogenic factor of melanoma, in B16 melanoma cells was reduced by interferon-gamma treatment. These results indicate that gene transfer of secreted-type interleukin-18 to B16F10 melanoma cells is a useful method of triggering an antitumor response without any systemic adverse effects and that the antitumor efficacy is mainly mediated by antiangiogenic activity, which is possibly involved in at least two dynamic changes induced by interferon-gamma inside B16 melanoma cells: the upregulation of antiangiogenic chemokines, interferon-inducible protein-10 and monokine induced by interferon-gamma, and the downregulation of angiogenic factor, angiogenin.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2002-09-17", "authors": ["HiroshiNagai", "IsaoHara", "TatsuyaHorikawa", "MasahiroOka", "SadaoKamidono", "MasamitsuIchihashi"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1523-1747.2002.01866.x"}

The presence of poorly vascularized tissues, the adherence to bone structures and implants, and a slow bacterial replication rate are recognized as important factors for the persistence of the infection. Treatment of osteomyelitis is particularly challenging and involves adequate antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement of all necrotic bone and soft tissues.

Even in experienced neurovascular centers the clinical outcome varies considerably. Within a series of 1386 aneurysm patients 72 (5%) giant (>25 mm) aneurysms were treated in our institution. Their age ranged between 26 and 81 years (medium age 52 years). 22 patients were suffering of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Additionally there were 50 patients with nerve palsies or unspecific symptoms due to unruptured giant aneurysms (UGA). Treatment modalities included surgical clipping (n = 35), balloon occlusion of the ICA (n = 12), endovascular coiling (n = 7) or a combined regimen of balloon occlusion, surgical clipping and EC-IC bypass (n = 8). 10 patients could not be treated on due to their high age or minor clinical status (H&H IV and V). 6 of 15 (40%) SAH-patients were discharged without any complaints compared to 26% (12 of 47 patients) in the group of unruptured aneurysms. 1 SAH-patients (7%) versus 13 UGA (28%) patients suffered persisting nerve palsies or minor neurological disorders. 32% (n = 15) of the UGA-patients were suffering of major neurological deficits and required further professional help. 5 patients remained in a vegetative state, 3 of these had been admitted with an incidental finding of an UGA. 6 of 15 (40%) SAH-patients died, 5 of them admitted with H&H grade IV or V.

The clinical status and age of the patient are significant factors influencing treatment associated morbidity and mortality. The individual vascular situation may lead to a complex therapeutical regimen thereby predisposes higher complication rates. We believe that surgical clipping is the first choice of treatment allowing temporarily clipping and reconstruction of the normal anatomy by shrinking or/and reconstructive clipping while reducing the mass effect.

The objective was to evaluate the biological response of the spinal cord and nerve roots (dura mater) to PEEK polymer particles. Twenty-four female New Zealand white rabbits were used.

We show that ERK5 deficiency leads to an increased expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), dysregulation of which has been shown to impede angiogenic remodeling and vascular stabilization. Our data also reveal that ERK5 negatively regulates transcription from the vegf locus during hypoxic responses. Importantly, ERK5 is required at an earlier developmental stage than p38alpha, and p38alpha does not compensate for ERK5 deficiency.

A survey of 21 representative tissues highlighted a prevalence of V1 mRNA; demonstrated that the relative frequency of expression was V1 > V2 > V3 >or= V2; and showed that <15% of the tissues transcribed significant levels of all four isoforms. By employing novel and previously described anti-versican antibodies we verified a ubiquitous versican deposition in normal and tumor-associated vascular structures and disclosed differences in the glycanation profiles of versicans produced in different vascular beds. Resting endothelial cells isolated from different tissue sources transcribed several of the versican isoforms but consistently failed to translate these mRNAs into detectable proteoglycans. However, if stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha or vascular endothelial growth factor, they altered their versican expression by de novo transcribing the V3 isoform and by exhibiting a moderate V1/V2 production. Induced versican synthesis and de novo V3 expression was also observed in endothelial cells elicited to migrate in a wound-healing model in vitro and in angiogenic endothelial cells forming tubule-like structures in Matrigel or fibrin clots. The results suggest that, independent of the degree of vascularization, human adult tissues show a limited expression of versican isoforms V0, V2, and V3 and that endothelial cells may contribute to the deposition of versican in vascular structures, but only following proper stimulation.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2002-09-11", "authors": ["SabrinaCattaruzza", "MonicaSchiappacassi", "AsaLjungberg-Rose", "PaolaSpessotto", "DanielaPerissinotto", "MatthiasM\u00f6rgelin", "Maria TeresaMucignat", "AlfonsoColombatti", "RobertoPerris"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M206521200"}

The success of these DCs for therapy of allograft rejection has been limited in part by the potential of the adenovirus to promote DC maturation and the inherent ability of the DC to undergo maturation following in vivo administration. DC maturation occurs via NF-kappaB-dependent mechanisms, which can be blocked by double-stranded \"decoy\" oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) containing binding sites for NF-kappaB.

Tbdn-1 expression in endothelial cells becomes downregulated during the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro and is regulated in vivo in a manner which suggests a functional role in dampening blood vessel development. Here we show that tbdn-1 is expressed highly in the vitreal vascular network (tunica vasculosa lentis and vasa hyaloidea propria) during the pruning and remodeling phases of this transient structure. The vitreal blood vessels of mice harboring a targeted inactivation of TGF-beta2 fail to remodel and abnormally accumulate, a phenomenon reminiscent of the ocular pathology resembling persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) in humans. Since suppression of normal tbdn-1 expression has been previously observed in retinal vessel proliferation, we analyzed vitreal vascular changes and tbdn-1 expression in TGF-beta2(-/-) eyes. The nuclei of vitreal vessel endothelial cells in TGF-beta2(-/-) eyes express proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and exhibit increased levels of active (P42/44)mitogen-activated protein kinase (phospho-(P42/44)MAPK), characteristics consistent with proliferative endothelial cells. In contrast to normal vitreal vessels, collagen IV expression exhibited a disorganized pattern in the TGF-beta2(-/-) vitreal vessels, suggesting vessel disorganization and possibly a breakdown of vessel basal laminae. Moreover, vitreal vessels of TGF-beta2(-/-) mice lack expression of pericyte markers (CD13, alpha smooth muscle actin) and show ultrastructural changes consistent with pericyte degeneration. The accumulating vitreal blood vessels of TGF-beta2(-/-) mice, while maintaining expression of the endothelial marker von Willebrand Factor, show a significant decrease in the expression of tbdn-1. We addressed the functional role of tbdn-1 in the regulation of vitreal blood vessels using an in vitro model of choroid-retina capillary outgrowth. Clones of the RF/6A fetal choroid-retina endothelial cell line showing suppression of tbdn-1 levels after overexpression of an antisense TBDN-1 cDNA display a significant increase in the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro compared with controls. These findings suggest that tbdn-1 inhibits capillary-like formation in vitro and may serve to dampen vitreal blood vessel formation preceding the regression of the vitreal vasculature during development.

{"title": "Inhibition of prostate tumor cell hyaluronan synthesis impairs subcutaneous growth and vascularization in immunocompromised mice.", "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA), a secreted glycosaminoglycan component of extracellular matrices, is critical for cellular proliferation and motility during development. However, elevated circulating and cell-associated levels correlate with various types of cancer, including prostate. We have previously shown that aggressive PC3M-LN4 prostate tumor cells synthesize excessive HA relative to less aggressive cells, and express correspondingly higher levels of the HA biosynthetic enzymes HAS2 and HAS3. Inhibition of these enzymes by stable transfection of PC3M-LN4 cells with anti-sense HAS2 or HAS3 expression constructs diminishes HA synthesis and surface retention. In this report, we used these HA-deficient cell lines to examine the role of HA in tumorigenicity. Subcutaneous injection of SCID mice with hyaluronan synthase (HAS) antisense-transfected cells produced tumors threefold to fourfold smaller than control transfectants. Tumors from HAS antisense transfectants were histologically HA-deficient relative to controls. HA deficiency corresponded to threefold reduced cell numbers per tumor, but comparable numbers of apoptotic and proliferative cells. Percentages of apoptotic cells in cultured transfectants were identical to those of control cells, but antisense inhibition of HA synthesis effected slower growth rate of cells in culture. Quantification of blood vessel density within tumor sections revealed 70 to 80% diminished vascularity of HAS antisense tumors. Collectively, the results suggest HAS overexpression by prostate tumor cells may facilitate their growth and proliferation in a complex environment by enhancing intrinsic cell growth rates and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, this is the first report of a role for inhibition of HA synthesis in reducing tumor growth kinetics.", "journal": "The American journal of pathology", "date": "2002-09-06", "authors": ["Melanie ASimpson", "Christopher MWilson", "James BMcCarthy"], "doi": "10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64245-9"}

In an attempt to elucidate their biological roles more clearly, we generated double-TSP1/TSP2-null animals and compared their phenotype to those of TSP1- and TSP2-null mice. Double-null mice exhibited an apparent phenotype that primarily represented the sum of the abnormalities observed in the single-null mice. However, surprisingly, the wound-healing response in double-null mice resembled that in TSP1-null animals and differed from that in TSP2-nulls. Thus, although the excisional wounds of TSP2-null mice are characterized by increased neovascularization and heal at an accelerated rate, TSP1-null and double-null animals demonstrated delayed healing, as indicated by the prolonged persistence of inflammation and delayed scab loss. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that, similar to TSP1-null mice, the granulation tissue of double-null mice was not excessively vascularized. Furthermore as in TSP1-nulls, decreases in macrophage recruitment and in the levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 indicated that the inflammatory phase of the wound-healing response was impaired in double-null mice. Our data demonstrate that the consequences of a lack of TSP1 predominate in the response of double-null mice, and dictate the course of wound healing.

These defects are caused in part by impaired cartilage mineralization and vascularization of the chondro-osseous junction. Blood vessel invasion of mineralized cartilage is an essential step in endochondral ossification, providing access for cells that degrade cartilage as well as those that form bone. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was shown to be a key regulator of this process when infusion of a dominant negative VEGF receptor effectively blocked vascular invasion and endochondral ossification in the growth plates of juvenile mice. Here, we show that the active metabolite of vitamin D 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3] directly stimulates transcription of mRNAs encoding VEGF121 and -165 isoforms in the CFK2 chondrogenic cell line. Enhanced VEGF expression also was evident in growth plate chondrocytes and osteoblasts in the tibia of juvenile mice treated systemically with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. This was seen in conjunction with enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, which activates VEGF stored in the cartilage matrix, in osteoclastic cells adjacent to the chondro-osseous junction. The alterations in VEGF and MMP-9 expression were accompanied by enhanced vascular invasion of mineralized cartilage, as assessed by CD31 immunoreactivity. These results provide evidence that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 signaling stimulates VEGF and MMP-9 gene expression and promotes neovascularization of the epiphyseal growth plate in vivo through increased availability of active growth factor.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2002-09-05", "authors": ["RobertoLin", "NorioAmizuka", "TomoyoSasaki", "Michelle MAarts", "HideharoOzawa", "DavidGoltzman", "Janet EHenderson", "John HWhite"], "doi": "10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.9.1604"}

The attachment of heparan sulfate (HS) to these matrices may promote the binding, modulation, and sustained release of signaling molecules. In this study, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was bound to crosslinked collagenous matrices with and without covalently attached HS. The tissue response to these matrices was evaluated after subcutaneous implantation in rats. Attachment of HS to collagen matrices increased the bFGF binding capacity threefold and resulted in a more gradual and sustained release of the growth factor in vitro. bFGF primarily was located at the matrix margins. In vivo, the presence of HS without bFGF resulted in a transient vascularization, predominantly at the matrix periphery. Angiogenesis was further enhanced by combining HS with bFGF. In contrast to collagen-HS and collagen/bFGF matrices, collagen-HS/bFGF matrices remained highly vascularized throughout the matrix during the 10-week implantation period. In addition, these latter matrices revealed an intense and prolonged tissue response and considerably promoted the generation of new tissue.

The tissue response to preformed lactic acid networks implanted in rats consisted of a mild inflammatory response with an increase in fibrous capsule thickness and inflammation correlating with faster degrading polymer compositions. This relatively neutral response is indicative of a biocompatible, degradable polymer that has potential medical applications. Finally, porous scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in rats, and vascularized fibrous tissue infiltration was highly dependent on the scaffold porosity and architecture.

All of the specimens are preserved by calcareous cellular permineralization and are quite similar to seed cones described as several species of Cycadeoidea and Bennettites. These cones, described as Cycadeoidea maccafferyi sp. nov., consist of tightly packed interseminal scales and ovulate sporophylls with terminal ovules. Two specimens also preserve remains of a small receptacle. Interseminal scales and ovulate sporophylls are oriented parallel to one another. Ovules are distinctly stellate at the base of the micropylar tube, and the sarcotesta consists of both longitudinally oriented tubular cells and large radially elongated cells attached to the sclerotesta. The vascular strand below each ovule is highly contorted in a pattern that is characteristic of contractile tissue in the roots of living plants. These specimens are the most recent anatomically preserved cycadeoid cones yet discovered, revealing details of the reproductive biology shortly before extinction of the clade. Superb preservation of the British Columbia cones confirms that Bennettitales lack a cupule, have radial seeds, and have a vascularized nucellus (but no integumentary tracheids), and that no pollen chamber is produced.

We therefore hypothesized that tolerance to nutrient deprivation as well as angiogenesis may be critical in some malignancies, including pancreatic cancers, which are seen to be a hypovascular tumor. In this study, we assessed the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a major role in protecting cells from metabolic stresses, on tumor biology under nutrient-deprived condition. Whereas hepatic cancer cells had mostly died within 48 h during glucose deprivation, most pancreatic cancer cells survived more than 48 h. The tolerance to glucose deprivation tended to correlate with the cells level of expression of AMPK alpha1 and alpha2. The introduction of AMPK antisense RNA expression vectors into pancreas cancer cell lines, PANC-1 and AsPC-1, significantly diminished their tolerance to glucose deprivation, and the stable transfection of AMPK antisense into PANC-1 cells inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. These findings indicate that AMPK expression contributes to tolerance to nutrient starvation in cancer cells.

An attempt was made to relate the treatment concentrations to the actual field application levels. Mortality appeared higher in most groups exposed on day 11 than on day 4, suggesting that on day 11 the extensive chorioallantoic vascular network permitted greater uptake of chemical. Only 24-60% of the embryos survived to hatch at exposure concentrations of 202, 269, and 454 g/L PC when treated on incubation day 11. At higher concentrations including 681956, and 1211 g/L PC, the compound did not completely dissolve in water and clumped on eggshells, resulting in greater hatching success. Exposures to SE at 100 g/L on incubation day 11 did not significantly affect hatching success of embryos but did significantly reduce the percent hematocrit in blood compared with controls. Incubation day 11 exposure to 202 and 1211 g/L PC led to a significant increase in plasma aspartate aminotransferase, and day 4 exposure to 1211 g/L PC resulted in a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase. In addition to elevated liver enzymes, these treatments resulted in a decrease in the number of hepatocyte profiles (1211 g/L PC at day 4 and day 11) and an increase in hepatocyte size (202 and 1211 g/L PC at day 11) in hatchlings. A combination of SE and PC was synergistic (202 g/L PC and 50 g/L SE) at day 11 of incubation with respect to decreased hatching success and reduced bone lengths. However, lower concentrations of SE (10 g/L or 30 g/L) combined with 202 g/L of PC appeared antagonistic. This may be due to SE, as a surfactant, altering the ability of PC to penetrate the egg.

Pigmentation is determined by the activity of tyrosinase (TYR), the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase activity can be modulated at the genetic and/or epigenetic level. In this commentary I suggest that pigmentation can serve as an indicator for genetic and metabolic changes as follows. In TYR-negative, amelanotic melanomas cells, downregulation of TYR and other melanocyte-specific gene expression is likely to be mediated by dominantly acting oncogenes with impact on the transcriptional activity of the melanocyte-specific transcription factor Mitf. Ras and c-myc, shown to be active and upregulated in subclasses of melanoma tumors, have the potential to induce these changes. TYR-positive highly pigmented melanoma tumors are likely to reside in aerobic, well-vascularized microenvironment. In contrast, hypo- or amelanotic TYR-positive lesions suffer from reduced TYR activity due to an acidified microenvironment. These lesions might have encountered anaerobic conditions, and have adapted to the reduced oxygen by enhanced glycolysis, leading to extracellular acidification and activation of V-ATPase.", "journal": "Oncology research", "date": "2002-08-31", "authors": ["RuthHalaban"], "doi": "10.3727/096504002108747908"}

Vessel co-option, the use of pre-existent vessels, was described first in the brain, one of the most densely vascularized organs in the body. Thus, brain tumors may develop without the need of an angiogenic switch to occur. Obviously, this way of blood supply will not be affected by angiogenesis inhibition. In addition, it is predicted that tumors with this type of behavior will be less visible in contrast-enhanced MRI.

{"title": "[Ultrasound diagnosis of focal intrauterine lesions].", "abstract": "To compare the efficacy of the conventional grey-scale real time ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound (color flow mapping) and hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of circumscript intrauterine lesions, such as endometrial polyps and submucosal myomas.\nPreoperative transvaginal ultrasound data of 124 patients with focal intrauterine lesions, as confirmed by operative hysteroscopy, were elaborated. Using grey-scale ultrasound the detailed endometrial morphology, with color Doppler the vascularization pattern of the endometrium was examined. The ultrasound diagnosis, the hysteroscopic diagnosis and the histological diagnosis were matched and the sensitivity of conventional grey-scale ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound and hysteroscopy were calculated. Age, menstrual and fertility status, medication and symptoms (abnormal bleeding) of patients were also evaluated.\nOf the 124 removed lesions the histological examination confirmed 114 endometrial polyps and 10 leiomyomas. Conventional grey-scale ultrasound was performed at 79 patients (TVS group), while 45 patient were examined by color Doppler ultrasound (TVCD group). In the TVS group the intrauterine lesion was detected in 59 cases, and the origin was also correctly diagnosed in 48 cases. In the TVCD group 42 lesions were detected, and the ultrasound diagnosis was consistent with the histological diagnosis in 41 cases. At hysteroscopy 118 endometrial polyps and 6 myoma were described. In this material the sensitivity of conventional transvaginal grey-scale ultrasound, the color Doppler ultrasound, and hysteroscopy in the detection of circumscript intrauterine lesions was 0.74, 0.93 and 1, respectively; in the diagnosis of the intrauterine lesion was 0.66, 0.91 and 0.97, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between the ultrasound detection rates (p < 0.05) and between the diagnosis rates (p < 0.01) of the TVS and the TVCD group. Abnormal menopausal bleeding, recurrent bleeding, infertility, and tamoxifen therapy were present with high frequency in clinical data.\nVisualization of the feeding vessels using color or power Doppler ultrasound imaging improves the detection rate and the ultrasound diagnosis of the circumscript intrauterine lesions, approaching the sensitivity of hysteroscopy.

Ten fresh cadavers were dissected after intra-arterial injection of colored resin. All the collateral vessels running to this bone were described and counted. On 25 dry bones, the vascular foramina were measured with the aid of a millimetric gauge and a vascular map was created. The posterior part of the ilium appears to be twice as well vascularized as the anterior part. Fractures of the posterior arch of the pelvis are theoretically more hemorrhagic. The presence of the iliolumbar artery in contact with the sacroiliac joint increases the risk with open book or shearing fractures. The artery of the ischium, a collateral of the pudendal artery, supplies the posterior and lateral parts of the acetabulum and the artery of the roof of the acetabulum, its superior and lateral parts. The branches of the anterior and posterior divisions of the obturator artery supply the superior part of the surroundings of the obturator foramen and the antero-inferior and postero-inferior parts of the acetabulum. The Kocher approach may injure the artery of the ischium. Letournel's extended lateral approach and Mears' triradiate approach may injure the artery of the ischium and the artery of the roof of the acetabulum. The risk of osteonecrosis appears to be theoretically increased if one adds an endopelvic approach. The anterior approach to the acetabulum appears to be that which theoretically leads to the least devascularization.

Some authors believe that injury to these arteries in the greater palatine canal is intrinsic to the procedure without any consequence for the trophicity of the mucosa or bony palate. In order to assess the risk of injury to the descending palatine arteries during such surgery, and to demonstrate the supplementary vascularization which would avoid ischemia of the palate, we carried out a study of the vascularization of the palate on 11 fresh cadavers. We used intra-arterial injection of colored latex and dissection of the vessels running to the palate. The study was done without osteotomy in the first subject, after a Le Fort 1 osteotomy in the five following subjects and after a Le Fort 1 osteotomy and ligation of the two descending palatine arteries in the last five subjects. Our results show that injury of the descending palatine arteries is not intrinsic to the procedure in spite of mobilization of the palatine plateau. When the descending palatine arteries are ligated there is diminution in coloration of the mucosa of the bony palate but there is substitution by the arteries vascularizing the soft palate, essentially the ascending palatine artery and the pharyngeal branch arising from the ascending pharyngeal artery.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic relevance of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway activation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). COX-2 activity was analyzed in 52 consecutive patients by assessing protein expression and prostaglandin E(2) (PgE(2)) levels and was then correlated to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and tumor angiogenesis. We evaluated the prognostic impact of these parameters by Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analysis. COX-2 expression by tumor cells was closely correlated to VEGF expression and to tumor vascularization. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with COX-2 tumor overexpression and with higher PgE(2) tumor levels had significantly shorter overall survival estimates (P = 0.022 and P = 0.033, respectively). Analogously, patients with more-vascularized tumors had worse survival than those with less-vascularized cancers (P = 0.032). Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that the most significant prognostic factors were presence of lymph node metastasis, tumor vascularization, COX-2 protein expression, and PgE(2) tumor levels. This study demonstrates a close correlation between COX-2 pathway, VEGF expression, and tumor angiogenesis in HNSCC.

The purpose of the current study is to determine the efficacy of this tolerance regimen in preventing acute and chronic rejection in a vascularized heart graft model and to compare this regimen with other putative tolerance protocols. Mice receiving costimulation blockade (CTLA4-Ig and anti-CD40 ligand) alone or in combination with donor cells enjoyed markedly prolonged heart graft survival and initially preserved histological structure. However, tolerance was not achieved, as evidenced by the eventual onset of chronic rejection characterized by obliterative vasculopathy and the rejection of secondary skin grafts. In contrast, following treatment with costimulation blockade, busulfan, and bone marrow, heart grafts survived indefinitely without detectable signs of chronic rejection or structural damage, even 100 days after placement of a secondary donor skin graft. We detected multilineage chimerism in peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus, and peripheral deletion of donor-reactive cells was complete by day 90.

{"title": "Protein kinases as targets for anticancer agents: from inhibitors to useful drugs.", "abstract": "Many components of mitogenic signaling pathways in normal and neoplastic cells have been identified, including the large family of protein kinases, which function as components of signal transduction pathways, playing a central role in diverse biological processes, such as control of cell growth, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis. The development of selective protein kinase inhibitors that can block or modulate diseases caused by abnormalities in these signaling pathways is widely considered a promising approach for drug development. Because of their deregulation in human cancers, protein kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, those in the epidermal growth factor-receptor (HER) family, the cell cycle regulating kinases such as the cyclin-dependent kinases, as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor kinases involved in the neo-vascularization of tumors, are among the protein kinases considered as prime targets for the development of selective inhibitors. These drug-discovery efforts have generated inhibitors and low-molecular weight therapeutics directed against the ATP-binding site of various protein kinases that are in various stages of development (up to Phase II/III clinical trials). Three examples of inhibitors of protein kinases are reviewed, including low-molecular weight compounds targeting the cell cycle kinases; a potent and selective inhibitor of the HER1/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, the pyrollopyrimidine PKI166; and the 2-phenyl-aminopyrimidine STI571 (Glivec(R), Gleevec) a targeted drug therapy directed toward Bcr-Abl, the key player in chronic leukemia (CML). Some members of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases, in particular HER1 and HER2, have been found to be overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, suggesting that inhibition of HER signaling would be a viable antiproliferative strategy. The pyrrolo-pyrimidine PKI166 was developed as an HER1/HER2 inhibitor with potent in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo antitumor activity. Based upon its clear association with disease, the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in CML represents the ideal target to validate the clinical utility of protein kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents. In a preclinical model, STI571 (Glivec(R), Gleevec) showed potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity that was selective for Abl, c-Kit, and the platelet-derived growth factor-receptor. Phase I/II studies demonstrated that STI571 is well tolerated, and that it showed promising hematological and cytogenetic responses in CML and clinical responses in the c-Kit-driven gastrointestinal tumors.", "journal": "Pharmacology & therapeutics", "date": "2002-08-23", "authors": ["DorianoFabbro", "StephanRuetz", "ElisabethBuchdunger", "Sandra WCowan-Jacob", "GabrieleFendrich", "JanisLiebetanz", "J\u00fcrgenMestan", "TerenceO'Reilly", "PeterTraxler", "BhabatoshChaudhuri", "HeinzFretz", "J\u00fcrgZimmermann", "ThomasMeyer", "GiorgioCaravatti", "PascalFuret", "Paul WManley"], "doi": "10.1016/s0163-7258(02)00179-1"}

The tumour consisted of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in close proximity to minor salivary glands of which the tumour seemed to have its origin. This entity, although rare in the head and neck region has been documented to be very aggressive with early regional and hematogenic metastasis. Therefore it has to be distinguished from other tumours, especially from mucoepidermoid carcinomas of the salivary glands, which have a better prognosis. Adenosquamous carcinoma is considered to have poor radiosensitivity and chemotherapeutic approaches have also not been successful in the literature. In our case radical surgical therapy was performed by excision of the whole soft palate and bilateral neck dissection.

To define the contribution of lymph and blood flow to the clinical appearance of cutaneous inflammation, we studied the sheep ear after the application of oxazolone. As a model for the study of these changes, the sheep ear had several experimental advantages: 1) a simplified superficial vascular network, 2) defined lymphatic drainage, and 3) an avascular and alymphatic cartilaginous barrier. Lymph flow was continuously monitored by cannulation of the prescapular efferent lymph duct. Blood flow, as reflected by cutaneous erythema, was noninvasively measured by use of a visible-spectrum spectrophotometer. The application of the epicutaneous oxazolone resulted in increased ear thickness for >7 days. The lymph flow from the oxazolone-stimulated ear peaked between 24 and 48 h after oxazolone stimulation. Spectrophotometric evaluation indicated that the cutaneous erythema peaked 72-96 h after application of oxazolone. Corrosion casting and scanning electron microscopy of the microcirculation at 96 h after antigen stimulation demonstrated significant dilatation of the superficial vascular network.

However, a direct role for MEK1 in regulating the invasive and metastatic potential of mammary epithelial cells remains to be established. To directly address the role of constitutive MEK1 signaling in transformation, we have selected the murine mammary epithelial cell line, EpH4, as a model system. EpH4 cells expressing constitutively activated MEK1 display invasive growth in 3-dimensional collagen gels and enhanced motility, and metastatic potential in modified Boyden chamber assays. Furthermore, analysis of markers of normal epithelial morphology by immunofluorescence revealed reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and mislocalization of beta-catenin and ZO-1 away from sites of cell-cell contact. However, in contrast to expectations, these changes occurred independently of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a change seen frequently in transformed epithelial cells. Moreover, transplantation of EpH4 cells expressing constitutively activated MEK1 into the cleared mammary fat pads of immune-competent hosts rapidly produced tumors that were highly invasive, well vascularized, and readily metastasized to distant organs. Gene expression profiling was performed to identify the downstream targets of MEK1 signaling. Constitutive MEK1 induced the expression of genes involved in proliferation and of matrix metalloproteinases, which regulate invasion and metastasis. These results demonstrate that constitutively activated MEK1 brings about robust tumorigenic changes in murine mammary epithelial cells, and mediates their invasiveness and metastasis in vivo without a requirement for epithelial to mesenchymal transition.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-08-17", "authors": ["JanPinkas", "PhilipLeder"], "doi": null}

Prior to hypoglycemia, changes in the islet infiltrate led to autoreactive T cell activation and destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. If T cell activation can be inhibited before beta cell destruction is complete, islet cell rescue and regeneration can occur. Female NOD mice > 100 days old with blood glucose levels > 20 mM/l for less than 7 days were selected as 'recent onset' mice. Untreated, all of these animals would die of diabetes in < 40 days. Mice treated with anti-CD4 (GK1.5) achieved 14.3% permanent remission, while those treated with anti-CD8 (53.6.7) showed 33.3% permanent remission. Mice treated with anti-CD3 (145-2C1) also achieved 33.3% permanent remission, but 14% of these died of first dose syndrome. In mice treated with a low dose of anti-CD3 (10 microg KT3), which did not induce first dose syndrome, 50% remained in remission for > 100 days. This dose of mAb reduced insulitis but did not deplete splenic CD3 cells. When mice in remission were challenged with a vascularized pancreas isograft at 50 days, 9/22 remained normal and 13/22 had recurrent disease in both transplanted and native pancreas.

Our strategy for generating such bone tissue is as follows. First, bone tissue is induced in muscle by bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) with beta-tricalcium phosphate as a carrier to maintain its form in the muscle. Second, the induced bone in the muscle pedicle is grafted to the bone defect to maintain vascularity. In the first experiment, 50 microg of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) was inoculated into the hip abductor muscle of rabbits with beta-tricalcium phosphate under anesthesia. Five weeks after the operation, intramuscular bone formation was observed in all of the samples, and the form and size of the induced bone tissue were identical to those of the carrier. Ten weeks after the operation, the induced bone was partly absorbed. In the second experiment, 50 microg of rhBMP-2 was inoculated in the same manner as previously.

{"title": "Cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Recent progress in implantations of differentiated cardiac and non-cardiac cells as well as adult stem cells into the heart suggests that the irreversible loss of viable cardiac myocytes that occurs during myocardial infarction can be at least partly substituted. We evaluated an alternative approach by reconstituting cardiac tissue grafts in vitro and implanting them as spontaneously and coherently contracting tissues. For this purpose we have optimized a method to generate ring-shaped three-dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT) in vitro from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. When subjected to isometric force measurements in organ baths, electrically stimulated EHTs exhibit a Frank-Starling behavior, a positive inotropic response to increases in extracellular calcium, a positive inotropic and lusitropic response to isoprenaline, and a negative inotropic response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol ('accentuated antagonism'). Twitch tension under maximal calcium amounts to 1-2 mN/ mm2. Importantly, passive (resting) tension is low, yielding a ratio of active/passive tension of approximately 1.5 under basal and 14 under maximal calcium. Morphologically, EHTs represent a highly interconnected three-dimensional network of cardiac myocytes resembling loose cardiac tissue with a high fraction of binucleated cardiac myocytes, strong eosin staining and elongated centrally located nuclei. Electron microscopy demonstrated well developed sarcomeric structures, T-tubules, SR vesicles, T-tubule-SR-junctions, all types of intercellular connective structures, and a basement membrane. Thus, EHTs comprise functional and morphological properties of intact, ventricular myocardium. First implantation experiments of EHTs in the peritoneum of Fischer 344 rats showed that EHTs survived for at least 14 days, maintained a network of differentiated cardiac myocytes, and were strongly vascularized. Thus, EHTs may serve as material for a novel tissue replacement approach.", "journal": "Transplant immunology", "date": "2002-08-16", "authors": ["ThomasEschenhagen", "MichaelDidi\u00e9", "J\u00fcrgenHeubach", "UrsulaRavens", "Wolfram-HubertusZimmermann"], "doi": "10.1016/s0966-3274(02)00011-4"}

Initial attempts to block VEGF by using a humanized monoclonal antibody are beginning to show promise in human cancer patients, underscoring the importance of optimizing VEGF blockade. Previous studies have found that one of the most effective ways to block the VEGF-signaling pathway is to prevent VEGF from binding to its normal receptors by administering decoy-soluble receptors. The highest-affinity VEGF blocker described to date is a soluble decoy receptor created by fusing the first three Ig domains of VEGF receptor 1 to an Ig constant region; however, this fusion protein has very poor in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. By determining the requirements to maintain high affinity while extending in vivo half life, we were able to engineer a very potent high-affinity VEGF blocker that has markedly enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. This VEGF-Trap effectively suppresses tumor growth and vascularization in vivo, resulting in stunted and almost completely avascular tumors.

{"title": "The calpain system in human placenta.", "abstract": "The calpain system is involved in a number of human pathologies ranging from the muscular dystrophies to Alzheimer's disease. It is important, therefore, to be able to obtain and to characterize both mu-calpain and m-calpain from human tissue. Although human mu-calpain can be conveniently obtained from either erythrocytes or platelets, no readily available source of human m-calpain has been described. Human placenta extracts contain both mu-calpain and m-calpain in nearly equal proportions and in significant quantities (3-4 mg mu-calpain and 4-5 mg m-calpain/1000 g placenta tissue). Placenta also contains calpastatin that elutes off ion-exchange columns over a wide range of KCl concentrations completely masking the mu-calpain activity eluting off these columns and even partly overlapping m-calpain elution. Placenta mu-calpain requires 50-70 microM Ca2+ and placenta m-calpain requires 450-460 microM Ca2+ for half-maximal proteolytic activity. Western analysis of washed placenta tissue shows that placenta contains both mu- and m-calpain, although some of the mu-calpain in whole placenta extracts likely originates from the erythrocytes that are abundant in the highly vascularized placenta. Placenta calpastatin could not be purified with conventional methods. The most prominent form of calpastatin in Western analyses of placenta obtained as soon as possible after birth was approximately 48-51 kDa; partly purified preparations of placenta calpastatin also contained 48-51 and 70 kDa polypeptides.

{"title": "Free vascularized fibular bone grafting in the management of femoral neck nonunion in patients younger than fifty years.", "abstract": "The incidence of nonunion and osteonecrosis after femoral neck fracture has been well documented. In older patients implant arthroplasty is well established as an acceptable treatment of these problems. However, in the younger population alternatives to implant arthroplasty are favored to preserve the femoral head. Surgical treatments for nonunion of the femoral neck include osteotomy, nonvascularized bone grafting, muscle-pedicle bone grafting, and vascularized bone grafting. The purpose of this study is to examine the results of free vascularized fibular grafting as a treatment of nonunion of the femoral neck in patients younger than fifty years.\nTwenty-two consecutive patients underwent vascularized bone grafting for nonunion of the femoral neck after failed internal fixation between 1984 and 1998. The mean age of the patients was 28.7 years. There were thirteen male and nine female patients. The mean interval between internal fixation and free vascularized fibular grafting was 18.3 months. The average follow-up to date is 84.7 months (range 29 to 195 months).\nTwenty of twenty-two nonunions healed. Two patients required an additional procedure to facilitate union; one patient had iliac crest bone grafting at four months postoperatively and another underwent muscle-pedicle grafting at six months postoperatively. The average time to union for all patients was 9.9 months (range 3 to 23 months). Progression of osteonecrosis of the femoral head occurred in thirteen patients. However, successful long-term salvage of the femoral head was achieved in twenty of twenty-two patients, with an average Harris hip score of 78.9. Four patients required hardware removal or exchange for intraarticular migration with no long-term clinical sequelae.\nRates of complications, such as nonunion and osteonecrosis, after femoral neck fractures in young patients have been reported to be as high as 86 percent. Treatments such as osteotomy, muscle-pedicle bone grafting, nonvascularized bone grafting, and vascularized bone grafting have reported variable results. Based on the results reported in this study, vascularized fibular bone grafting compares favorably with a high union rate (91 percent initially, 100 percent after secondary procedures) and successful long-term salvage of the femoral head in 91 percent of the patients.

Cloning of the PLS locus revealed that the promoter trap T-DNA had inserted into a short open reading frame (ORF). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR, RNA gel blot analysis, and RNase protection assays showed that the PLS ORF is located within a short ( approximately 500 nucleotides) auxin-inducible transcript and encodes a predicted polypeptide of 36 amino acid residues. pls mutants exhibit a short-root phenotype and reduced vascularization of leaves. pls roots are hyperresponsive to exogenous cytokinins and show increased expression of the cytokinin-inducible gene ARR5/IBC6 compared with the wild type. pls seedlings also are less responsive to the growth-inhibitory effects of exogenous auxin and show reduced expression of the auxin-inducible gene IAA1 compared with the wild type. The PLS peptide-encoding region of the cDNA partially complements the pls mutation and requires the PLS ORF ATG for activity, demonstrating the functionality of the peptide-encoding ORF.

Using inbred Lewis rats, 30 female vascularized tibial bones were transplanted to syngeneic male recipients and 45 male grafts were transplanted to female recipients. Twenty-five female recipients were immunosuppressed with FK506 to prevent rejection caused by Y-chromosome related antigens. The grafts were assessed up to 24 weeks post-transplant by radiography, histology and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using both Y-chromosome and autosome gene-specific primers. The female to male isograft transplants were useful to measure low levels of repopulation with host-derived cells, while male to female transplants more accurately quantified higher levels of cellular replacement. No host-derived cells were detected in the transplanted bone before six weeks. Thereafter, the ratio of host-derived cells gradually increased.

{"title": "Management of acute and chronic open wounds: the importance of moist environment in optimal wound healing.", "abstract": "The history of wound care and management closely parallels that of military surgery which has laid down the principles and dictated the practices of wound cleansing, debridement and coverage. From a treatment standpoint, there are essentially two types of wounds: those characterized by loss of tissue and those in which no tissue has been lost. In the event of tissue loss it is critical to determine whether vital structures such as bone, tendons, nerves and vessels have been exposed. It is also important to determine the amount of soft tissue contusion and contamination. In any case primary wound healing by early closure either primarily or with the help of grafts or flaps is preferred to secondary healing and wound contraction with subsequent contractures which interfere with range of motion and function. Whether the wound is acute or chronic, essential principles of wound care must be observed in order to avoid wound sepsis and achieve rapid and optimal wound healing. - Tissues must be handled gently. - Caustic solutions capable of sterilizing the skin should never be applied to the wound. It is desirable never to put anything in the wound that cannot be tolerated comfortably in the conjunctival sac. - All devitalized tissues must be debrided either hydrodynamically, chemically, mechanically or surgically. - All dead space must be obliterated. - Exposed vital structures must be covered by well vascularized tissues. An essential part of any wound management protocol is wound dressing. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that a wound dressing may have a profound influence on healing particularly of secondary type healing, a critical feature being the extent to which such dressing restricts the evaporation of water from the wound surface.

We compared clinical outcomes in heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy who were treated either with percutaneous coronary intervention or with aggressive medical therapy alone.\nA retrospective analysis of all heart transplant recipients at our institution who underwent surveillance coronary angiography for coronary allograft vasculopathy between 1995 and 2000 was performed.

{"title": "Enhanced vascularization and survival of neural transplants with ex vivo angiogenic gene transfer.", "abstract": "Restoration of brain function by neural transplants is largely dependent upon the survival of donor neurons. Unfortunately, in both rodent models and human patients with Parkinson's disease the survival rate of transplanted neurons has been poor. We have employed a strategy to increase the availability of nutrients to the transplant by increasing the rate at which blood vessels are formed. Replication-deficient HSV-1 vectors containing the cDNA for human vascular endothelial growth factor (HSVhvegf) and the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (HSVlac) have been transduced in parallel into nonadherent neuronal aggregate cultures made of cells from embryonic day 15 rat mesencephalon. Gene expression from HSVlac was confirmed in fixed preparations by staining with X-gal. VEGF expression as determined by sandwich ELISA assay of culture supernatant was up to 322-fold higher in HSVhvegf-infected than HSVlac-infected sister cultures. This peptide was also biologically active, inducing endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral transplants into the striatum, with HSVlac on one side and HSVhvegf on the other. At defined intervals up to 8 weeks, animals were sacrificed and vibratome sections of the striatum were assessed for various parameters of cell survival and vascularization. Results demonstrate dose-dependent increases in blood vessel density within transplants transduced with HSVhvegf. These transplants were vascularized at a faster rate up to 4 weeks after transplantation. After 8 weeks, the average size of the HSVhvegf-infected transplants was twice that of controls. In particular, the survival of transplanted dopaminergic neurons increased 3.9-fold. Taken together these experiments provide convincing evidence that the rate of vascularization may be a major determinant of neuronal survival that can be manipulated by VEGF gene transduction.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2002-08-07", "authors": ["DianaCasper", "Samara JEngstrom", "Gautam RMirchandani", "AnnPidel", "DavidPalencia", "Paul HCho", "MichaelBrownlee", "DianeEdelstein", "Howard JFederoff", "William JSonstein"], "doi": null}

Likewise, living systems might often be well described by fractal algorithms. Such fractal descriptions in space and time imply that there is order in chaos, or put the other way around, chaotic dynamical systems in biology are more constrained and orderly than seen at first glance. The vascular network, the syncytium of cells, the processes of diffusion and transmembrane transport might be fractal features of the heart. These fractal features provide a basis which enables one to understand certain aspects of more global behavior such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation and perfusion heterogeneity.

The effects of different therapeutic regimens-combinations of hyperthermia, chemotherapy, and irradiation-on the expression of proteins playing a role in tumor vascularization and apoptosis were investigated. Additionally, MX-1 tumors were exposed to hypoxia to investigate changes in protein expression related to angiogenesis. This is of particular importance with respect to antiangiogenic therapies that may be combined with the treatments mentioned before. Endothelial and adhesion factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) factors, apoptosis-regulating factors, and neuronal factors were examined by immunohistochemical techniques. Concerning vascularization, the most prominent changes were seen in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which increased strongly after hypoxia. The other cytokines, adhesion and ECM molecules, were either little affected or unaffected by the therapy. At the ultrastructural level, the walls of the tumor vessels are of the sinusoidal type, possessing many fenestrations. With regard to the second focus of this investigation, apoptosis, tumor cells again exerted the strongest differences after hypoxia where c-myc was clearly enhanced, whereas the effects on p53, bcl-2, and CD95 were extremely weak or not detectable. Furthermore, the neurotransmitter somatostatin, a possible \"external\" regulator of apoptosis, did not show treatment-related changes. In summary, it was shown that 1) within the group of apoptosis-regulating proteins c-myc was particularly affected by hypoxia, indicating a possible role for an activation-induced pathway of apoptosis in this context; 2) minor changes seen after treatment combined with hyperthermia point to a more acute vascular reaction (=dilatation), causing an increase of tissue pO2 rather than angiogenesis; and 3) the concentrations of the angiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF rose strongly under hypoxia, thereby possibly exerting counterproductive effects to antiangiogenic therapy but not to thermochemotherapy or irradiation.

Fifty-eight reconstructions of the posterior mandible were performed with STFs (n=32) or VBFs (n=26) and were available for review. All patients (n=58) completed a functional outcome questionnaire containing questions about diet, oral competence, pain, trismus, speech, cosmesis, social reintegration, and return to work. Computer-assisted image analysis was performed comparing facial proportions of patients with STFs (n=10), VBFs (n=11), or unoperated controls (n=10). VBFs yielded statistically significantly superior functional scores compared to STFs in 5/12 categories. Normal scores were found for diet in 31 percent (10/32) vs. 21 percent (3/26) ( p=0.006); oral competence in 56 percent (18/32) vs. 35 percent (9/26) ( p=0.05); and speech in 47 percent (15/32) vs. 30 percent (7/26) ( p=0.026).

The Th1 cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha + interferon (IFN)-gamma derived in part from natural killer (NK) and NKgammadeltaT cells have been implicated in causing abortion via up-regulation of the novel prothrombinase fgl2 at the feto-maternal interface; Th2/3 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10, progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF), and TGF-beta2 derived from gammadeltaT cells stimulated by embryo antigens in the context of the OX-2 (CD200) tolerance signal have been viewed as counteracting the Th1 effect. These mechanisms are distinct from those causing and preventing occult pregnancy loss during the periimplantation phase of pregnancy prior to development of a vascularized placenta. Spontaneous abortions in the CBA/J x DBA/2 can be boosted by injecting TNF-alpha + IFN-gamma, but the boosted abortion rates can range from < or = 30 to > 80%, depending on the loss rate in uninjected mice, and this is not explainable by the endogenous level of these cytokines.

Thus, we addressed the possibility that 6-TG may also act as an anti-angiogenic molecule. 6-TG inhibited endothelial cell proliferation triggered by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and delayed the repair of a mechanically wounded endothelial cell monolayer. Also, 6-TG inhibited sprouting within fibrin gel, morphogenesis on Matrigel, and collagen gel invasion by endothelial cells. 2-Aminopurine was ineffective. In vivo, 6-TG inhibited basal, VEGF-induced, and FGF2-induced vascularization in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane and prevented neovascularization triggered by leukemia LIK cells or their conditioned medium. Finally, bone marrow vascularization in AML patients was decreased to control values in the early remission phase and persisted unvaried after 8-12 months of maintenance therapy with 6-TG. Thus, 6-TG inhibits different steps of the angiogenesis process in vitro and exerts a potent anti-angiogenic activity in vivo.

Pigs are now generally accepted to be the source animal of choice. Transplantation of pig organs to humans faces several barriers which have to be overcome before it comes to clinical application: (1) anatomical and physiological conditions; (2) immunological rejection mechanisms; (3) molecular compatibility between signal molecules of the two species; (4) risk of transmission of microorganisms, particularly pig endogenous retroviruses; and (5) legal and ethical aspects both with respect to the animal and the recipient. Here we will focus on the role of the complement system in the rejection of immediately vascularized pig-to-primate xenografts.

{"title": "Locoregional immunochemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma remains a disease with a poor and dismal prognosis, and all forms of currently available conventional therapies are rarely beneficial. However, in recent years, combined targeting locoregional immunochemotherapy has been reported with very promising results. Adoptive immunotherapy with LAK cells (lymphokine-activated killer cells) and recombinant interleukin-2 is becoming one of the new modalities to reconstitute the depressed immune status of the tumor-bearing host. Interleukin-2, gamma-interferon, and interleukin-12 induce cytolytic activity of LAK and natural killer cells and are considered for cellular activation to locoregional immunotherapy before, after resection or even in unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas. Spleen is a suitable organ for LAK cell induction because it has densely packed lymphocytes. The strategy of administration of both interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon into the spleen for in vivo immunostimulation is based on the well-known synergism of the above cytokines. LAK cells have cytotoxic activity against a variety of tumor cells. In particular, LAK cells exhibit efficacy against lung and liver malignant lesions, as suggested by their trafficking pattern; activated killer cells injected i.v. into humans appeared in the lung early and were subsequently rapidly redistributed to the liver and spleen. Lipiodol-Urografin emulsion is probably an ideal cytokine/anti-cancer drug carrier suitable for the combined locoregional immunochemotherapy because during its preferential retention in the vascular network of the spleen and tumor, a gradual release of both immuno- and chemotherapeutical drugs bound to emulsion droplets is achieved ensuring a prolong half life for these drugs.

The first functional organ to form during embryonic development, the intricately branched network of endothelial and supporting periendothelial cells is essential for the transportation of oxygen and nutrients to and the removal of waste products from the tissues. Serious disruptions in the formation of the vascular network are lethal early in post-implantation development, while the maintenance of vessel integrity and the control of vessel physiology and hemodynamics have important consequences throughout embryonic and adult life. A full understanding of the signaling pathways of vascular development is important not just for understanding normal development but because of the importance of reactivation of angiogenic pathways in disease states. Clinically there is a need to develop therapies to promote new blood vessel formation in situations of severe tissue ischemia, such as coronary heart disease. In addition, there is considerable interest in developing angiogenic inhibitors to block the new vessel growth that solid tumors promote in host tissue to enhance their own growth.

Follicular angiogenesis is essential for growth and health of preovulatory follicles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the morphology and vascularity of transitional anovulatory follicles. On gross inspection, the wall of transitional follicles was visibly less well vascularized than that of preovulatory follicles. Histologically, it could be seen that the theca was only poorly developed in transitional follicles. Immunostaining for factor VIII showed that there were significantly (P < 0.05) fewer blood vessels in the theca of transitional follicles. There was substantially less (P < 0.001) proliferative activity, measured by immunostaining for Ki67, in the endothelial cells and granulosa cells of transitional follicles compared with preovulatory follicles. Preovulatory follicles had a heavy band of immunostaining in the theca for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), whereas staining was sparse in the transitional follicles. It was concluded that the poor vascularity and development of the theca layer in transitional follicles could be related to low circulating LH, and possibly other trophic hormones, and are likely to be the key factors in explaining the steroidogenic incompetence of transitional anovulatory follicles.", "journal": "Reproduction (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2002-07-27", "authors": ["E DWatson", "M OAl-Zi'abi"], "doi": null}

We synthesized a series of alpha,alpha-difluoro(phenyl)methylphosphonic acids (DFPMPAs) which inhibit the action of PTP. In this study, we test their effects on VEGF-induced angiogenesis. DFPMPA-3, the most effective inhibitor of human PTP-1B, promoted tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on Matrigel more effectively than any other DFPMPAs. The inhibitor promoted the VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of HUVEC by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Its effectiveness was proven through neo-vascularization in mice.

Increased demand during this period leads to adaptive changes, particularly vascular changes. The cerebral cortical vascularization is mainly composed of a dense capillary network which extends over the entire cortex and whose density corresponds to the metabolic demand. The development of cortical vascularization starts with perpendicular trunks which branch according to demand and form a cortical capillary network, mediated by factors such as endothelial vascular growth factor (VEGF). Many investigations into the effect of external experience have been done on the visual cortex, both for increase and deprivation.\nPost natal development with enriched visual environments induces increased vascular density. Absence of visual experience leads to a reduction in cortical activity which induces reduced neurone and vascular density, together with delay in maduration of the cortical angio architectural pattern. The relation between the neurone population and superficial vascular density is unchanged.

To study the molecular mechanism of this transformation, we compared RNA expression profiles of KSHV-infected and mock-infected DMVEC. Induction of several proto-oncogenes was observed, particularly the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit. Consistent with increased c-Kit expression, KHSV-infected DMVEC displayed enhanced proliferation in response to the c-Kit ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). Inhibition of c-Kit activity with either a pharmacological inhibitor of c-Kit (STI 571) or a dominant-negative c-Kit protein reversed SCF-dependent proliferation. Importantly, inhibition of c-Kit signal transduction reversed the KSHV-induced morphological transformation of DMVEC.

The anulus fibrosus showed a disturbance of the pattern of overlapping laminae with and without clefts and separation. These resulted in changes indicative of stenosis of vascular buds and perivascular calcification. Nicotine treatment resulted in hypertrophy of vascular walls, necrotic changes in endothelial cells, and narrowing of the vascular lumen. Nicotine treatment resulted in delineation of vascular buds in the vicinity of the vertebral endplate and a reduction of their numbers. However, the control animals showed a dense vascular network.

The objective of this study was to determine the fate of the donor bone marrow after transplantation of a limb allograft in a miniature swine model.\nCTAs from donor swine were heterotopically transplanted into six MHC-matched, minor-antigen-mismatched recipients, and a 12-day course of cyclosporine was given. Previous animals transplanted without cyclosporine rejected their grafts in less than 42 days. A non-MHC-linked marker, pig allelic antigen (PAA), was used to distinguish host and donor cells. Three PAA- animals received PAA+ CTAs, and three PAA+ animals received PAA- CTAs. Bone marrow was harvested from the donor limb grafts and the recipient and analyzed by flow cytometry and histology. Thymus, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes were also harvested from the recipient swine and evaluated for the presence of donor cells by flow cytometry.\nAll animals receiving cyclosporine demonstrated permanent tolerance to their allografts. Donor bone marrow cells were present in all grafts at the time of transplantation and during the immediate postoperative period. By 48 weeks, donor cells were no longer detectable within the marrow space of the allograft. In long-term animals host bone marrow cells replaced donor cells in the graft marrow space. No evidence of donor cell engraftment was found in recipient animals.\nThis study demonstrates that in long-term tolerant recipients of musculoskeletal allografts there is no evidence of persistent donor bone marrow cells in the hematopoietic tissues of the graft or the host.

{"title": "The utility of both muscle and fascia flaps in severe upper extremity trauma.", "abstract": "Severe isolated upper extremity injuries are rarely lethal; however, they invariably are resource intensive, create significant disability, and promote resistance to a return to gainful employment. Appropriate soft tissue restoration is an essential component of any treatment protocol, and often requires a vascularized flap to protect the superficial neurovascular and musculotendinous structures. A basic schema to facilitate flap selection in the upper extremity is introduced.\nThe role of local muscle and fascia flaps or free tissue transfers for severe upper extremity injuries was retrospectively reviewed from a two-decade experience. Excluding digital injuries, primary treatment of soft tissue traumatic wounds requiring some form of vascularized flap occurred in 33 limbs in 31 patients. The choice of flap donor site, type, specific complications and benefits as related to the severity of injury, and the effect of timing of wound closure were compared.\nInitial coverage after significant upper extremity trauma in these 33 limbs required 16 local fascia flaps, 22 free flaps, 1 multistaged distant pedicled flap, and 1 local muscle flap. Flaps were selected in a nonrandom fashion on the basis of wound location, severity of injury, and flap availability. Complication rates were similar for local fascia and free flaps. The upper extremity could be divided into three regions that were differentiated according to the observed incidence of flap preference. Free flaps were more commonly used for hand and wrist wounds, or anywhere the defect was moderately large in size or extremely severe in overall injury. Local fascia flaps were a simpler option most applicable for the central upper limb. Local muscles as flaps were intentionally avoided to minimize any functional derangement.\nA schema to guide flap selection for upper extremity coverage is introduced that is predicated on using the best available option. The shoulder girdle and axilla are reached by many local trunk muscle or fascia flaps. The central upper limb about the elbow often is conducive to coverage with specific local fascia flaps. The distal upper extremity may be best served by a free flap, as would any large wound in all upper limb regions.", "journal": "The Journal of trauma", "date": "2002-07-20", "authors": ["Geoffrey GHallock"], "doi": "10.1097/00005373-200207000-00013"}

For this purpose, five adult Dutch Warmblood horses were used in which the sesamoidean artery was occluded with polyvinyl alcohol foam particles. Bone labelling was carried out with oxytetracycline and calcein. All animal were checked clinically three times a week and radiographically at days 14, 21, 28 and 35.

The PSBs were isolated and radiographed and the soft tissues adjacent to the abaxial side of the PSBs were histologically examined [routine histology and for the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)]. The PSBs were divided into bony slices which were radiographed and evaluated histologically (routine, SP, CGRP, fluorescence). All horses showed a slight lameness that gradually diminished. Radiographically enlarged vascular channels were seen in only one horse. Histological data showed that on average 60% (range 37-89%) of the total area had been deprived of vascularization. In two horses an increase in the extent of the arterial network from the basal side of the PSB was seen. Only in the horse with the greatest extent of occlusion were bone necrosis and a reactively increased uptake of fluorochromes adjacent to the occluded arteries found. Bone density did not change. The distribution of neuropeptides in the surrounding soft tissues was not affected by the occlusion.

PhagoBioDerm is a novel wound-healing preparation consisting of a biodegradable polymer impregnated with an antibiotic and lytic bacteriophages, which was recently licensed for sale in the Republic of Georgia (one of the former Soviet Union republics). In 1999-2000, in Tbilisi, Georgia, 107 patients who had ulcers that had failed to respond to conventional therapy were treated with PhagoBioDerm alone or in combination with other interventions. The wounds/ulcers healed completely in 67 (70%) of 96 patients for whom follow-up data were available. In 22 cases in which microbiologic data were available, healing was associated with the concomitant elimination of, or a reduction in, specific pathogenic bacteria in the ulcers.

In neonates, splenic WPs are exclusively B-cell zones containing sIgM+-MHC class IIlow B cells; thus compartmentalized areas with T cells and DCs, as well as surface Ig novel antigen receptor (sIgNAR)-expressing B cells are absent at birth. Not until the pups are 5 months old do these WP areas become adult-like; concomitantly, sIgNAR+ B cells are readily detectable, indicating that this Ig class requires a 'mature immune-responsive environment'. The epigonal organ is the major site of neonatal B lymphopoiesis, based on the presence of developing B cells and recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1)/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, indicative of antigen receptor rearrangement; such expression persists into adult life, whereas the spleen has negligible lymphopoietic activity. In adults but not neonates, many secretory B cells reside in the epigonal organ, suggesting, like in mammals, that B cells home to this primary lymphoid tissue after activation in other areas of the body.", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of immunology", "date": "2002-07-18", "authors": ["L LRumfelt", "E CMcKinney", "ETaylor", "M FFlajnik"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-3083.2002.01116.x"}

The rationale for surgical intervention is predicated on the need to repair the mucogingival defect and to establish adequate thickness of attached gingiva. The free gingival graft, usually obtained from the hard palate, is often used to increase the amount of attached gingiva. The prospect of a second surgical site, and its inherent risks and complications, which may include pain, discomfort, and bleeding, is especially undesirable in children. Important to consider is the possibility that a child may not have adequate tissue thickness at the donor site. A case report is presented utilizing the alternative soft tissue graft, Alloderm, to correct a mucogingival defect prior to orthodontic treatment. Adhering to the free gingival autograft technique, an acellular dermal matrix allograft was utilized at the graft site. The patient revealed good post-operative healing, tissue vascularization, and a healthy zone of attached gingiva at the six month follow up visit.

Dosages of sirolimus and tacrolimus were adjusted for trough levels of 10-15 ng/mL and 4-6 ng/mL, respectively. Treated monkeys (n = 5) had significantly prolonged allograft survival, with a mean survival of 36 days vs. 7 days in untreated controls (n = 6, p = 0.008). Four of five treated animals, but none of the controls, developed fibrinoid vascular necrosis of the small intestine.

{"title": "Fish gill morphology: inside out.", "abstract": "In this short review of fish gill morphology we cover some basic gross anatomy as well as in some more detail the microscopic anatomy of the branchial epithelia from representatives of the major extant groups of fishes (Agnathans, Elasmobranchs, and Teleosts). The agnathan hagfishes have primitive gill pouches, while the lampreys have arch-like gills similar to the higher fishes. In the lampreys and elasmobranchs, the gill filaments are supported by a complete interbranchial septum and water exits via external branchial slits or pores. In contrast, the teleost interbranchial septum is much reduced, leaving the ends of the filaments unattached, and the multiple gill openings are replaced by the single caudal opening of the operculum. The basic functional unit of the gill is the filament, which supports rows of plate-like lamellae. The lamellae are designed for gas exchange with a large surface area and a thin epithelium surrounding a well-vascularized core of pillar cell capillaries. The lamellae are positioned for the blood flow to be counter-current to the water flow over the gills. Despite marked differences in the gross anatomy of the gill among the various groups, the cellular constituents of the epithelium are remarkably similar. The lamellar gas-exchange surface is covered by squamous pavement cells, while large, mitochondria-rich, ionocytes and mucocytes are found in greatest frequency in the filament epithelium. Demands for ionoregulation can often upset this balance. There has been much study of the structure and function of the branchial mitochondria-rich cells. These cells are generally characterized by a high mitochondrial density and an amplification of the basolateral membrane through folding or the presence of an intracellular tubular system.

The prognostic significance of the vascularity of different tumour areas was also evaluated. Despite morphometry revealing several-fold higher microvessel densities (MVDs) in the peritumoural tissue than at the centre of the tumour, the development of visceral metastases of hMM was exclusively correlated with the MVD of the tumour centre. Furthermore, the 5-year survival of the patient group with low tumour centre MVD (<30/mm(2), n=29) was 100%, compared to 1/16 patients alive with high tumour centre MVD (>30/mm(2), n=16). Morphometric analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction of vessel networks of both human and murine melanomas showed clearly that the peritumoural vascular plexus present at the melanoma base is continuously being incorporated into the growing tumour mass. Once vessels become incorporated, sprouting ceases and the proliferating endothelial cells (EC) take part only in vessel dilatation. Moreover, the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characterization of microvessels demonstrated that the pericyte coverage of endothelial tubes was complete in all of the investigated areas, in both human and murine melanomas.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2002-07-13", "authors": ["Bal\u00e1zsD\u00f6me", "S\u00e1ndorPaku", "Be\u00e1taSomlai", "J\u00f3zsefT\u00edm\u00e1r"], "doi": "10.1002/path.1124"}

The process of angiogenesis involves endothelial cell migration so as to reorganize into vessel structures. The extent of cellular motility is regulated in part by the balance between serine/threonine kinases and protein phosphatases. In the present study, we show a decline in the activity of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP-2A in endothelial cells whose motility is stimulated by exposure to medium conditioned by either murine LLC cells or human HNSCC cells. Inhibition of endothelial cell PP-2A pharmacologically by treatment with okadaic acid also stimulated endothelial cell motility. Identification of mechanisms by which PP-2A inhibition might stimulate endothelial cell motility focused on proteins of the focal adhesions. Inhibition of PP-2A caused hyperphosphorylation of the paxillin serine residues and dephosphorylation of its tyrosine residues, dissolution of FAK/Src/paxillin complexes and decreased phosphorylation of the inhibitory Y529 residue of Src, suggesting increased Src activity. Inhibition of Src activity prevented the stimulation of PP-2A-inhibited cell motility.

We report here that the hybrid tumors grow faster and have a strikingly better developed vasculature than the parent sarcoma. Thus, electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in the most active areas of neovascularization, the tumors that emerged from inocula of monoclonal hybrid cell populations had a microvessel density nearly twice that of Meth A tumors after 1 week of growth. Moreover, the proportion of vessels associated with pericytes, detected by staining for smooth muscle alpha-actin, was 3 times higher in the hybrid tumors, attesting to the more advanced differentiation of their vasculature. The collagenous stroma component was also more extensive in the hybrid tumors. Concentration of the angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were significantly higher in supernatants of hybrid cell cultures compared with Meth A cultures. These observations indicate that the growth advantage of the hybrid tumors over the parental sarcoma is due to a higher angiogenic capacity. Because the malignant features of many tumors correlate with angiogenesis and because macrophages are known to be major producers of angiogenic factors, our data open the possibility that the intense neovascularization of highly aggressive cancers in some cases reflects the acquisition of macrophage traits by heterotypic cell fusion.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2002-07-13", "authors": ["Lill-Tove RBusund", "Mette KKillie", "KristianBartnes", "RolfSeljelid"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.10502"}
{"title": "Button osteoma: its etiology and pathophysiology.", "abstract": "The present study investigates a circumscribed bony overgrowth on the cranial vault, known as button osteoma (BtO) and referred to here as button lesion (BtL). We discuss its anthropological implications. Data on its histology, location, and population distribution (by age, race, and gender) are provided. Microscopically, BtL is composed of well-organized dense lamellated bone which is poorly vascularized and with very few osteocytes. It forms a dome-shaped roof over an underlying diploeized area which includes the ectocranial table. The frequency of BtL is similar in modern (37.6%) and archaeological (41.1%) populations, in blacks, whites, males, and females, and correlates with age. It is rare in nonhuman primates. Fifty-five percent of the human skulls studied by us had BtL only on the parietal, 23.6% on the frontal, and 3.6% on the occipital bones. Fifteen percent had BtL on both the frontal and parietal bones. No lateral preference was found. Most skulls with BtL (64.1%) had only one lesion, 20.4% had two BtL, and 15.4% demonstrated multiple BtL. The average number of button osteomas on an affected skull was 1.97. The frequency of large osteomas (0.5-1.0 cm) was similar in young and old age groups. The demographic characteristics of BtL, mainly its high frequency among ancient and modern populations, its independence of sex and race, its scarcity in other primates, and the fact that its macro- and microstruture are indicative of an hamartoma (and not an osteoma or exostosis) suggest an evolutionary background to the phenomenon.", "journal": "American journal of physical anthropology", "date": "2002-07-13", "authors": ["VeredEshed", "BruceLatimer", "Charles MGreenwald", "Lyman MJellema", "Bruce MRothschild", "SusanneWish-Baratz", "IsraelHershkovitz"], "doi": "10.1002/ajpa.10087"}

In the present study, we investigated whether targeting IL-8 by a fully human anti-IL-8 antibody (ABX-IL8) could be a potential therapeutic strategy to control angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of melanoma. The human melanoma cells A375SM (high IL-8 producer) and TXM-13 (intermediate IL-8 producer) were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, which were then treated with ABX-IL8 (1 mg/3 times weekly, i.p., for 3 weeks). Tumor growth of both melanomas in ABX-IL8-treated mice was significantly inhibited when compared with control IgG-treated animals. ABX-IL8 treatment also suppressed experimental metastasis when the melanoma cells were injected intravenously. IL-8 blockade by ABX-IL8 significantly inhibited the promoter activity and the collagenase activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in human melanoma cells, resulting in decreased invasion through reconstituted basement membrane in vitro. In vivo, ABX-IL8 treatment resulted in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, and decreased vascularization (angiogenesis) of tumors concomitant with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, in an in vitro vessel formation assay, ABX-IL8 directly interfered with the tubule formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Furthermore, cells lacking the receptor due to targeted disruption of the IGF1R gene do not survive as well as normal cells in such conditions. In addition, we find that cells can activate the IGF1R gene promoter in response to these conditions, and immunoblot analyses show increased receptor protein levels in cell exposed to hypoxia.

{"title": "Intraosseous circulation from physiology to disease.", "abstract": "Blood flow within bones is unique in two ways: (1) the blood circulates within a closed cavity in which pressure must remain constant, a feat achieved in part thanks to the considerable distensibility of the intraosseous vessels and, above all, veins; (2) the intraosseous circulation allows traffic of minerals between the blood and bone tissue and sends the blood cells produced within the bone marrow into the systemic circulation. In contrast, the arterioles and capillaries within bones have the same anatomic structure as those located elsewhere in the body and are susceptible to arteriosclerosis, arteritis, or thrombosis. The mechanisms that regulate blood flow within bone are incompletely understood, probably because they are difficult to study in vivo. The cytokines and growth factors that regulate intraosseous angiogenesis also regulate bone remodeling, and close links exist between the blood supply to bone and bone formation and resorption: most diseases characterized by increased bone resorption are associated with increased bone vascularization. The vascular bud located at the center of bone multicellular units (BMUs) may determine the timing of bone resorption and bone formation.

Full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of pigs, contaminated with an experimental inoculum containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium sp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and covered with dressing products either containing silver or not. Nanocrystalline silver-coated dressings promoted rapid wound healing, particularly during the first several days post-injury. Healing was characterized by rapid development of well vascularized granulation tissue that supported tissue grafting 4 days post-injury, unlike control dressed wounds. The proteolytic environment of wounds treated with nanocrystalline silver was characterized by reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinases. Matrix metalloproteinases have been shown to be present in chronic ulcers at abnormally high levels, as compared with acute wounds, and may contribute to the nonhealing nature of these wounds. Cellular apoptosis occurred at a higher frequency in the nanocrystalline silver-treated wounds than in wounds dressed with other products. The results suggest that nanocrystalline silver may play a role in altering or compressing the inflammatory events in wounds and facilitating the early phases of wound healing. These benefits are associated with reduced local matrix metalloproteinase levels and enhanced cellular apoptosis.", "journal": "Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society", "date": "2002-07-09", "authors": ["J BarryWright", "KanLam", "Andre GBuret", "Merle EOlson", "Robert EBurrell"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1524-475x.2002.10308.x"}
{"title": "Intradermal cell transplantation in soluble collagen.", "abstract": "Intradermal, as opposed to subcutaneous, cell transplantation was previously shown to be advantageous for tumor cell growth, but this site has not been used for transplantation of normal nonneoplastic cells. In preliminary experiments we found that it was difficult to control the size and shape of transplants when we injected dissociated cells intradermally. This problem was solved by placing cells in nongelled, pepsin-solubilized collagen prior to injection. This technique permitted the successful transplantation of normal bovine adrenocortical cells and of neoplastic cells (3T3 cells secreting FGF) in scid mice. Primary bovine adrenocortical cells formed functional vascularized tissue and the transplants rescued the animals from the lethal effects of adrenalectomy. The histological structure of transplant tissues resembled that previously observed when cells were transplanted in the subrenal capsule space. We also used a line of 3T3 cells that has been genetically modified to secrete a form of acidic FGF. When transplanted intradermally in collagen, they formed rapidly enlarging masses of cells that could easily be palpated beneath the skin of the animal. Intradermal injection of cells in pepsin-solubilized collagen is a simple and reliable technique for transplanting normal primary cells and preneoplastic cells. The ability to grow both types of cells in an easily accessible site allows less invasive monitoring of growth, angiogenesis, and other features of the transplant.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2002-07-09", "authors": ["HaoZhang", "Peter JHornsby"], "doi": null}

In this study we evaluated if ectopic bone formation could be induced by a construct made of human periosteal cells and a novel scaffold architecture whose mechanical properties are in the range of cancellous bone. Biopsies from human calvarial periosteum were harvested and cells were isolated from the inner cambial layer. Fifty thousand periosteal cells were seeded into the scaffolds measuring 6 x 6 x 2 mm. The cell-scaffold constructs were cultured for a period of 3 weeks prior to implantation into balb C nude mice. Mice were sacrificed and implants were analyzed 6 and 17 weeks postoperatively. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the osteoblastic phenotype of the seeded cells. Formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers could be observed in both scaffold architectures. Three-dimensional cell proliferation was observed after 2 weeks of culturing with centripetal growth pattern inside the pore network. The deposition of calcified extracellular matrix was observed after 3 weeks of culturing. In vivo, endochondral bone formation with osteoid production was detectable via von Kossa and Osteocalcin staining after 6 and 17 weeks.

The pre-therapeutic grade of hypervascularization in the periphery of autonomous nodules correlated closely with the laboratory parameters of hyperthyroidism. As expected, PD indicated a higher grade of vascularization when compared with CD due to its greater sensitivity to flow.\nRadioiodine therapy led to a significant reduction in hypervascularization in patients with AN (but not in GD) corresponding to the normalization of serological values.

Cbfal-deficient (Cbfa1-/-) mice displayed a complete absence of osteoblast and osteoclast maturation as well as severely inhibited chondrocyte maturation in most parts of the skeleton. Although chondrocyte maturation and mineralization were observed in restricted areas of Cbfa1-/- mouse skeleton, vascular invasion of calcified cartilage was never noted. To investigate the possibility of chondrocyte maturation and vascular invasion in Cbfal-/- cartilage and the role of the hematopoietic system in the process of vascular invasion, we transplanted embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) Cbfa1-/- femurs, which are composed of immature chondrocytes, into spleens of normal mice. One week later, the transplanted femurs contained terminally differentiated chondrocytes expressing osteopontin, bone sialoprotein (BSP), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 13. In the diaphyses of the transplants, the cartilage matrix was mineralized and the cartilage was invaded by vascular vessels and osteoclasts. However, chondrocyte maturation and vascular invasion were severely retarded in comparison with transplants of E14.5 wild-type femurs, in which the cartilage was rapidly replaced by bone, and neither mature osteoblasts nor bone formation were observed. In primary culture of Cbfa1-/- chondrocytes, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and thyroid hormone (T3) induced osteopontin and MMP-13 expression. These findings indicated that factors in the hematopoietic system are able to support vascular invasion of cartilage independent of Cbfal but are less effective without it, suggesting that Cbfal functions in cooperation with factors from bone marrow in the process of growth plate vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2002-07-05", "authors": ["MikiHimeno", "HirayukiEnomoto", "WenguangLiu", "KiyotoIshizeki", "ShintaroNomura", "YukihikoKitamura", "ToshihisaKomori"], "doi": "10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.7.1297"}

{"title": "Characterization of the macrophages associated with the tunica vasculosa lentis of the rat eye.", "abstract": "The tunica vasculosa lentis (TVL) is a transient vascular network surrounding the developing lens that regresses prenatally in humans and postnatally in rodents. Macrophage-like cells, sometimes referred to as hyalocytes, have been postulated to play a role in the regression of this vascular system; however, the precise identity of these cells is still unclear. The aim of the present investigation was to provide phenotypic data on these cells in combination with their three-dimensional distribution on the lens surface during the period when regression of the TVL is taking place. To this end the authors have used a novel combination of silver-enhanced immunogold labeling and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM).\nThe eyes of Wistar rats at various pre- and postnatal ages (E20, postnatal days [D]0, 2, 5, 7, and 10) were studied by either conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or ESEM. The latter was used to study specimens that had been incubated with various antileukocyte monoclonal antibodies (ED1, ED2, Ox6, Ox42), followed by immunolabeling with gold-conjugated secondary antibody visualized by silver enhancement.\nConventional SEM of the developing lens revealed a pattern of radial and interconnecting vessels in the TVL similar to previous studies. In addition, large numbers of cells with the morphologic characteristics of macrophages were noted on the lens surface closely associated with the vessels. The gradual attenuation and regression of vessels was noted over the course of the time period investigated. Immunolabeled specimens examined by ESEM revealed that most of the macrophage-like cells were indeed ED1(+) and ED2(+) (both pan-macrophage markers) and MHC class II(-) (Ox6) and CD11b/18(-) (Ox42): a phenotype characteristic of macrophages. This phenotype altered little between E20 and D10.\nThe cells surrounding the developing lens that are postulated to play a role in regression of the TVL have the morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of resident tissue macrophages similar to those previously identified in the adult rodent uveal tract and the vitreous (hyalocytes). This phenotype differs from that of dendritic cells and microglia; however, it is postulated that lens-associated macrophages are ideally located to act as a source of retinal microglia after completion of their role in TVL regression.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2002-07-02", "authors": ["Paul GMcMenamin", "JennyDjano", "RosamundWealthall", "Brendan JGriffin"], "doi": null}

The purpose of our study was to define the angiogenesys in the fetal encephalon at different stages of development. To this purpose, we examinated 13 fetal and newborn encephalons between the 10th and 33rd week. To label blood vessels, we used an immunohistochemical procedure based on the detection of two antigens located within endothelial cells: CD31 and CD34. The cerebral vascularization modifies in quantity and in structure during pregnancy, with important topographic differences between cerebral cortex and striatal-limbic areas. We observed two microarchitectural patterns: 1. Rectangular mesh pattern, characterized by capillaries that join transversally to one or more branches that deepen orthogonally from the surface of the meninges; 2. Hexagonal mesh pattern, which surrounds small groups of neurons and develops with a honeycomb shape. The rectangular mesh pattern is mostly observed from the 13th to 26th week in the white matter, in the hippocampus and in the cortex. The hexagonal mesh pattern is typical of the basal nuclei, and of the cerebral cortex during the 10th-12th week and after the 26th-27th week. Until the 26th week the vascularization increases mainly in the hippocampus and in the basal nuclei. The cortex shows a vascularization increment, greater than in the limbic system, with a pattern prevalently hexagonal in areas were the neurons' number increases. Our data demonstrate that, in the human fetus, cerebral capillaries are not of terminal type. On the contrary, they show a rich anastomotic network that has different patterns in white matter (rectangular pattern) or in grey matter (hexagonal pattern). The functional meaning of this difference is unknown, but we can suppose that its role is to warrant availability of nutritional substances within regions where a high number of neurons is present.

We addressed whether onset of angiogenesis occurs in BE and if the lymphatic system might provide a route for Barrett's adenocarcinoma cells to infiltrate regular lymph nodes.\nFifteen surgically resected Barrett's dysplasia or adenocarcinoma patients were included. Immunohistochemistry and a modified whole mount analysis were used.\nThe incipient angiogenesis originates from the pre-existing vascular network in the lamina propria and infiltrates Barrett's epithelium, giving its ominous salmon-red color.

However, the long-term influences of cytokines on acute incisional wounds with respect to breaking strength, quality of the scar etc. have not been elucidated completely. In the present study, the breaking strength of scars produced by full thickness incisional wounds of the skin created on backs of rabbits were compared when the wounds were treated by conventional suturing or with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in addition to suturing. We administered bFGF to full thickness acute incisional wounds of the skin created on backs of rabbits. The breaking strengths of wounds treated by conventional suturing and those treated with bFGF soon after the operation were compared as were the conditions of the scars after long-term follow up of up to 7 weeks. They were also examined histopathologically. Administration of bFGF at the time of wound closure, especially 1.0 microg in amount per cm, increased the breaking strength significantly compared to the control group from 5 weeks after the operation. Moreover, histopathological examination revealed that there was rich vascularization soon after the operation and an arrangement of collagen fibers which lenticulated horizontally from the 5th week and later after the operation in the bFGF treated groups in a dose dependent manner. This study demonstrates that administration of bFGF at the time of wound closure significantly increased the breaking strength compared to the control group from 5 weeks after the operation. And the administration of bFGF also improved the quality of the scar, the condition of the scar by surface condition by inspection as well as the width of scar at histological evaluations.

We hypothesized that the presence of metastases could result in a disturbance of the fibrinolytic balance of the blood. To test our hypothesis, we have developed a unique enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that can measure both the total amount as well as the active fraction of PAI1 in the plasma. We then used this novel assay to analyze the plasmatic PAI1 levels and activity of patients with advanced melanoma (AM, n = 18) and primary melanoma (PM, n = 21) and compare it to a control population (n = 38). We found no statistically significant difference in the total plasmatic PAI1 levels between the controls and patients with PM or AM (P = 0.6199). In contrast, there was a significant difference in the active fraction of PAI1 between the controls and patients with PM or AM (P = 0.0076).

{"title": "Successful transplantation of three tissue-engineered cell types using capsule induction technique and fibrin glue as a delivery vehicle.", "abstract": "Recent advances in cell biology and tissue engineering have used various delivery vehicles for transplanting varying cell cultures with limited success. These techniques are frequently complicated by tissue necrosis, infection, and resorption. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether urothelium cells, tracheal epithelial cells, and preadipocytes cultured in vitro could be successfully transplanted onto a prefabricated capsule surface by using fibrin glue as a delivery vehicle, with the ultimate goal for use in reconstruction. In the first step of the animal study, tissue specimens (bladder urothelium, tracheal epithelial cells, epididymal fat pad) were harvested for in vitro cell culturing, and a silicone block was implanted subcutaneously or within the anterior rectus sheath to induce capsule formation. After 6 to 10 days, when primary cultures were confluent, the animals were re-anesthetized, the newly formed capsule pouches were incised, and the suspensions of cultured urothelia cells (n = 40), tracheal epithelial cells (n = 32), and preadipocytes (n = 40) were implanted onto the capsule surface in two groups, one using standard culture medium as a delivery vehicle and the second using fibrin glue. Histologic sections were taken, and different histomorphologic studies were performed according to tissue type. Consistently in all animals, a highly vascularized capsule was induced by the silicon material. In all animals in which the authors used fibrin glue as a delivery vehicle, they could demonstrate a successful reimplantation of cultured urothelium cells, tracheal epithelial cells, or preadipocytes. Their animal studies showed that capsule induction in combination with fibrin glue as a delivery vehicle is a successful model for transplantation of different in vivo cultured tissue types.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-06-28", "authors": ["GottfriedWechselberger", "Robert CRussell", "Michael WNeumeister", "ThomasSchoeller", "HildegundePiza-Katzer", "ChristianRainer"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200207000-00022"}

The objectives of this study are to compare clinical and radiographic results between the partial wrist arthrodesis and the wrist arthroplasty, and to discuss which procedure is superior. Four patients with giant-cell tumors involving the distal end of the radius were treated with en bloc resection and reconstruction with a free vascularized fibular graft. The wrists in two patients were reconstructed with an articular fibular head graft and the remaining two patients underwent partial wrist arthrodesis using a fibular shaft transfer. There was radiographic evidence of bone union at the host-graft junctions in all cases. In the newly reconstructed wrist joint, there was palmar subluxation of the carpal bones and degenerative changes in both patients. Local recurrence was seen in one patient. According to the functional results described by Enneking et al., the mean functional score was 67 percent. The functional scores including wrist/forearm range of motion in the cases with partial wrist arthrodesis were superior to those with wrist arthroplasty. A partial wrist arthrodesis using a vascularized fibular shaft graft appears a more useful and reliable procedure for reconstruction of the wrist after excision of the giant-cell tumor of the distal end of the radius than a wrist arthroplasty using the vascularized fibular head, although our study includes only a small number of patients.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-06-28", "authors": ["AkioMinami", "HiroyukiKato", "NorimasaIwasaki"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200207000-00020"}

Recent investigations provided increasing evidence that quantitative analysis of tumour angiogenesis is an indispensable prerequisite for developing novel treatment strategies such as anti-angiogenic and antivascular treatment options. Therefore, it was our aim to establish and validate a new and versatile imaging technique, that is orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging, allowing for non-invasive quantitative imaging of tumour angiogenesis in vivo. Experiments were performed in amelanotic melanoma A-MEL 3 implanted in a transparent dorsal skinfold chamber of the hamster. Starting at day 0 after tumour cell implantation, animals were treated daily with the anti-angiogenic compound SU5416 (25 mg kg x bw(-1)) or vehicle (control) only. Functional vessel density, diameter of microvessels and red blood cell velocity were visualised by both orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging and fluorescence microscopy and analysed using a digital image system. The morphological and functional properties of the tumour microvasculature could be clearly identified by orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging. Data for functional vessel density correlated excellently with data obtained by fluorescence microscopy (y=0.99x+0.48, r2=0.97, R(S)=0.98, precision: 8.22 cm(-1) and bias: -0.32 cm(-1)). Correlation parameters for diameter of microvessels and red blood cell velocity were similar (r2=0.97, R(S)=0.99 and r2=0.93, R(S)=0.94 for diameter of microvessels and red blood cell velocity, respectively). Treatment with SU5416 reduced tumour angiogenesis. At day 3 and 6 after tumour cell implantation, respectively, functional vessel density was 4.8+/-2.1 and 87.2+/-10.2 cm(-1) compared to values of control animals of 66.6+/-10.1 and 147.4+/-13.2 cm(-1), respectively. In addition to the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, tumour growth and the development of metastasis was strongly reduced in SU5416 treated animals. This new approach enables non-invasive, repeated and quantitative assessment of tumour vascular network and the effects of antiangiogenic treatment on tumour vasculature in vivo. Thus, quantification of tumour angiogenesis can be used to more accurately classify and monitor tumour biologic characteristics, and to explore aggressiveness of tumours.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2002-06-27", "authors": ["SPahernik", "A GHarris", "MSchmitt-Sody", "SKrasnici", "A EGoetz", "MDellian", "KMessmer"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjc.6600318"}

Blockade of this costimulatory pathway has been shown to prevent acute allograft rejection in murine, as well as nonhuman primate models. However, the role of the CD40-CD154 pathway in the development of chronic rejection and the effects of CD154 targeting on progression of chronic rejection have not been evaluated.\nWe examined the effect of AH.F5, a new hamster anti-rat CD154 monoclonal antibody, in a fully allogeneic acute(u) into Lewis [LEW] (RT11) and chronic [WF.1L (RT1l) into LEW (RT1l)] vascularized cardiac allograft rejection model. In the chronic model, the antibody was evaluated for prevention (starting day of transplant) and interruption of progression (starting day 30 or 60 after transplant) of chronic vasculopathy. Graft survival, morphology, and immunohistology were evaluated.\nIn the acute rejection model, anti-CD154 therapy alone prevented acute allograft rejection and resulted in 50% long-term allograft survival (>200 days) and donor-specific tolerance. In recipients treated with anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody in combination with a short course of cyclosporine, 100% of allografts survived long-term and all recipients achieved donor-specific tolerance. In the chronic rejection model, allografts from animals treated with the anti-CD154 antibody had a statistically significant lower score of graft arteriosclerosis and fibrosis in both the prevention and 30-day interruption groups when compared with control allografts. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed a decrease in intragraft mononuclear cell infiltration and activation.\nA new anti-CD154 antibody not only prevents acute allograft rejection, but also inhibits and interrupts the development of chronic rejection. In the acute rejection model cyclosporine acts synergistically with anti-CD154 therapy to prolong allograft survival and induce tolerance.

It plays a well established and vital role in oocyte maturation by participating in metaphase II arrest and meiotic asymmetric division, but little is known about its function in somatic cells. Recently, we observed overexpressed c-mos in a portion of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCS). In particular, c-mos immunoreactivity was detected in tumor cell nuclei in addition to its expected cytoplasmic localization, and c-mos overexpression was associated with chromosomal instability among other findings. To verify our earlier observations and to clarify further the role of c-mos in NSCLCS, we examined its distribution by both light and electron microscopy. We detected c-mos in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a portion of tumor cells and fibroblasts. In particular, granular immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm closely associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear staining was confirmed and was often found near the nuclear membrane, as well as in some large multilobular, possibly aneuploid, nuclei. C-mos positivity was also found in the nuclei of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, c-mos was detected in areas with diminished vascularization. It should be noted that nuclear staining was found at the ultrastructural level more extensively than at the light microscope study.

Chronic rejection (CR) develops in these long surviving grafts. The pathologic features of CR in this model are similar to CR in human kidney grafts.\nTo explore the role of donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens in the development of CR, we performed vascularized kidney transplants using kidneys from donor mice that lack expression of both MHC class I and II antigens (MHC-/-).\nSurvival was significantly improved in recipients of MHC-/- allografts. This enhanced survival was associated with higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in MHC-/- allografts (4.92 +/- 0.54 cc/min/kg) compared to controls (2.19 +/- 0.63 cc/min/kg; P = 0.004). The typical histologic features of CR were markedly reduced in MHC-/- allografts. Semiquantitative histopathological scores for MHC-/- grafts (13.3 +/- 2.1) were significantly lower than in control allografts (19.0 +/- 1.0; P = 0.04). Along with this improvement in structural abnormalities, significantly fewer CD4+ T (38.3 cells/mm(2) vs. 75.0 cells/mm(2); P = 0.008), CD8+ T cells (38.7 vs. 96 cells/mm(2), respectively; P = 0.008) and macrophages (60 vs. 134 cells/mm(2), respectively; P = 0.04) infiltrated MHC-/- allografts compared to controls. The levels of intragraft cytokine mRNA expression also were reduced in MHC-/- allografts compared to control allografts. Finally, serum alloantibodies were virtually undetectable in recipients of MHC-/- kidney allografts.\nCell surface expression of donor MHC antigens promotes the development of CR.

In the present study, in situ hybridization has been used to examine mRNA expression for several factors that may be implicated in the apoptosis seen in this tissue. Skin wounds were made on the dorsal skin of 8-week-old rats. Ten days after wounding, skin flaps were created surgically and sutured over the granulation tissue. Tissue sections of granulation tissue from various times after addition of the skin flap were hybridized with 33P-labelled cRNA probes for transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), beta-inducible gene H3 (beta-ig-h3), alpha1 (1) procollagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and -2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Control granulation tissue prior to addition of the skin flap showed high levels of TGF-beta1, beta-ig-h3, alpha1 (1) procollagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and TIMP-1 expression. MMP-13, MMP-2, and iNOS mRNA were low in 10-day granulation tissue. Addition of a skin flap resulted in a decrease in the expression of TGF-beta1, beta-ig-h3, alpha1 (I) procollagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and TIMP-1, but increased expression of MMP-13 and MMP-2. Similarly, an increase in iNOS mRNA expression was observed in the granulation tissue after addition of the skin flap. Addition of a vascularized skin flap may result in rapid remodelling of granulation tissue due to a decrease in expression of the trophic growth factor TGF-beta1 and increased degradation of extracellular matrix due to an alteration in the balance between MMPs and their inhibitor, TIMP-1. Additionally, increased iNOS expression may also favour apoptosis through the generation of free radicals. The additive effect of reduced growth factor expression, increased extracellular matrix turnover, and nitric oxide generation may result in the fibroblast and vascular cell apoptosis seen during the rapid remodelling of this tissue.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2002-06-26", "authors": ["Ian ADarby", "TeresaBisucci", "BrigittePittet", "StefaniaGarbin", "GiulioGabbiani", "AlexisDesmouli\u00e8re"], "doi": "10.1002/path.1074"}

To identify the most effective anti-angiogenic molecule for delivery by retroviral vectors, we investigated the effects of angiostatin, endostatin and interferon(IFN)-alpha(1) gene transfer in in vivo models of breast cancer induced neovascularization and tumor growth. Moloney leukemia virus-based retroviral vectors for expression of murine angiostatin, endostatin and IFN-alpha(1) were generated, characterized, and used to transduce human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB435). Secretion of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by biological and Western blotting assays. Their production did not impair in vitro growth of these breast cancer cells nor their viability, and did not interfere with the expression of angiogenic factors. However, primary endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro were inhibited by supernatants of the transduced cells containing angiostatin, endostatin, and IFN-alpha(1). Stable gene transfer of the IFN-alpha(1) cDNA by retroviral vectors in both MCF7 and MDA-MB435 cells resulted in a marked and long-lasting inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice that was associated with reduced vascularization. Endostatin reduced the in vivo growth of MDA-MB435, but not MCF7 cells, despite similar levels of in vivo production, and angiostatin did not impair the in vivo growth of either cell line.

{"title": "Luteotropic roles of prolactin in early pregnant hamsters.", "abstract": "Prolactin (PRL) has long been regarded as a luteotropin maintaining early pregnancy in rodents. To delineate luteotropic roles of PRL in terms of luteal vascularization and immune privilege, luteal expression of Thy-1 differentiation protein, Fas, and Fas ligand (FasL) in early pregnancy was studied in hamsters on Day 4 of pregnancy (P4 group). Release of pituitary PRL was blocked by daily treatment with bromocriptine (1 mg s.c. given at 1000 h) on Days 1-4 of pregnancy (PB group). PRL withdrawal induced functional luteolysis, as evidenced by a precipitous drop in serum progesterone to background levels. In situ 3' end-labeling of fragmented DNA (TUNEL method) also clearly showed that many apoptotic nuclei accumulated in the disintegrated luteal vessels in the corpus luteum in the PB group. Immunohistochemical studies showed that luteal Thy-1-positive vascular pericytes were abundant in the P4 group but rare in the PB group. Thus, PRL is essential for luteal vascularization in early pregnancy. Western blotting and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data showed that Fas protein and mRNA levels increased, whereas those of FasL decreased after PRL withdrawal. Accordingly, apoptosis initiated by Fas-FasL interaction is involved in the bromocriptine-induced luteolysis. Therefore, luteotropic roles of PRL are to support Thy-1 positive pericytes in maintaining proper luteal vascularization and to prevent immune insult by preserving a balance between luteal Fas and FasL expression in early pregnancy.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2002-06-25", "authors": ["Joyce CChen", "Jen-HsouLin", "Leang-ShinWu", "Yuan-FeenTsai", "Tsung HsienSu", "Chau JangChen", "Tong JChen"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod67.1.8"}

{"title": "NO-mediated chemoresistance in C6 glioma cells.", "abstract": "Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in malignant glioma and other tumors has been extensively documented. Massive production of NO by iNOS has been shown to exert tumoricidal effects. However, NO may enhance vasodilation and promote neovascularization, thereby facilitating tumor growth. Compared to the effects of NO on tumor cell death and survival, correlation between NO and cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic reagents in glioma have been less well characterized. Another gene product often linked to tumor malignancy is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a transcription factor that renders malignant tumors adaptive to hypoxic stress during massive vascularization and tumor invasion. Interestingly, HIF-1 also contributes to iNOS induction under hypoxia. We have characterized the interrelationship between iNOS, HIF-1 and chemoresistance. We note that increased NO synthesis by cytokine exposure or iNOS overexpression neutralized the cytotoxicity of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), but not cisplatin, in rat C6 glioma cells. Both BCNU and CCNU are chloroethylnitrosoureas that kill tumor cells via carbamoylating and alkylating actions. Further studies indicated that iNOS only neutralized carbamoylating action of chloroethylnitrosoureas. Expression of iNOS may inhibit HIF-1 activity under hypoxia in C6 glioma cells transfected with a VEGF promoter-driven luciferase gene. Pretreatment of C6 cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, nullified the inhibitory effect of iNOS on HIF-1 binding. That NO generated by iNOS expression inhibits HIF-1 activity in hypoxic C6 cells reveals a negative feedback loop in the HIF-1 --> iNOS cascade.

Reexpression of this embryonic signaling molecule has now been documented in naturally occurring human tumors, where it is expressed by both tumor cells and angiogenic endothelial cells, suggesting that Del1 is important in mediating angiogenesis under pathophysiological conditions in the adult. To investigate the role of Del1 in tumor growth and angiogenesis, human 143B osteosarcoma cells and murine Lewis lung carcinoma cells were engineered to express Del1 and compared to control transfectants for their ability to produce tumors in nude or syngeneic mice, respectively. Del1 expressing tumors showed a two- to fourfold increase in capillary density and an accelerated rate of growth.

The presence of human anti-pig antibodies (Abs) modulated the migration of leukocytes across porcine endothelium, as well as neutrophil adhesion to porcine endothelium under conditions of flow.

{"title": "Extracellular matrix and the blood-brain barrier in glioblastoma multiforme: spatial segregation of tenascin and agrin.", "abstract": "The quality of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), represented mainly by endothelial tight junctions (TJ), is now believed to be dependent on the brain microenvironment and influenced by the basal lamina of the microvessels. In the highly vascularized glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a dramatic increase in the permeability of blood vessels is observed but the nature of basal lamina involvement remains to be determined. Agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is a component of the basal lamina of BBB microvessels, and growing evidence suggests that it may be important for the maintenance of the BBB. In the present study, we provide first evidence that agrin is absent from basal lamina of tumor vessels if the TJ molecules occludin, claudin-5 and claudin-1 were lacking in the endothelial cells. If agrin was expressed, occludin was always localized at the TJ, claudin-5 was frequently detected, whereas claudin-1 was absent from almost all vessels. Furthermore, despite a high variability of vascular phenotypes, the loss of agrin strongly correlated with the expression of tenascin, an extracellular matrix molecule which has been described previously to be absent in mature non-pathological brain tissue and to accumulate in the basal lamina of tumor vessels. These results support the view that in human GBM, BBB breakdown is reflected by the changes of the molecular compositions of both the endothelial TJ and the basal lamina.", "journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "date": "2002-06-19", "authors": ["GesaRascher", "ArneFischmann", "StephanKr\u00f6ger", "FrankDuffner", "Ernst-HGrote", "HartwigWolburg"], "doi": "10.1007/s00401-002-0524-x"}

The dimensions of the bone defect and damage to anatomic structures of more than one type (including ulnar artery, ulnar bone, and overlying soft tissue) were the reasons for the treatment approach with a composite tissue transfer including vascularized bone. Preoperative radiographic and angiographic examination revealed that the amputation stump offered a fibular shaft with adequate length and a peroneal artery patent up to the most distal point of the bone. Instead of the usual osteocutaneous fibular harvest, flap harvest was performed in an osteomusculocutaneous manner with incorporation of a segment of soleus muscle with an overlying skin paddle. In addition to the replacement of the bone defect, transfer of the flap in a flow-through manner reestablished the dual blood supply of the hand by replacing the ulnar artery gap, whereas the muscle and skin of the flap allowed three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex defect.

Color was displayed in Power-Mode, in which the number of color pixels on the ultrasound image is related to the number of moving blood cells. Three pictures with a maximum number of color pixels of the corpus luteum (CL) during an examination period of about 20 min were selected and digitized on a laptop equipped with an external frame grabber card. The intra-class correlation coefficient for the number of color pixels was 0.90. In all estrous cycles similar patterns of changes in (C), in the cross-sectional area of sectional planes of the CL (A), and in plasma progesterone levels (P) occurred. Variance component estimates for the effect of the mare on (C), (A) and (P) were 14, 23 and 4%, for the influence of day of estrous cycle they were 41, 5 and 58% and for the effect of estrous cycle they were 7, 5 and 5%, respectively. There were high positive correlations between cyclic changes in (C) and (P) (r = 0.58; P < 0.0001). The increase in (C) between Days 0 and 5 (Day 0: ovulation) remained at high levels until Day 7 and then decreased until Day 15. There were relationships between (C) and (A) (r = 0.37; P < 0.0001) and between (A) and (P) (r = 0.24; P < 0.05), but correlation coefficients were not as high as between (C) and (P). Differences in (C), (A) and (P) between estrous cycles within mares and between mares were not related to each other (P > 0.05). The results show that transrectal color Doppler sonography is a useful, noninvasive method for examining luteal blood flow in mares, and that there are cyclic changes and individual differences in the vascularization of the CL.

{"title": "New imaging techniques in the treatment guidelines for lung cancer.", "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) remains the main imaging technique for the preoperative staging and post-therapeutic evaluation of bronchogenic carcinoma. Spiral CT has already overcome some of the problems encountered with central or more extensive tumours. Multislice CT offers further improvement and allows for scanning of the whole chest within a single breath-hold using a thin-section high-resolution technique. Problem-adapted sections in arbitrary directions become available and provide an excellent spatial resolution. One can expect improved accuracy for the evaluation of transfissural tumour growth, chest wall involvement, mediastinal infiltration and lymph node staging. Despite recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) techniques for imaging the chest, the role of MR for staging of bronchogenic carcinoma remains limited. It offers advantages such as the assessment of chest-wall involvement or mediastinal involvement in patients in whom CT remains equivocal. Lymph-node-specific MR contrast agents offer new diagnostic potential for the assessment of metastatic disease. New techniques for the display of three-dimensional data sets include volume rendering and virtual bronchoscopy. These techniques represent new tools for the evaluation and demonstration of pathology within the central tracheobronchial tree. Their most important application is the guidance of bronchoscopic biopsies. The assessment of an indeterminate pulmonary nodule is frequently based on positron emission tomography imaging. As an alternative, nodule vascularization (contrast enhancement patterns on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), calcifications (absorption characteristics at various X-ray energies on CT or dual energy radiography), and morphological features (high resolution imaging at CT) can be used as the basis for nodule differentiation. The dynamics of contrast enhancement in CT or MRI can also be used for the assessment of tumour viability after chemotherapy. Lung cancer screening programmes are still controversial.

Murine collagenase-3 (MMP-13), stromelysin (MMP-3) and gelatinases A&B (MMP-2 & -9) were expressed in prenatal hearts, as demonstrated by quantitative zymography and immunohistochemistry.

An extensive immunolabeling over the heart trabeculae, epicardial tissue and a weaker labeling in the endocardial and truncoconal cushion tissue was observed at all stages of the heart development. Utilizing quantitative zymography we found that MMP-13 activity gradually increased from ED14-ED16 reaching a plateau from ED16-ED21, while MMP-2 activity demonstrated a transient increase starting at ED13, peaked at ED16 and declined thereafter. As to MMP-9 activity, it was seen only between ED16 and ED 18.

Strong nuclear expression of HIF-1alpha protein was seen in the majority of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, particularly surrounding areas of necrosis in glioblastomas. In the majority of these tumours upregulation of HIF-1alpha mRNA was also demonstrated, with a significant increase in glioblastomas compared to lower grade tumours. No correlation was found between the presence of HIF-1alpha protein and immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein.

{"title": "Inflammatory cytokines, angiogenesis, and fibrosis in the rat peritoneum.", "abstract": "Peritonitis, a common complication of peritoneal dialysis, is followed by acute changes in the function of the peritoneum. The role of inflammatory cytokines in these processes is not clearly identified. We used adenoviral-mediated gene transfer to transiently overexpress interleukin (IL)-1 beta (AdIL-1 beta) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) in the rat peritoneum then used a modified equilibrium test to study the histological and functional changes. Overexpression of IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha led to an acute inflammatory response. Both inflammatory cytokines induced an early expression of the angiogenic cytokine, vascular endothelial growth factor, along with increased expression of the profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1, along with fibronectin expression and collagen deposition in peritoneal tissues. Both inflammatory cytokines induced angiogenesis, increased solute permeability, and ultrafiltration dysfunction at earlier time points. Changes in structure and function seen in AdTNF-alpha-treated animals returned to normal by 21 days after infection, whereas AdIL-1 beta-treated animals had persistently increased vasculature with submesothelial thickening and fibrosis. This was associated with up-regulation TIMP-1. TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta both induce acute changes in the peritoneum that mimic those seen in peritoneal dialysis patients who experience an episode of peritonitis. These functional changes were associated with early angiogenesis that resolved rapidly after exposure to TNF-alpha. IL-1 beta exposure, however, led to a different response with sustained vascularization and fibrosis.

Aortic and pulmonary HVA were dissected longitudinally into two symmetric sections by splicing of the non-coronary aortic and non-facing pulmonary cusps. Each symmetric half contained one-and-a-half valve cusps attached to the vascular wall. Fresh halves were directly fixed in formaldehyde, and analyzed immunohistochemically. The corresponding halves of the valves were decontaminated, cryopreserved, stored for at least three weeks and thereafter thawed according to the Heart Valve Bank protocol before analysis.\nActivated endothelial cells, expressing PECAM-1 (CD31), VCAM-1 and HLA class II molecules covered at least 50% of fresh valvular surfaces. A comprehensive vascular network was found in the myocardial rim and adventitial layer, which was covered entirely by activated endothelial cells. HLA class II-positive macrophages (CD68) and T lymphocytes (CD3) were found scattered in the stroma and subendothelial layer of the valve leaflets.

Aortic valve allografts harbor more mononuclear cells than their pulmonary counterparts.

The ratio of malignant melanomas (10.78 +/- 9.18) is significantly higher than these of melanoma metastases (4.20 +/- 1.66), basal cell carcinomas (3.24 +/- 1.32) and dysplastic nevi (2.85 +/- 1.32).\nThe high resolution LDPI has the potential to be a non-invasive screening method for preoperative differential diagnosis of pigmented skin tumours. Besides the epiluminescence microscopy and sonographic determination of the tumour thickness, we have now the possibility to get preoperative information about tumour vascularization.", "journal": "Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete", "date": "2002-06-11", "authors": ["MSt\u00fccker", "MHoffmann", "UMemmel", "Cvon Bormann", "KHoffmann", "PAltmeyer"], "doi": "10.1007/s00105-002-0338-8"}

Ablation of beta8 results in embryonic or perinatal lethality with profound defects in vascular development. Sixty-five percent of integrin beta8-deficient embryos die at midgestation, with evidence of insufficient vascularization of the placenta and yolk sac. The remaining 35% die shortly after birth with extensive intracerebral hemorrhage. Examination of brain tissue from integrin beta8-deficient embryos reveals abnormal vascular morphogenesis resulting in distended and leaky capillary vessels, as well as aberrant brain capillary patterning. In addition, endothelial cell hyperplasia is found in these mutant brains. Expression studies show that integrin beta8 transcripts are localized in endodermal cells surrounding endothelium in the yolk sac and in periventricular cells of the neuroepithelium in the brain. We propose that integrin beta8 is required for vascular morphogenesis by providing proper cues for capillary growth in both yolk sac and embryonic brain.

The premenopause group (58 women) had menstruated within the last 3 months and had normal ovaries (no polycystic ovary or any pathologic cyst or mass), as demonstrated on the baseline ultrasound (US) examination. The perimenopause group (20 women) had last menstruated between 3 and 12 months earlier and had normal ovaries. The postmenopause group (22 women) had had no menstrual cycle within the last 12 months and had normal ovaries. Three-dimensional power Doppler US was applied to quantify the blood flow and vascularization within the stroma of the bilateral ovaries.

SCLC is rarely treated by surgery, as a consequence, few specimens are available to perform a biological characterization. We reviewed our experience in the surgical treatment of SCLC with particular reference to the angiogenetic expression and its correlation to the stage of disease and prognosis.\nWe retrospectively investigated a homogenous cohort of 87 patients with SCLC, who were primarily operated on and then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy between 1980 and 1998. Their median age was 62 years (range 34-73). All the patients were completely staged. The surgical procedures included: 32 pneumonectomies and 55 lobectomies. There were 46 N0, 17 N1 and 24 N2-disease. The adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of four to six courses of cyclophosphamide, epidoxorubicine and etoposide. The MVC was determined highlighting the microvessels with anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies. Immunostaining for VEGF was performed using the ABC method with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies. The p53 protein expression was assessed by NCL-DO7 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody.\nWith a median follow-up of 109.6 months (range 25-238), 37 patients are alive and well, two are alive with systemic metastases. Forty-four patients died of local (n=5) or systemic (n=39) relapse, while four patients died from other causes. The median MVC was 59 (range 18-145). Among the clinico-pathological parameters, metastatic nodal-involvement (P=0.002) and advanced stage of disease (P=0.005) were associated with a worse overall survival (OS). MVC and VEGF protein expression significantly affected the survival (P<0.001 and P=0.0008, respectively). No statistical association was found between p53 alterations and OS as well as no association was found among p53 alterations, MVC and VEGF expression. On multivariate analysis only the VEGF expression (P=0.003) was an independent prognostic factor.\nAngiogenesis plays a role in the metastatic process of the SCLC as well as NSCLC. SCLC has a higher vascularization than NSCLC as results from the higher number of microvessels; however, tumor angiogenesis tested by the MVC and the VEGF protein expression correlates with the prognosis also in SCLC.

Histologically, they were well circumscribed and lobulated. The lobules were separated by thin fibroconnective tissue septa and were composed of slender spindle cells showing slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct boundaries, uniform nuclei with finely granular chromatin, and no nucleoli. The cells were embedded in a richly myxoid stroma. The background in all three tumours was a 'chicken-wire', capillary vascular network resembling that seen in myxoid liposarcomas. Two tumours had scattered signet-ring-type lipoblasts and the third a large number of such lipoblasts. Clusters of mature adipocytes were entrapped in the tumours. None had mitotic figures, necrosis, or pleomorphism. The neoplastic cells stained positively for vimentin and were negative for other immunohistochemical markers. Treatment for all three tumours was enucleation alone. After follow-up of 10 years, 7 years, and 1 year, all patients are well with no evidence of disease.\nThe benign behaviour of these neoplasms militates against the diagnosis of liposarcoma.

Forty-five cases of DCIS were analyzed for image analysis: nuclear area, DNA ploidy, and vascularization in order to establish a more precise correlation between the histologic grade and these morphometric parameters. Our results confirm that the mean nuclear area, DNA ploidy, and microvessel density (MVD) progressively increased from DCIS grade I to DCIS grade III. The analysis of the nuclear area in relationship to DCIS grading demonstrated a progressive increase of values between grades I/II to grade III, but these data have no statistical significance. An analysis of DNA ploidy demonstrated significant differences between grades I/III (p < 0.05), but there was no statistical significance between grades I/II, grades II/III, or both (p > 0.005). The analysis of MVD was extremely significant between grades I/III (p < 0.001) and grades II/III (p < 0.001), but between grades I/II, these values showed no significant differences (p > 0.05). Based on this study, it can be concluded that image analysis techniques confirm how DCIS presents morphometric values that increase from DCIS grade I to DCIS grade III and that within this spectrum, DCIS grade III can be identified as a group of tumors presenting a large nuclear area, aneuploid DNA, and abundant vascular neogenesis, confirming that this neoplasm displays more aggressive patterns than the other two types.

Six patients showed multiple (two to five) tumors. Tumor size ranged from 1 to 7 cm (mean 3.6 +/- 1.4 cm). Twelve patients suffered from hereditary diseases. Seven patients had bilateral adrenal diseases; in three patients pheochromocytomas were removed on both sides synchronously. Four neoplasias were local recurrences (three pheochromocytomas, one paraganglioma). The laparoscopic route was chosen for six operations, and the retroperitoneoscopic technique was performed in 49 procedures. Partial adrenalectomy was performed in 19 operations (in all patients with bilateral diseases). High-dosage a-blockage with phenoxybenzamine was routinely used. There were no conversions to open surgery. Perioperative complications were minor (23%), and mortality was zero.

Bony reconstruction was achieved in 57 of the 60 cases; however, various postoperative complications occurred in 54 percent of the cases. One case of arterial thrombosis of an anastomosed vessel and nine cases of venous congestion of the monitoring flap occurred in the early postoperative periods. The authors managed the nine cases of venous congestion of the flap conservatively, and all flaps survived. Partial necrosis of the flap was noted in eight of these nine cases, but additional surgical intervention was required in only four cases. Treatment included a gastrocnemius musculocutaneous flap in one case and a full-thickness skin graft in three cases. The vascularized fibula survived and bony fusion was achieved in all of these cases. The one case of arterial thrombosis resulted in graft failure due to a delay in the decision to perform a thrombectomy. Graft fracture occurred in 13 cases as the mechanical stress to the graft increased. In two cases of femoral reconstruction, graft fracture occurred during dynamization of the graft, despite the use of an Ilizarov external fixator.

Several lines of evidence indicate a role for PlGF in monocyte chemotaxis and in potentiating the activity of VEGF, but the exact function of this cytokine is not fully understood. To define the biological role of PlGF in vivo, we have produced a transgenic mouse model overexpressing this factor in the skin by using a keratin 14 promoter cassette. Our data indicate that PlGF has strong angiogenic properties in both fetal and adult life. PlGF overexpression results in a substantial increase in the number, branching and size of dermal blood vessels as well as in enhanced vascular permeability. Indeed, intradermally injected recombinant PlGF was able to induce vessel permeability in wild-type mice.

{"title": "Origins of follicular cells and ontogeny of steroidogenesis in ovine fetal ovaries.", "abstract": "Using fetal sheep as the experimental model, we have elucidated some of the key events that culminate in the formation of primordial follicles. A special effort was made to determine the source of the somatic cells that ultimately become granulosa cells of primordial follicles. Between gestational days 38-100: (1) light and electron microscopy was used to characterize changes in ovarian histoarchitecture; (2) incorporation of BrdU was used to identify populations of proliferating cells within fetal ovaries before, during and after, follicular formation; and (3) in situ hybridisation was used to determine the cell-specific and temporal patterns of expression of mRNAs encoding for selected steroidogenic enzymes. At day 38 somatic (pregranulosa) cells were in contact with oogonia and easily distinguished from endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Between days 38 and 45, pregranulosa cell-oogonia complexes progressively coalesced to form 'tube-like' structures referred to as ovigerous cords. These cords consisted of pregranulosa cells and oogonia arranged such that pregranulosa cells formed the outer wall of the cords. Ovigerous cords were avascular, enveloped in a prominent basal lamina, open-ended where they interfaced with the ovarian surface epithelium, and formed a separate compartment whereby oogonia/oocytes were segregated from the surrounding stroma and vasculature until the time of follicular formation. The structural integrity of ovigerous cords was maintained through day 75, at which time primordial follicles (type 1 and type 1a) first emerged from the cords at the interface of the cortex and medulla. On the basis of the sequential structural changes that occurred during the differentiation and development of fetal ovaries and location of proliferating cells identified by the incorporation of BrdU, we conclude that the majority of the granulosa cells in primordial follicles are derived from mesothelial cells originating from the ovarian surface epithelium. In addition, from the cell-specific distribution and temporal pattern of expression of mRNAs for key steroidogenic enzymes we hypothesize that steroid hormones may play a pivotal paracrine/autocrine role in the formation and/or function of ovigerous cords as well as the development of the ovarian vascular network.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular endocrinology", "date": "2002-06-05", "authors": ["Jennifer LJuengel", "Heywood RSawyer", "Peter RSmith", "Laurel DQuirke", "Derek AHeath", "StanLun", "St JohnWakefield", "Kenneth PMcNatty"], "doi": "10.1016/s0303-7207(02)00045-x"}

First, we examined murine FL5.12 cells transfected with the bcr-abl constructs p185, p210 and p230 and found that the transfected cells secreted as much as four-fold more VEGF (p185 > p210 >p230) than wild-type (wt) cells, as well as MMP-9 and MMP-2. When Matrigel fragments containing these bcr-abl+ cells were implanted subcutaneously in SCID or Balb-C mice they became significantly more vascularized and hemoglobinized than implants containing normal or wt cells (p185 > p210 > p230). Similarly, we found that myeloblasts expanded from bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells derived from Philadelphia-positive CML patients secreted up to 10 times more VEGF, FGF-2, HGF and IL-8 compared to myeloblasts derived from normal donors' BM CD34+ cells and that BM mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from CML patients induced vascularization of Matrigel implants in mice. Moreover, we found that peripheral blood MNC expressed MMP-2 and membrane-type (MT)1-MMP in about 50% of CML patients studied, and MMP-9 in all of them. Furthermore, VEGF stimulated the secretion of MMP-9 in these primary CML cells.

Spontaneous resorption of herniated disc (HD) is frrequently detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Marked infiltration by macrophages and neo-vascularization are observed upon histogical examination of HD. In addition, enhanced MRI studies suggest that HD resorption occurs more frequently in those completely exposed to the epidural space and that this correlates with their degree of vascularization. We have postulated that the angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), may be implicated in the neo-vascularization of HD tissues. Here we demonstrate that VEGF and its receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed in human surgical samples of HD. Using a co-culture system comprised of murine peritoneal macrophages and intervertebral disc tissue as a model of the acute phase of HD developed previously, an increase in macrophage VEGF protein and mRNA expression was observed upon exposure to disc tissue. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was required for this induction of VEGF. Use of a novel angiogenesis assay revealed that addition of the conditioned media from the co-culture system resulted in an increase of vascular tubule formation. This effect was strongly inhibited by anti-VEGF antibody, but augmented by recombinant VEGF.

Furthermore, the relation of birth weight to various placental traits and the relations between placental traits were evaluated relative to ESR genotype. For this study, 62 Large White x Meishan F2 crossbred gilts (18 AA, 24 AB, and 20 BB) were used. The gilts belonged to a population in which the A allele is favorable for litter size. ESRp nested within ESRm did not affect placental length, weight, surface area and number of areolae. ESRp nested within ESRm affected amnion weight (AA-AA amnions were heavier than AA-AB, AB-AA and BB-AB amnions), placental weight after including placental surface area in the model (AA-AB placentae were lighter than AA-AA, AB-BB and BB-AB placentae), placental efficiency calculated as birth weight divided by placental weight (AB-AA placentae were less efficient than AA-AB placentae), and the relations of birth weight to placental weight and birth weight to number of areolae. The found differences imply an interaction of maternal and fetal ESR genotype on placental traits (especially weight and number of areolae) during fetal development. Furthermore, the found effects on placental and amnion weight might be the result of a difference in thickness or vascularization or both. The favorable ESR allele for litter size, i.e. the A allele, appears to be the unfavorable allele for pre-weaning piglet growth. Therefore, further research on ESR in relation to vascularization, weight and thickness of placentae. uterine size, endometrial gland development, and piglet growth is recommended.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2002-05-31", "authors": ["Birgitte T T Mvan Rens", "Tettevan der Lende"], "doi": "10.1016/s0093-691x(02)00672-6"}

AH was induced in Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DSS) with a salt diet and in Wistar-Kyoto rats by inhibiting NO formation with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (NNA). Three weeks after induction of AH, two wound chambers containing collagen I (Vitrogen) were sutured into the mesenteric cavity of each animal. After additional 14 days, wound chamber neovascularization and the extent of vascularized connective tissue ingrowth were quantified. In NNA-induced AH, the number of newly formed vessels and the ingrowth of vascularized connective tissue into the wound chamber decreased as compared to controls. However, the number of newly formed vessels and the ingrowth of vascularized connective tissue did not change with increasing blood pressure in salt-fed DSS rats as compared to those fed a normal diet.

A morphologic study was performed with a 20-MHz probe. The maximal thickness of tumors was measured and compared with the Breslow index. A color Doppler sonographic analysis of neovascularization was performed with a 13-MHz probe to depict intratumoral vessels.\nOf the 69 melanomas, 65 were depicted on sonography. Tumor thickness ranged from 0.26 to 8.0 mm as measured by sonography and from 0.15 to 8.0 mm according to the Breslow index. Sonographic measurements correlated strongly with the Breslow index (r > 0.96). Surgical reexcision was necessary in 33 tumors with a Breslow index exceeding 1 mm, but reexcision could have been avoided in 31 of these cases had the initial surgical planning been based on high-frequency sonographic measurements. Among the 62 patients studied with color Doppler sonography, intratumoral vessels were depicted on color Doppler sonography in 21 melanomas, all of which were thicker than 2 mm. The median follow-up was 40 months. Eleven patients developed metastases, and all except one had a vascularized melanoma. In the univariate analyses, neovascularization visualized with sonography and the Breslow index were both significantly linked to the occurrence of metastases (p < 0.0001).

We used gray-scale sonography to identify calcifications, to evaluate the borders of the lesions to determine whether they were poorly defined or well defined, and to determine the echogenicity relative to the surrounding soft tissue. Doppler sonography served to determine the number of vessels per square centimeter and the peak arterial Doppler shift.

{"title": "Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 is a tonic suppressor of vascularization.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is regulated by means of a balance between activators and inhibitors. However, little is known regarding the regulation of the quiescent state of adult vessels. Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) is found in both endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the vasculature, where its function has remained elusive. We have investigated the role of CRFR2 as a determinant of tissue vascularization by comparing control and CRFR2-deficient mice with immunohistological and morphometric techniques. To define the mechanisms responsible for CRFR2 inhibition of angiogenesis, we have also examined in vitro the effect of ligand activation on cell proliferation, cell cycle protein phosphorylation, and capillary tube formation. Our results demonstrate that mice deficient for CRFR2 become hypervascularized postnatally. Activation of this receptor in vitro results in reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release from SMCs, an inhibition of SMC proliferation, and inhibition of capillary tube formation in collagen gels. Treatment of a subcutaneously injected gel matrix with a CRFR2 agonist inhibits growth factor-induced vascularization. Western blots show that cell cycle retinoblastoma protein, which is essential for cell cycle progression, is decreased by CRFR2 agonist treatment in SMCs. These results suggest that CRFR2 is a critical component of a pathway necessary for tonic inhibition of adult neovascularization.

Retinal vessel morphology was evaluated by digital image analysis of ocular fundus photographs in 47 subjects, aged 23-30 y. The women were allocated into three groups: 1) those born preterm and appropriate for gestational age (AGA), with a median gestational age at birth of 30 wk and a median birth weight of 1250 g (n = 14); 2) those born small for gestational age (SGA) but full term (median 40 wk), with a median birth weight of 2130 g (n = 17), and 3) those born full term, AGA, and with a median birth weight of 3640 g (n = 16). Women born preterm had significantly higher length index for arterioles compared with the other two groups (median 1.11 and 1.08, respectively, p = 0.005). In addition, the preterm-born women had significantly fewer number of vascular branching points compared with the controls (median 27 and 30, respectively, p = 0.03). The abnormal retinal vascularization observed in ex-preterm women together with an increased casual blood pressure observed in these subjects suggests that being born preterm does have effects on the vascular system that persist into adult life.

The heparanase enzyme is preferentially expressed in human tumours and its overexpression in low-metastatic tumour cells confers a highly invasive phenotype in experimental animals. Heparanase also releases angiogenic factors and accessory fragments of HS from the tumour microenvironment and induces an angiogenic response in vivo. Heparanase may thus facilitate tumour cell invasion, vascularization and survival in a given microenvironment, all critical events in cancer progression.

Adenoviral delivery of the TIMP-3 gene to human melanoma (A2058) and SCC (UT-SCC-7) cells ex vivo inhibited tumorigenesis after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of the infected cells into SCID/SCID mice. Three daily consecutive intratumoral injections of 1.4x10(9) plaque-forming units (pfu) of TIMP-3 adenovirus (RAdTIMP-3) inhibited the growth of preestablished melanoma and SCC xenografts in SCID/SCID mice, whereas growth of control virus-injected tumors was not affected. The antitumor effect of RAdTIMP-3 was obtained with in vivo adenoviral transduction efficiency of 8-10%, and it was more potent than that of adenovirally delivered p53. Adenovirusmediated expression of TIMP-3 potently reduced gelatinolytic activity, increased the number of apoptotic cells, and inhibited vascularization of melanomas. Escalation of the adenoviral dose to three rounds of three daily consecutive injections with 1.4x10(9) pfu of RAdTIMP-3 every 6 days entirely inhibited growth of injected melanomas for 32 days. Mixing RAdTIMP-3-infected A2058 cells with uninfected cells in 1:1 ratio in culture resulted in death of all cells in 96 hours. Adenovirally delivered TIMP-3 was also expressed by A2058 cells in soluble form into the culture medium, where it exerted a cytotoxic effect on uninfected A2058 cell cultures after relocating to the cell layer.

Apart from neovascularization, ischemic proliferative retinopathy leads to retinal degeneration. Apoptosis has been ascribed to be the leading mechanism in ischemic retinal degeneration. We showed recently that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in the avascular retina in proliferative retinopathy in vivo and that iNOS expression in retinal glial cells is responsible for retinal neuronal cell death in vitro. Here we show that retinal apoptosis and subsequent degeneration occur in the murine model of ischemic proliferative retinopathy. Furthermore, because NO can have beneficial or detrimental effects in the retina, we analyzed the role of iNOS on retinal apoptosis in ischemic proliferative retinopathy. Using iNOS knock-out mice and iNOS inhibitor 1400W, we demonstrate in vivo that iNOS expression induces apoptosis locally in the inner nuclear layer of the avascular retina and that protein nitration may be involved in this process. These findings are the first evidence for retinal apoptosis in an animal model of ischemic proliferative retinopathy, demonstrating that iNOS plays a crucial role not only in retinal neovascular disease but also in retinal degeneration.

{"title": "Rescue of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-deficient tumor growth by wild-type cells is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor.", "abstract": "In tumors, rapid cell proliferation associated with deficient vascularization leads to areas of hypoxia. Tumor hypoxia has direct consequences on clinical and prognostic parameters and is a potential therapeutic target. The hypoxic response depends critically on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in pathological (e.g., tumorigenesis) as well as physiological (e.g., development and wound healing) processes. By s.c. injection of HIF-1alpha(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells in nude mice, we were able to demonstrate the role of HIF-1alpha in cell differentiation of teratocarcinomas. HIF-1alpha(+/+) tumors grow fast and preferentially form neuronal tissue, whereas HIF-1alpha(-/-) tumors show delayed growth and favorably form mesenchyme-derived tissue. Mixing wild-type and HIF-1alpha(-/-) ES cells in the same tumor at a ratio as low as 1:100, we showed that HIF-1alpha(+/+) cells can rescue the growth of mixed tumors although these tumors are not significantly different phenotypically or genotypically from the original HIF-1alpha(-/-) tumors. Interestingly, these results are not restricted to teratocarcinomas: they were confirmed with mixtures of Hepa1/Hepa1C4 cells (where HIF-1beta is mutated), demonstrating that growth changes are not related to differences in differentiation observed within teratocarcinomas. We also showed that despite lower mRNA expression, vascular endothelial growth factor protein status in HIF-1alpha(-/-) and mixed tumors does not significantly differ from the HIF-1alpha(+/+) tumors. Moreover, we demonstrated that tumor vascularization remains proportional to vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels, but that hypoxic up-regulation of this growth factor is not the decisive factor influencing tumor growth. Differences in levels of apoptosis are not responsible for alteration in growth because poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, a hallmark of the apoptotic process, was similar in HIF-1alpha(+/+), HIF-1alpha(-/-), and mixed tumors. Our data demonstrate that the HIF-1alpha-dependent response of a few cells is capable of sustaining the growth of the whole tumor, probably through the secretion of factors up-regulated under low oxygen conditions.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-05-23", "authors": ["GiseleH\u00f6pfl", "Roland HWenger", "UrsZiegler", "ThomasStallmach", "OlivierGardelle", "RogerAchermann", "MelanieWergin", "BarbaraKaser-Hotz", "H MarkSaunders", "Kaye JWilliams", "Ian JStratford", "MaxGassmann", "IsabelleDesbaillets"], "doi": null}

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected i.p. with 50 mg 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)/kg body weight at 21 days of age. Tumor-bearing rats were killed 35 days post-carcinogen. Immunohistochemical detection of blood vessels using antiserum directed against the CD31 epitope was performed on paraffin sections of 36 carcinomas representing four histological types. Census counting was used to detect all blood vessels that were subsequently divided into one of five vessel size categories. Vessels were counted in both the intra-tumoral region and in a 50 microm width band of mammary tissue circumscribing each tumor; the circumscribed area was referred to as the extra-tumoral region. Vascular density was reported in units of vessel counts or vessel area per unit of assessed area. Overall, vascular density was observed to be highly variable and was not affected by tumor histology. Vascular density in the extra-tumoral region was significantly higher than in the intra-tumoral region. Correlation analyses indicated that similar information was obtained when vascular density was reported as either vessel counts or vessel area; however, correlations across vessel size categories and between the intra-tumoral and extra-tumoral regions were low and generally not statistically significant. Collectively, the data provide a complete description of vascularization in autochthonously growing mammary tumors, and a reference for comparison in studies of various cancer preventive agents that modulate the angiogenic process.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2002-05-23", "authors": ["Henry JThompson", "John NMcGinley", "Katrina KKnott", "Nicole SSpoelstra", "PamelaWolfe"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/23.5.847"}

However, skin allografts in rats which simultaneously received vascularized limb allografts were rejected more slowly. In this study, the authors examined the reasons why vascularized limb allografts have the ability to induce immunologic tolerance. For investigating which tissue components provide such tolerance, they compared the mean survival times (MST) of skin allografts on the backs of rats (used as an indicator of rejection), which were simultaneously engrafted with vascularized skin allografts, muscle allografts, joint allografts, and limb allografts. In the cases of limb allografts (MST=32.1 days) (these allografts contain bone-marrow cells), the skin allografts survived longer than vascularized skin allografts (MST=23.6 days) or muscle allografts (MST=22.6 days). For ascertaining whether the ability to induce immunologic tolerance of limb allografts was due to bone-marrow cells or not, the authors compared the MST of skin allografts in rats that were simultaneously engrafted with non-irradiated limb allografts, irradiated limb allografts, and bone-marrow cells. The allografted skin in the rats that received non-irradiated limbs (MST=32.1 days) survived longer than irradiated limb allografts (MST=20.3 days) and bone-marrow cells (MST=18.4 days).

{"title": "Prefabrication of a free peripheral nerve graft following implantation on an arteriovenous pedicle.", "abstract": "Extensive nerve injuries frequently necessitate the use of long autografts, and sources of expendable donor nerves are limited. It is for these cases that nerve transplantation would have its greatest potential. However, regeneration in the rejected allograft fails because of a lack of the positive neurotropic and neurotrophic influences physiologically provided by viable Schwann cells. This report aims to show the feasibility of vascularization of the peripheral nerve by prefabrication. The study was designed to vascularize an autogenous nerve graft segment by using an arteriovenous bundle in the rabbit. A 3.5-cm segment of sciatic nerve was harvested and implanted in between the femoral vessels, and was isolated from secondary revascularization by a custom-made tube. A peripheral nerve graft was prefabricated by implantation on the vascular pedicle, and neovascularization was evaluated by microangiography and histology. The graft exhibited early neovascularization on day 2, and numerous new capillaries were noted to restore primarily perineurial blood flow on day 7, then all along the graft on day 14. The viability of the Schwann cells was preserved, and the structural integrity of the graft was maintained. This is a preliminary report on secondary vascularization of a segment of an autogenous nerve to maintain the viability of Schwann cells and the integrity of the conduit. In the future, with the concomitant use of host immunosuppression or with more advanced pre-treatment methods, nerve allografts could be revascularized by vascular bundles. The current tempo of medical research will hopefully enable the use of fresh nerve allografts that are rendered less immunogenic by more refined techniques.", "journal": "Journal of reconstructive microsurgery", "date": "2002-05-22", "authors": ["AydinSaray", "AliTeoman Tellioglu", "GulcinAltinok"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2002-30184"}

The authors present the transfer of the free fascia temporalis into the wrist as a treatment of wrist ankylosis in patients affected by severe rheumatoid arthritis. Four flaps in three patients were performed. Preoperative flexion/extension in the wrist was absent or almost absent and painful, resulting in severely impaired daily activities. After resection of the distal ulna, distal radius, and the proximal surfaces of the proximal row of the carpal bones was performed, the free fascia was used to replace the wrist joint. Postoperative wrist flexion/extension was 45 to 50 degrees on average. In all patients, this procedure allowed painless motion of the wrist, and in all patients, daily activities were improved. A 2-year follow up showed no recurrence of wrist problems and a maintained articular space.

{"title": "Angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation precede formation of recurrent tumors after radiation therapy in nude mice.", "abstract": "Recently, the combination of ionizing radiation with inhibitors of angiogenesis has been reported to improve tumor eradication compared to treatment with irradiation alone. However, the mechanisms of this effect have not been defined. For this purpose [corrected] we established a non-small cell lung cancer model in nude mice. Tumor vascularization was visualized in vivo by MRI using gadolinium-DTPA as contrast agent. Further, cryosections were produced as close as possible to the MRI slice positions. Since we were interested in examining the formation of a recurrent tumor, irradiation was performed with a single fraction of 4 Gy. This dose caused a partial remission followed by recurrent tumor growth 25 to 35 days after therapy. The process of partial remission as well as formation of the recurrent tumor was examined in 28 nude mice analysing the following parameters: (i) contrast agent enhancement using high-resolution MRI, (ii) proliferation of tumor cells and fibroblasts using Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and (iii) formation of microvessels using CD31 immunohistochemistry. The latter analyses led to differentiation of three stages. Stage 1 (day 1 to day 15 after irradiation) was characterized by increasing areas of dead cell mass in hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides that corresponded to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation as well as contrast agent enhancement in MRI. The percentage of Ki-67-positive tumor cells decreased from initially 45.1% +/- 6.0% (mean +/- standard deviation) to 1.4% +/- 1.2% (mean +/- standard deviation) on day 15. Stage 2 (day 6 to day 20 after irradiation; overlapping with stage 1) was characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts leading to formation of fibrotic septae with abundant microvessels. Already during late stage 2, MRI identified new contrast agent enhancing areas. Stage 3 (day 20 to day 40 after irradiation) was characterized by new tumor cell proliferation. Interestingly, tumor cells almost exclusively proliferated in the direct neighbourhood of the fibrotic septae that had been formed in stage 2. Obviously, proliferation of fibroblasts and blood vessels was a condition prior to formation of recurrent tumor tissue. Thus, our results are in contrast with the view that tumors or recurrent tumors begin as avascular masses that later induce neovascularization. With respect to clinical practice, our results suggest that: (i) adjuvant anti-angiogenic therapy should not be limited to the day of irradiation but should cover a critical period until day 5 to day 20 after radiotherapy, (ii) adjuvant therapy should also include inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and (iii) MRI can identify a recurrent tumor 10 to 15 days before occurrence of new tumor growth.", "journal": "Anticancer research", "date": "2002-05-17", "authors": ["JHast", "I BSchiffer", "BNeugebauer", "ETeichman", "WSchreiber", "JBrieger", "D WKim", "SGebhard", "C JBorn", "MStrugala", "JSagem\u00fcller", "WBrenner", "W JMann", "FOesch", "MThelen", "J GHengstler"], "doi": null}

Silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) is an important predictor of adverse outcome in patients with proven coronary artery disease. beta-blockers are effective in suppressing ischemia, and improve clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease. At present, it is common practice to stop treatment with beta-blockers in clinically asymptomatic patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or myocardial re-vascularization (PTCA/Stent), although the possible presence of SMI/inducible ischemia after myocardial re-vascularization is not known. We examined 56 asymptomatic CHD patients after coronary artery bypass graft (n=36), percutaneous coronary angioplasty PTCA/stent (n=15), or both (n=5); therapy with beta-blockers was stopped in all of them after myocardial revascularization. All these patients underwent a dobutamine stress echocardiography test (DSE test). The DSE test was proposed to these asymptomatic CHD patients to investigate the possible presence of SMI/inducible ischemia after myocardial re-vascularization. All patients had history of myocardial infarction or evidence of mildly impaired left ventricular function at rest as assessed by cardiac catheterization. Abnormal DSE studies occurred in eight of the 56 patients (14%; 95% C.I.: 6-26%). Therapeutic approaches specifically targeted at reducing total ischaemic burden include pharmacologic therapy and myocardial revascularization. On the basis of these data, it can be concluded that asymptomatic CHD patients after myocardial re-vascularization must be re-evaluated to rule out SMI/inducible ischemia that can be treated (e.g. with beta-blockers) reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2002-05-15", "authors": ["FerruccioDe Lorenzo", "NeelamSaba", "MarkDancy", "Vijay VirKakkar", "ZbigniewKadziola", "Han BXiao"], "doi": "10.1016/s0167-5273(02)00029-3"}

The prevalence of this proximal arterial supply is largely unknown. The authors report a large anatomic study (n = 56), together with two clinical cases, to assess the incidence and potential suitability of the sural nerve as a vascularized nerve graft. Dissections were performed on 6 fresh cadavers injected with Microfil dye and on 22 preserved cadavers. The superficial sural artery was present in 91 percent of the dissections. The mean diameter of this extrinsic artery was 1.5 mm. The mean percentage of neural tissue within the sural nerve in the region where it is supplied by the superficial sural artery was 62 percent compared to 34 percent distally, where it was supplied by the posterior tibial and fibular (peroneal) arteries. This anatomic difference provides a solid rationale for preferential utilization of the proximal portion of the nerve, as opposed to its distal segment.

{"title": "[Inhibitation of tumor angiogenesis, growth and metastasis by blocking VEGF paracrine pathway].", "abstract": "Solid tumors require an adequate vascular supply to grow beyond a certain dimension. It is known that formation of new blood vessels in tumor is mediated by unbalanced expression of angiogenic factors and their inhibitors. Among the former, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been assumed prime candidacy as a major positive physiological effector. To investigate the role of VEGF in angiogenesis associated with development of breast cancer, a sense VEGF and an anti-sense VEGF expression plasmids were constructed, and then were introduced into a human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, expressing middle level of endogenous VEGF. Anti-sense VEGF(121) transfected MCF-7 cells that expressed reduced constitutive levels of VEGF and showed the same growing potential as untransfected MCF-7 cells in vitro, but it showed longer latency, smaller tumor, slower growth and prolonged survival time compared to parental or sense VEGF(165) transfected MCF-7 cells in vivo. Moreover, the tumors derived from anti-sense VEGF(121) transfected MCF-7 cells characterized by minimal vascularization and extensive necrosis. Finally, mice with primary subcutaneous tumors treated with intratumoral administration of anti-sense VEGF, or the plasmid expressing extracellular domain of the Flk-1 VEGF receptor (sFlk-1) followed by electroporation, showed significant tumor suppression. These results suggest that VEGF plays a major angiogenic role in breast cancer and a strategy, which blocks the VEGF paracrine pathway, may provide a means to control tumor growth topically without the risk of systemic antiangiogenesis.", "journal": "Sheng wu hua xue yu sheng wu wu li xue bao Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "date": "2002-05-15", "authors": ["FengWang", "Yu-HuaTian", "LiLi", "Xia-FangChen", "Hong-HuiHu", "Chuan-YuanLi", "QianHuang"], "doi": null}

It is a quick and easy examination that takes less than 5 minutes to perform and produces high-quality images with use of a dedicated surface coil that provides a high signal-to-noise ratio, allowing small pixel size and high spatial resolution. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography requires intravenous injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine and acquisition of a volumetric slab of image data from the hand. This information is then projected with a maximum-intensity-projection algorithm. The technique is generally robust with reproducible findings. Image interpretation requires an understanding of (a) the normal vascular anatomy and anatomic variants of the hand and (b) common vascular diseases.

{"title": "Persistence of neoangiogenesis and cardiomyocyte divisions in right ventricular myocardium of rats born and raised in hypoxic conditions.", "abstract": "Effects of chronic hypoxia on capillary and myocyte growth were examined in rats born and raised in a low pressure chamber (equivalent of 3500 m a.s.l.). The animals were sacrificed at the age of 3 months and their hearts were used to study right ventricular growth and vascularization. The results of our cytological and morphometric analysis suggest the persistence of capillary neogenesis in this particular model of cardiac hypertrophy. Under the optical microscope, we observed significant changes in capillary spatial patterns such as the presence of sinusoids and irregular capillary sprouts. This resulted in a significant shortening of the effective diffusion distance and in a slight decrease in the calculated diameter of the Krogh cylinder. Concomitant to the remodeling of the terminal capillary network, the right ventricular myocardium of hypoxic rats exhibited peculiar changes in myocyte cytology. The principal alteration consisted in the ectopic subsarcolemmal location of some of muscle cell nuclei which appeared enlarged and rounded, sometimes irregularly folded. At the E. M. level, they presented chromatine condensation, nucleolemmal folding and, occasionally, nuclear splitting. Irregular chromatin densifications at the equatorial position were also encountered but we never observed nucleolemmal dissolution or typical metaphase plaques which excludes the presence of mitotic division. Some of the marginalized nuclei were progressively excluded from original binucleate cells into small cytoplasmic processes that invaded the adjacent neo-formed pericapillar spaces and gave rise to small well-organized cardiomyocytes. This apparent fragmentation of cardiomyocytes may evoke the description of the apoptotic process which is believed to be stimulated in hypoxic tissues. However, we could not confirm that myocyte fragmentation that we describe is followed by shrinkage necrosis or by any mobilization of adjacent resident cells. Nuclear exclusions into pericapillary myocyte sprouts may, therefore, reflect amitotic divisions of polyploid cardiomyocytes which contribute to the persistence of hyperplasic growth in right ventricular myocardium in hearts of rats exposed to chronic hypoxia during their early postnatal life. Par analogie with our data, it can be expected that an appropriate stimulation of angiogenesis in hearts of adult animals attenuates some of cytological and functional drawbacks that accompany hypertrophic cardiomyopathies of other etiologies.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2002-05-11", "authors": ["MireilleMoravec", "ZdenekTurek", "JosefMoravec"], "doi": "10.1007/s003950200006"}

The umbilical artery resistance index, pulsatility index and systolic to diastolic ratio were measured in each case. The vessels were quantified by a stereological method described previously and vascular surface density and the volume portion of the villi were calculated. The placentas of preterm and term cases with intrauterine growth restriction displayed significant reductions in the vascular surface density of stem and intermediate/terminal villi and volume portion of intermediate/terminal villi stroma when compared with gestation-matched normally grown cases (p<0.05). There was no significant correlation between Doppler index values of the umbilical artery and the stereological parameters of the intermediate/terminal and stem villi in the intrauterine growth restriction group (p>0.05). Some of the pregnancies with intrauterine growth restriction (six patients) with normal Doppler flow velocity waveforms had reduced vascularization in the placentas, and these pregnancies were found to have no perinatal complications.

The study consisted of two phases: prelamination and expansion of the flap, and vascularized free-tissue transfer of the flap. Six adult mongrel dogs were used. First, a 5 x 10-cm flap based on the saphenous vessels was elevated on the lower leg, and then four 1 x 2-cm pieces of mucosa harvested from the tongue were grafted onto the undersurface of the flap. A tissue expander (5 x 10 cm) was then placed under the flap, and the incision was closed primarily. The expanders were initially filled with just enough normal saline to obliterate dead space immediately after surgery. The expansion was continued twice weekly for 3 weeks until sufficient expansion was obtained. Two of six flaps were followed for an additional 6 weeks after the 3-week expansion period to observe whether additional mucosa could be obtained. After measurement of the mucosal area, each flap was transferred as free flap to reconstruct an iatrogenic cheek defect. The increase of mucosal surface area was compared with the original graft, and differences were analyzed using the paired t test. All flaps were successfully expanded without any complications. Histologic evaluation revealed that grafted mucosa took well without evidence of graft necrosis, and the intergraft area was covered with histiocytes. Angiography revealed well-defined vascular structures covering the entire area of the flap. The new mucosal area (23.5 +/- 2.4 cm2) was significantly larger than the original mucosal graft (8.7 +/- 0.9 cm2) (p < 0.001). The net increase of the mucosal area was 172.9 +/- 32.4 percent. The increase of mucosal area in two flaps, following a 6-week consolidation period after 3 weeks of expansion, was only slightly greater (25.9 +/- 1.3 cm2) than those without the consolidation period (22.3 +/- 1.8 cm2). This increase of the mucosal area appears to be related to the amount of expansion, and not to the length of the consolidation period. The flaps were successfully transferred as free flaps to reconstruct the full-thickness cheek defects without major complications. Although a staged operation to allow flaps to mature is needed, the present procedure has the advantages of providing a mucosa-lined flap and allowing primary closure of the donor site. The authors conclude that expansion of this flap has great potential in reconstructive surgery.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-05-08", "authors": ["TakeshiMiyawaki", "DanielDegner", "Ian TJackson", "KhaledBarakat", "HeshamElmazar", "AndreaMoreira", "BorisSilberberg", "LeeAndrus", "MillesaGilsdorf"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200205000-00030"}
{"title": "The free latissimus dorsi flap revisited: a primary option for coverage of wide recurrent lumbosacral defects.", "abstract": "In comparison with other regions of the trunk, defects located in the lumbosacral region are infrequent. However, these particular lesions sometimes present difficulties in reconstruction, arising from the quality of the surrounding tissue and the width of the defects. In this area, the skin adheres strongly to subcutaneous tissue and is difficult to mobilize. Attempts to perform local or regional flaps for covering defects of this area often end in necrosis of the flaps, with subsequent risk of infection and unstable wounds. The consequence is larger defects and the need for a wide, tension-free coverage, which can be performed after a wide debridement. The authors report on 10 patients presenting with wide, recurrent (and in some cases, infected) defects of the lumbosacral region, after already having undergone several reconstructive local or regional operations. In all cases, the authors harvested a free latissimus dorsi flap, lengthening the pedicle by means of an arteriovenous suralis loop connected to the thoracodorsal vessels (lumbar defect) or the femoral vessels (sacral defect). The procedure, already described in the past by others, has been revisited by the authors' group and used as the technique of choice in selected cases, that is, in the presence of wide, recurrent, and infected lesions; radiation; and scarring injuries. The authors thus obtained stable coverage with well-vascularized tissue and were able to save the patients any further operations. The authors suggest, therefore, that this procedure can be used in cases of wide and recurrent defects where other conventional procedures have failed. Advantages, disadvantages, and technical features of the method used are discussed in this article.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-05-08", "authors": ["GiovanniDi Benedetto", "AldoBertani", "NorbertPallua"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200205000-00028"}
{"title": "Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible after oromandibular cancer surgery.", "abstract": "Although postoperative radiotherapy has proved effective in improving local control and survival in patients with head and neck cancers, its complications, especially mandibular osteoradionecrosis, reduce the quality of life. Mandibular surgery before the radiotherapy adds an additional risk factor for osteoradionecrosis. This study reviews patients in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, over a 10-year period, who underwent intraoral cancer resection followed by postoperative radiotherapy and thereafter developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. A total of 24 men and three women with a mean age of 49.9 years were identified and included in the study. In 10 cases, tumor resection was performed with a marginal mandibulectomy; in eight cases, tumor resection was performed after mandibular osteotomy; and in three cases, a segmental mandibulectomy was performed, and the defect was reconstructed with a fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap. In six cases, tumor excisions were performed without interfering with the mandibular continuity. Patients received postoperative external beam radiotherapy into the primary site and the neck, with a mean dose (+/-SD) of 5900 +/- 1300 cGy in an average of 35 fractions during an average of 6.5 weeks. The average elapsed time between the end of radiation therapy and clinical diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible was 11.2 months (range, 2 to 36 months). The time elapse between the end of the radiation therapy and the diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis was influenced by initial treatment (Kruskal-Wallis test: n = 27, chi-square = 12.884, p < 0.005), and this period was shorter if the mandibular osteotomy or marginal mandibulectomy was performed (the two lowest mean ranks in the test). However, if the initial surgery resulted in a segmental mandibulectomy reconstructed with a fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap, onset of the osteoradionecrosis was relatively late (Kruskal-Wallis test: n = 21, chi-square = 7.731, p = 0.052). After resection of osteoradionecrotic bone and surrounding soft tissue, 22 patients underwent reconstructive procedures with a fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap, and five patients underwent reconstructive procedures with an inferior genicular artery osteoperiosteal cutaneous flap. One fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap showed total failure and another showed a 25 percent skin loss; both were revised with pedicled flaps. The skin paddle of an inferior genicular artery flap was replaced with an anterolateral thigh flap because of anatomic variation of the skin vessel. Once the diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis is established, replacement of the dead bone and surrounding tissue with a vascularized free bone flap is inevitable, and a composite osteocutaneous free flap is a good option.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-05-08", "authors": ["NaciCelik", "Fu-chanWei", "Hung-chiChen", "Ming-hueiCheng", "Wei-chaoHuang", "Feng-chauTsai", "Yi-chiehChen"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200205000-00014"}
{"title": "A 10-year experience in nasal reconstruction with the three-stage forehead flap.", "abstract": "Because of its ideal color and texture, forehead skin is acknowledged as the best donor site with which to resurface the nose. However, all forehead flaps, regardless of their vascular pedicles, are thicker than normal nasal skin. Stiff and flat, they do not easily mold from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional shape. Traditionally, the forehead is transferred in two stages. At the first stage, frontalis muscle and subcutaneous tissue are excised distally and the partially thinned flap is inset into the recipient site. At a second stage, 3 weeks later, the pedicle is divided. However, such soft-tissue \"thinning\" is limited, incomplete, and piecemeal. Flap necrosis and contour irregularities are especially common in smokers and in major nasal reconstructions. To overcome these problems, the technique of forehead flap transfer was modified. An extra operation was added between transfer and division.At the first stage, a full-thickness forehead flap is elevated with all its layers and is transposed without thinning except for the columellar inset. Primary cartilage grafts are placed if vascularized intranasal lining is present or restored. Importantly, at the first stage, skin grafts or a folded forehead flap can be used effectively for lining. A full-thickness skin graft will reliably survive when placed on a highly vascular bed. A full-thickness forehead flap can be folded to replace missing cover skin, with a distal extension, in continuity, to supply lining. At the second stage, 3 weeks later during an intermediate operation, the full-thickness forehead flap, now healed to its recipient bed, is physiologically delayed. Forehead skin with 3 to 4 mm of subcutaneous fat (nasal skin thickness) is elevated in the unscarred subcutaneous plane over the entire nasal inset, except for the columella. Skin grafts or folded flaps integrate into adjacent normal lining and can be completely separated from the overlying cover from which they were initially vascularized. If used, a folded forehead flap is incised free along the rim, completely separating the proximal cover flap from the distal lining extension. The underlying subcutaneous tissue, frontalis muscle, and any previously positioned cartilage grafts are now widely exposed, and excess soft tissue can be excised to carve an ideal subunit, rigid subsurface architecture. Previous primary cartilage grafts can be repositioned, sculpted, or augmented, if required. Delayed primary cartilage grafts can be placed to support lining created from a skin graft or a folded flap. The forehead cover skin (thin, supple, and conforming) is then replaced on the underlying rigid, recontoured, three-dimensional recipient bed. The pedicle is not transected. At a third stage, 3 weeks later (6 weeks after the initial transfer), the pedicle is divided. Over 10 years in 90 nasal reconstructions for partial and full-thickness defects, the three-stage forehead flap technique with an intermediate operation was used with primary and delayed primary grafts, and with intranasal lining flaps (n = 15), skin grafts (n = 11), folded forehead flaps (n = 3), turnover flaps (n = 5), prefabricated flaps (n = 4), and free flaps for lining (n = 2). Necrosis of the forehead flap did not occur. Late revisions were not required or were minor in partial defects. In full-thickness defects, a major revision and more than two minor revisions were performed in less than 5 percent of patients. Overall, the aesthetic results approached normal. The planned three-stage forehead flap technique of nasal repair with an intermediate operation (1) transfers subtle, conforming forehead skin of ideal thinness for cover, with little risk of necrosis; (2) uses primary and delayed primary grafts and permits modification of initial cartilage grafts to correct failures of design, malposition, or scar contraction before flap division; (3) creates an ideal, rigid subsurface framework of hard and soft tissue that is reflected through overlying skin and blends well into adjacent recipient tissues; (4) expands the application of lining techniques to include the use of skin grafts for lining at the first stage, or as a \"salvage procedure\" during the second stage, and also permits the aesthetic use of folded forehead flaps for lining; (5) ensures maximal blood supply and vascular safety to all nasal layers; (6) provides the surgeon with options to salvage reconstructive catastrophes; (7) improves the aesthetic result while decreasing the number and difficulty of revision operations and overall time for repair; and (8) emphasizes the interdependence of anatomy (cover, lining, and support) and provides insight into the nature of wound injury and repair in nasal reconstruction.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-05-08", "authors": ["Frederick JMenick"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200205000-00010"}

All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, color fundus photography, and fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography at regular intervals. Inclusion criteria were as follows: eyes had serous and/or hemorrhagic pigment epithelium detachment (PED) and retinal detachment in the posterior pole, and ICG angiography revealed a branching vascular network with polypoidal dilations at the terminals of the network. Exclusion criteria were as follows: other diseases such as exudative age-related macular degeneration, high myopia, angioid streaks, and presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and patients who previously underwent any ocular surgery.\nPatients were followed for mean of 39.9 months (range, 24-54 months). PCV was present in 10 (83%) men and two women and in the elderly (mean age 68.1 years), usually unilateral (83%) with vascular lesions located at the macula (93%). The PCV manifested in two patterns, exudative and hemorrhagic. In the exudative pattern, serous PED and retinal detachment were predominant at the macula. The hemorrhagic pattern was characterized by hemorrhagic PED and subretinal hemorrhage at the macula. ICG angiography revealed polypoidal choroidal neovascularization that was changeable in appearance and repeatedly grew and spontaneously regressed, but the vascular network persisted. In some eyes, a collection of small aneurysmal dilations of vessels resembling a cluster of grapes appeared and all of them had marked bleeding and leakage and worse outcome.\nPolypoidal choroidal vasculopathy is a long persistent chronic disease and the patients had a variable course. Fifty percent of the patients had a favorable course. In the remaining half of the patients, the disorder persisted for a long time with occasional repeated bleeding and leakage, resulting in macular degeneration and visual loss.

{"title": "Melphalan availability in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha+/+ and factor-1alpha-/- tumors is independent of tumor vessel density and correlates with melphalan erythrocyte transport.", "abstract": "Many tumors are impervious to anticancer agents. Resistance due to lack of cytotoxic penetration into the tumor is often overlooked but can play a significant role in undermining therapy. Insufficient and irregular vascularization of tumors is a possible barrier to drug delivery, but there are others, e.g., impaired vessel permeability and poor interstitial transport. We evaluated the importance of tumor vessel density in the availability of melphalan to tumors. A nude mouse tumor model with different vascularization due to a single-gene deletion of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha(+/+) and HIF-1alpha(-/-) embryonic stem cell-derived tumors) was used. The availability of melphalan to HIF-1alpha(+/+) (n = 20) and HIF-1alpha(-/-) (n = 23) tumors was not significantly different (p = 0.12). Furthermore, in the various subgroup analyses accentuating the difference in vessel density, no significant correlation between vessel density and melphalan availability was found. In the second part of the study, melphalan, was demonstrated to be transported in blood in mice with a distribution of 24% in erythrocytes vs. 76% in plasma. A strong correlation (r = 0.93, p < 0.000001) between melphalan concentrations in plasma and erythrocytes was found, indicating an equilibrium between these 2 compartments. Plasma and erythrocyte concentrations of melphalan are correlated with the tumor availability of melphalan (r = 0.66 and 0.64, respectively, both p < 0.001). These data suggest that tumor vessel density is not an important predictor of the tumor availability of small cytotoxic drugs such as melphalan and indicate the importance of erythrocytes in the transport of melphalan.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2002-05-07", "authors": ["HansWildiers", "GunterGuetens", "Gertde Boeck", "WillyLanduyt", "EricVerbeken", "MartinHighley", "Ernst Ade Bruijn", "Allan Tvan Oosterom"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.10391"}
{"title": "Effects of oxygen on engineered cardiac muscle.", "abstract": "Concentration gradients associated with the in vitro cultivation of engineered tissues that are vascularized in vivo result in the formation of only a thin peripheral tissue-like region (e.g., approximately 100 microm for engineered cardiac muscle) around a relatively cell-free interior. We previously demonstrated that diffusional gradients within engineered cardiac constructs can be minimized by direct perfusion of culture medium through the construct. In the present study, we measured the effects of medium perfusion rate and local oxygen concentration (p(O2)) on the in vitro reconstruction of engineered cardiac muscle. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were seeded onto biodegradable polymer scaffolds (fibrous discs, 1.1 cm diameter x 2 mm thick, made of polyglycolic acid, 24 x 10(6) cells per scaffold). The resulting cell-polymer constructs were cultured for a total of 12 days in serially connected cartridges (n = 1-8), each containing one construct directly perfused with culture medium at a flow rate of 0.2-3.0 mL/min. In all groups, oxygen concentration decreased due to cell respiration, and depended on construct position in the series and medium flow rate. Higher perfusion rates and higher p(O2) correlated with more aerobic cell metabolism, and higher DNA and protein contents. Constructs cultured at p(O2) of 160 mm Hg had 50% higher DNA and protein contents, markedly higher expression of sarcomeric alpha-actin, better organized sarcomeres and cell junctions, and 4.5-fold higher rate of cell respiration as compared to constructs cultured at p(O2) of 60 mm Hg. Contraction rates of the corresponding cardiac cell monolayers were 40% higher at p(O2) of 160 than 60 mm Hg. The control of oxygen concentration in cell microenvironment can thus improve the structure and function of engineered cardiac muscle.

{"title": "Anterior versus posterior approach in reconstruction of infected nonunion of the tibia using the vascularized fibular graft: potentialities and limitations.", "abstract": "The potentialities, limitations, and technical pitfalls of the vascularized fibular grafting in infected nonunions of the tibia are outlined on the basis of 14 patients approached anteriorly or posteriorly. An infected nonunion of the tibia together with a large exposed area over the shin of the tibia is better approached anteriorly. The anastomosis is placed in an end-to-end or end-to-side fashion onto the anterior tibial vessels. To locate the site of the nonunion, the tibialis anterior muscle should be retracted laterally and the proximal and distal ends of the site of the nonunion debrided up to healthy bleeding bone. All the scarred skin over the anterior tibia should be excised, because it becomes devitalized as a result of the exposure. To cover the exposed area, the fibula has to be harvested with a large skin paddle, incorporating the first septocutaneous branch originating from the peroneal vessels before they gain the upper end of the flexor hallucis longus muscle. A disadvantage of harvesting the free fibula together with a skin paddle is that its pedicle is short. The skin paddle lies at the antimesenteric border of the graft, the site of incising and stripping the periosteum. In addition, it has to be sutured to the skin at the recipient site, so the soft tissues (together with the peroneal vessels), cannot be stripped off the graft to prolong its pedicle. Vein grafts should be resorted to, if the pedicle does not reach a healthy segment of the anterior tibial vessels. Defects with limited exposed areas of skin, especially in questionable patency of the vessels of the leg, require primarily a fibula with a long pedicle that could easily reach the popliteal vessels and are thus better approached posteriorly. In this approach, the site of the nonunion is exposed medial to the flexor digitorum muscle and the proximal and distal ends of the site of the nonunion debrided up to healthy bleeding bone. No attempt should be made to strip the scarred skin off the anterior aspect of the bone lest it should become devitalized. Any exposed bone on the anterior aspect should be left to granulate alone. This occurs readily when stability has been regained at the fracture site after transfer of the free fibula. The popliteal and posterior tibial vessels are exposed, and the microvascular anastomosis placed in an end-to-side fashion onto either of them, depending on the length of the pedicle and the condition of the vessels themselves. To obtain the maximal length of the pedicle of the graft, the proximal osteotomy is placed at the neck of the fibula after decompressing the peroneal nerve. The distal osteotomy is placed as distally as possible. After detaching the fibula from the donor site, the proximal part of the graft is stripped subperiosteally, osteotomized, and discarded. Thus, a relatively long pedicle could be obtained. To facilitate subperiosteal stripping, the free fibula is harvested without a skin paddle. In this way, the use of a vein graft could be avoided. Patients presenting with infected nonunions of the tibia with extensive scarring of the lower extremity, excessively large areas of skin loss, and with questionable patency of the anterior and posterior tibial vessels are not suitable candidates for the free vascularized fibular graft. Although a vein graft could be used between the recipient popliteal and the donor peroneal vessels, its use decreases flow to the graft considerably. These patients are better candidates for the Ilizarov bone transport method with or without free latissimus dorsi transfer.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2002-05-07", "authors": ["Sherif MAmr", "Aly OEl-Mofty", "Sherif NAmin"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.21732"}

This study was performed to investigate the clinical application of this new technique in neurosurgical procedures, such as brain tumor resection and epilepsy surgery.\nThirty-four patients with gliomas (Grades II-IV), cerebral metastases, temporal lobe epilepsy, or cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and one patient with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were treated surgically with the aid of the waterjet. Resection was performed using waterjet dissection in combination with conventional neurosurgical procedures. Intraoperatively, the waterjet was easy to handle, and no complications due to the device were observed. Dissection of tissue was possible for all pathological conditions, and pressures between 3 and 45 bars were used. In gliomas, metastases, epilepsy surgery, and hemangioblastoma, the tissue was dissected at pressures between 3 and 17 bars, which preserved blood vessels. Dissection of meningiomas and the ICA stenosis required higher pressures (between 20 and 45 bars); with these pressures, blood vessels were also dissected.\nThese results indicate that the waterjet dissection procedure can be used intraoperatively without complications. This device appears to be particularly suitable for the dissection of highly vascularized gliomas or normal brain tissue, in which tissue dissection with sparing of blood vessels can be achieved.

The induction of 53 genes was confirmed by using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR: among these genes was MetAP2/p67, which encodes an activator of translational initiation and represents a validated target for inhibition of neovascularization. Furthermore, c-MYC induced the cell cycle regulatory genes CDC2-L1, Cyclin E binding protein 1, and Cyclin B1. The DNA repair genes BRCA1, MSH2, and APEX were induced by c-MYC, suggesting that c-MYC couples DNA replication to processes preserving the integrity of the genome. MNT, a MAX-binding antagonist of c-MYC function, was up-regulated, implying a negative feedback loop. In vivo promoter occupancy by c-MYC was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation for CDK4, Prohibitin, MNT, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin E binding protein 1, showing that these genes are direct c-MYC targets.

{"title": "Vasculogenesis and the search for the hemangioblast.", "abstract": "Embryonic endothelial cells (EC) are generated by two mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (1). The term vasculogenesis describes the de novo emergence of EC progenitors from the mesoderm, whereas angiogenesis corresponds to the generation of EC by sprouting from the pre-existing vascular network. Until recently, it was thought that vasculogenesis was restricted to the period of embryonic development, whereas in the adult, only angiogenesis contributed to EC proliferation. The discovery of circulating EC progenitors in adult bone marrow and peripheral blood has suggested that additional mechanisms besides angiogenesis can occur in the adult, and therefore have renewed interest in the embryonic origin and the development of these progenitor cells. Vasculogenesis in the chick embryo has been studied since the beginning of the 20th century. During early development, vasculogenesis is intimately linked to the emergence of hematopoietic cells (HC). The existence of a common precursor for both EC and HC, termed \"hemangioblast,\" was postulated (2). The purpose of this review is to summarize the experimental evidence concerning the emergence of EC and HC during embryonic life.", "journal": "Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research", "date": "2002-05-02", "authors": ["AnneEichmann", "LucPardanaud", "LiYuan", "DelphineMoyon"], "doi": "10.1089/152581602753658411"}

To characterize the biologic role of the vascular system in the mediation of ultraviolet-B-induced skin damage, we performed quantitative analyses of cutaneous blood vessels of mice after 10 wk of ultraviolet-B irradiation. Skin vascularization was greatly increased after chronic ultraviolet-B exposure with a significant increase of both the number and the size of dermal blood vessels, associated with upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the hyperplastic epidermis. To directly study whether inhibition of angiogenesis may diminish ultraviolet-B-induced cutaneous damage, wild-type and transgenic mice with skin-specific overexpression of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 were subjected to the same ultraviolet-B irradiation regimen. Ultraviolet-B-irradiated thrombospondin-1 transgenic mice showed a significantly reduced skin vascularization, decreased endothelial cell proliferation, and increased endothelial cell apoptosis rates, compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, dermal photo-damage and wrinkle formation were greatly reduced in thrombospondin-1 transgenic mice.

A peripheral general surgeon's experience with aortic surgery is reviewed in the present report in order to identify the local adverse outcome rates, and to relate them to case data and governance recommendations.\nA retrospective audit of 100 cases of elective and emergency aortic aneurysm repair (performed by the senior author over a 10-year period) was undergone for the present review. Demographic and outcome data were recorded, and a data analysis was performed to identify factors related to mortality. Significance was tested using chi-squared analysis.\nPostoperative mortality rates were 1.7% for elective cases and 21% for acute cases. Mortality was related to rupture of the aneurysm, blood loss and American Society of Anesthetists score > 3.\nMorbidity and mortality rates from this audit compare favourably with those from larger vascular units.

Sections of these casts were used to determine the vascular territories of defined brain areas. Histological serial sections (10 microm) of the brains served for correlation of findings. Analysis of the microvascular casts of both species revealed that the blood supply to and from these brains arose ventrally and dorsally, respectively. Neither species possesses an arterial circle (Circulus Willisi) and both have similar microvascular patterns. The only difference between Myxine and Eptatretus was that the posterior cerebral artery in Myxine divides into mesencephalic and rhombencephalic branches, and in Eptatretus a third branch, termed telencephalic branch, arises from the posterior cerebral artery. 3D-morphometry revealed that luminal diameters of: 1) intracerebral arteries and arterioles range from 35.11 +/- 5.66 microm (mean +/- SEM) in the hypothalamus to 92.69 +/- 14.48 microm in the thalamus; 2) capillaries range from 17.8 +/- 0.44 microm in the olfactory bulb to 21.70 +/- 0.87 microm in the basal ganglia; and 3) intracerebral venules and veins range from 49.38 +/- 4.17 microm in the hypothalamus to 75.58 +/- 6.59 microm in the rhombencephalon.

We previously showed that the development of biliary cirrhosis in the rat is associated with the occurrence of hepatocellular hypoxia and the induction of hepatic angiogenesis. We herein examined the occurrence of hypoxia in an experimental model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced cirrhosis. We also determined whether hypoxia directly affects the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), of VEGF receptors (Flt-1, Flk-1), and of type I and type IV collagens in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the expression of VEGF in hepatocytes. Our results show that in DEN-treated rats, although the progression of liver fibrosis is associated with hepatocellular hypoxia and angiogenesis, VEGF and Flt-1 expressions in the liver are increased and correlated with the density of microvessels. In vitro, hypoxia induces the expression of VEGF, Flt-1, and type I collagen in activated HSCs and that of VEGF in hepatocytes. In addition, we show that hypoxia-induced type I collagen expression in HSCs may occur independently of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) overexpression.

Many reconstructive techniques, ranging from spontaneous epithelialization to free flaps, have been described for orbital exenteration defects. The temporalis muscle flap is one of the most frequently used flaps to obliterate the orbital cavity, but only a small portion of the muscle can be used for this purpose because most of the muscle is used as the pedicle. The reverse temporalis muscle flap based on the superficial temporal vessels is a versatile flap by which the entire temporalis muscle can be elevated and carried to defects beyond the midline.

These traumatic injuries were unique in that, although devastating to the hand, they left the opportunity for salvage of distal vascularized and sensate components of the hand. Other unique challenges arose as a result of patients who did not want to pursue alternative reconstructive options such as toe-to-hand transfers or pollicization. These cases are presented to emphasize alternative algorithms to standard hand reconstruction in complex scenarios.

We now demonstrate that systemic administration of recombinant human IL-10 to animals bearing established highly malignant mammary tumors also leads to significant growth inhibition. We had shown previously that expression of the CXC chemokines Mig (monokine induced by IFN-gamma) and IP-10 (inducible protein 10) is observed in IL-10 transduced but not neo-vector control tumors. We now demonstrate that treatment of IL-10-tumor-bearing mice with antibodies to either chemokine partially reverses the therapeutic effect of IL-10. Tumor growth in animals treated with both antibodies is comparable with that of vector control tumors. Direct transduction of Mig cDNA into the parental tumor cell line before transplantation also results in smaller tumors. This tumor growth inhibition is associated with increased numbers of CD4+ cells, consistent with a T-cell chemoattractant activity for Mig. No change in vascularization, as indicated by CD31+ cells, was observed in either Mig or IL-10-transfected tumors. Thus, an antiangiogenic activity for either cytokine could not be confirmed.

Graft rejection and allospecific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) were used as measures of alloreactivity. Numbers of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)- and interleukin 2 (IL-2)-expressing cells were compared among hosts that retained their native CLN (CLN+) and CLN-hosts. Additionally, splenectomized mice (Sp-), and hosts without either CLN or spleen (CLN-Sp-) were evaluated.\nWithin 5 weeks, 100% of HR grafts among CLN+ hosts were rejected, and hosts of these grafts uniformly demonstrated allospecific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). In contrast, 92% of CLN-hosts accepted their HR allografts, and demonstrated suppressed allospecific DTH response. Moreover, significantly lower numbers of IFN-gamma- and IL-2-expressing cells were infiltrating corneal grafts in CLN-group. All Sp-hosts rejected corneal allografts in an accelerated manner, whereas 86% of CLN-Sp-hosts accepted their allografts indefinitely.\nDraining CLN play a critical role in alloimmunity and rejection of HR corneal grafts, suggesting the essential function of CLN in corneal alloimmunization regardless of the degree of preoperative risk.

In postnatal life, SDF-1 is widely expressed and is induced in chronically inflamed tissues such as psoriatic skin and the rheumatoid synovium, but has also been implicated in the migration of lymphocytes to lymphoid organs. To investigate the role of SDF-1 in recirculation and homing in vivo, we have developed a model in which human peripheral lymph nodes (huPLN) are transplanted into SCID mice. We have shown that huPLN transplants are viable, vascularized by the murine circulation that forms functional anastomoses with transplant vessels. In addition, grafts retain some features of the pretransplantation tissue, such as lymphoid follicles, lymphatic and high endothelial venule markers. We also show that SDF-1 is capable of inducing the migration of a SDF-1-responsive cell line (U937) and human PBLs from the murine circulation into the grafts in a dose-dependent manner, inhibitable by CXCR4 blockade. The mechanism of action of SDF-1 in this model is independent from that of TNF-alpha and does not rely on the up-regulation of adhesion molecules (such as ICAM-1) on the graft vascular endothelium. This is the first description of huPLN transplantation into SCID mice and of the functional effects of SDF-1 in regard to the migration of human cells into huPLN in vivo.

Techniques that allow quantitation of vascular microarchitecture are needed. A comprehensive method is presented that uses 6-microm-thick serial sections of frozen tissue samples, immunostaining for CD31, brightfield microscopy, automated alignment of two-dimensional serial sections, and volume rendering to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional, quantifiable images of microvascular structure. Application of the technique is shown by characterizing vascularization into a fibrin gel implanted against the skeletal muscle of rats and explanted after 7 days. Comparing measurements from automated and manually aligned MRI and fibrin samples verified quantitation. Automation removes concerns of observer bias or variation inherent in manual alignment and increases the speed of analysis. Analysis of the fibrin gel reveals a dense (4.3 +/- 1.1% endothelial cell density) network of tortuous (1.37 +/- 0.05 tortuosity) capillaries that replaces the gel as it degrades. There is a high level of void space (22.8 +/- 3.6%) in the gel, and average capillary length in the fibrovascular tissue was 93.0 +/- 7.4 microm.

The light and electron microscopy methods were used, as well as histochemical visualization of NADPH-diaphorase in the vessel cells. The endothelium proliferation was evaluated using antibodies to proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Starting from week 8 of development, the tangentially oriented vessels formed a intraneural network in the ventricular zone of the rudiment, which appears to restrict the motility of neuroepithelial cells. The basal membrane was initially absent, and the neuroepithelial cells were in direct contact with the endothelial cells. During week 9 of development, the tangentially oriented vessels appeared in the intermediate zone. Formations similar to glial legs with short regions of the basal membrane adjoined the walls of inter- and intraneural vessels (note that, according to the published data, glial fibrillary acidic protein is not yet visualized at this stage). Angioarchitectonics depended little on the cell population density in different zones of the rudiment; specifically, the cortical plate did not contain tangentially oriented vessels until week 12-13 of development.

{"title": "The relative roles of aggressive wound care versus revascularization in salvage of the threatened lower extremity in the renal failure diabetic patient.", "abstract": "Current literature indicates poor survival and limb salvage rates in renal failure diabetic patients who present with ulcerated or gangrenous lower extremities. Even in those limbs that were successfully revascularized, the amputation rate was as high as 37 percent. This has led some to advocate immediate amputation when treating the threatened limb of a renal failure diabetic patient. The authors reviewed all renal failure diabetic patients in their wound registry to determine whether such pessimism was warranted. The authors then analyzed the relative roles of revascularization and aggressive wound care on long-term limb salvage. Forty-five consecutive renal failure diabetic patients with 71 wounds in 54 limbs were identified. Twenty-seven patients had chronic renal insufficiency, 15 patients had end-stage renal disease, and three patients received kidney transplants. The revascularization procedures (46 percent of all limbs) included angioplasty, femoral-popliteal, femoral-distal, and popliteal-distal bypasses. Forty-three amputations in combination with 67 soft-tissue repairs (delayed primary wound closure, skin grafts, local flaps, pedicled flaps, and free flaps) were necessary to close the defects. After a mean follow-up of over 3 years, the data indicate that 79 percent of wounds healed, 89 percent of all limbs were salvaged, and 49 percent of patients survived. Revascularization improved the threatened limb's salvage rate from negligible to a level similar to that of the adequately vascularized limb. Fifteen out of 71 wounds did not heal because of the patient's early postoperative death, ischemia not amenable to revascularization, or noncompliance. Six below-knee amputations were performed (one despite a patent bypass and five in adequately vascularized patients). The average time for wounds to heal in the revascularized patients was 79 days versus 71 days in adequately vascularized patients. There was an overall 43 percent complication rate. Of the patients who were alive after the 3-year follow-up, 73 percent were independently ambulating, whereas 27 percent were bound to wheelchair or bed. Eighty-two percent of patients were very satisfied with the salvage attempt, 18 percent were moderately satisfied, and all patients said they would go through the process again. The authors believe that salvaging the threatened extremity in the renal failure diabetic patient is justified whether or not the limb requires revascularization. Revascularization improved the limb salvage rate, patient survival, and days for wounds to heal to a level comparable to that of the adequately vascularized limb. The key to subsequently achieving high salvage rates is the quality of perioperative wound care (e.g., serial debridements, antibiotics, dressings) and the timing and selection of appropriate soft-tissue coverage.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-04-20", "authors": ["Christopher EAttinger", "IvicaDucic", "Richard FNeville", "Mark RAbbruzzese", "MarioGomes", "Anton NSidawy"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200204010-00011"}

Use of a composite flap transfer merely to fill the defect results in unsatisfactory functional and aesthetic outcomes. The authors present a reconstructive procedure for complex maxillary defects using the latissimus dorsi-scapular rib osteomusculocutaneous flap. Some modifications for the reconstruction of the nasal cavity and the hard palate contributed to excellent postoperative functions. Five cases of extended maxillary defect were reconstructed using a novel procedure between February of 1997 and October of 2000. The hard palate was reconstructed with a vascularized scapular angle. The infraorbital rim was reconstructed with a vascularized rib if it was required. A prop bone graft, replacing the zygomatic buttress, was added between the infraorbital rim and the hard palate. The latissimus dorsi muscle flap, which was supported by a skeletal framework and obliterated the remaining cavities around the bone grafts, was left exposed into the nasal cavity, and an 8-French (no. 10) nasal airway tube was placed as a stent in the nasal meatus for 3 weeks after surgery. A skin graft was applied on the scapular angle to reconstruct the oral side of the hard palate. If required, facial skin defect was repaired with a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap or scapular flap. No major complications at the recipient or the donor sites occurred postoperatively in any of the five cases. In cases in which the eyeballs were preserved, almost normal facial appearance was obtained and an orbital extirpation case showed an acceptable postoperative appearance. All five patients returned to an unrestricted diet and their speech was assessed as normal by a speech test. Nasal breathing through the re-epithelialized meatus was possible in all cases. The reconstructed nasal cavity was maintained for more than 6 months in all cases and for more than 2 years in one early case. Rhinometry demonstrated normal function, and histologic findings of the re-epithelialized mucosa over the muscle flap in the nasal cavity revealed a nearly normal architecture. This technique simplifies the reconstructive procedure of massive maxillary defects, including those in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.

{"title": "Neurovascular free-muscle transfer to treat facial paralysis associated with hemifacial microsomia.", "abstract": "Despite the wide spectrum of hemifacial microsomia manifestations, treatment mainly focuses on mandible and ear abnormalities, rather than on facial paralysis. In fact, the surgical treatment of facial paralysis associated with hemifacial microsomia is quite underdeveloped, because the degree of paralysis is frequently incomplete or partial. Timing and type of surgery are also difficult to determine. Neurovascular free-muscle transfer is now a standard procedure for the dynamic smile reconstruction of longstanding facial paralysis. This type of strategy has considerable potential in the treatment of facial paralysis in patients with hemifacial microsomia. We present here our experience with neurovascular free-muscle transfer for smile reconstruction in eight patients with facial paralysis associated with hemifacial microsomia. The age of the patients at the time of surgery ranged from 7 to 28 years old, (average, 13.9 years). Six were male patients and two were female patients. The two-stage method combining gracilis muscle transfer with cross-face nerve grafting was performed in three patients, whereas the one-stage transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle was performed in five. To construct a natural or near-natural smile, the muscles were transferred into the paralyzed cheek in all except one patient, in whom the latissimus dorsi muscle was transferred into the sublabial area to reconstruct a paralyzed lower lip. A dermal flap segment vascularized with perforating vessels from the latissimus dorsi muscle was simultaneously inserted into the underdeveloped cheek for soft-tissue augmentation in this patient. Muscle contraction was evident in all patients between 4 and 8 months after muscle transfer. Our present series revealed that neurovascular free-muscle transfer is a good option not only for smile reconstruction but also for restoration of the facial contours of patients with hemifacial microsomia. Compared with the two-stage method combining gracilis muscle transfer with cross-face nerve grafting, the one-stage method using the latissimus dorsi muscle has some advantages, including a one-stage operation, a shorter recovery period, and the absence of sequelae that occur after harvesting a sural nerve.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-04-20", "authors": ["AkihikoTakushima", "KiyonoriHarii", "HirotakaAsato", "AtsushiYamada"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200204010-00001"}

The arterial blood supply of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon was highly consistent. The radial recurrent artery vascularized the entire proximal tendon through direct branches to the medial and lateral border of the tendon forming a network of small vessels on the surface of the tendon. Important contributions were provided by the posterior branch of the radial collateral artery, and minor contributions were provided by the interosseous recurrent artery. The undersurface of the tendon seemed almost avascular. This observation suggests that potential hypovascular zones might be located at the undersurface of the tendon causing degeneration and partial tear of the tendon, and that this might be an etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of lateral epicondylitis.

In the case of Stat3, it is believed that this activation leads to the induction of survival signals as well as increased proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that Stat3 is constitutively activated in glioma and medulloblastoma tumors and that the activated protein localizes predominantly to the tumor endothelial cells in the highly vascularized glioma tumors. Our efforts to elucidate potential mechanism(s) for this activated protein have shown that coexpression of Stat3alpha and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) result in ligand-independent activation of Stat3alpha tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent transcriptional activation in non-endothelial cells. We also show that activated Stat3alpha can increase transcription from the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene.

It participates in a variety of biological processes such as the induction of mitogenesis and of morphological changes, the production of cytokines and growth factors, and apoptosis. To clarify the role of thrombin in the proliferation of human malignant gliomas, we investigated its effect on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro and determined its intrinsic expression in human glioma tissues. In 3 human glioma cell lines tested, U-87 MG, U-251 MG, and U-105 MG, thrombin induced the VEGF mRNA expression and protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The thrombin receptor expression was detectable by RT-PCR and immunoblot. The secretion of VEGF protein in glioma cells was stimulated by the thrombin receptor agonist peptide and the induction of VEGF was significantly blocked by the thrombin inhibitor hirudin, indicating that the up-regulation of VEGF was mediated by the thrombin/thrombin receptor pathway. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that prothrombin, the precursor of thrombin, was distributed in all 10 glioma tissues examined. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis revealed the co-localization of prothrombin mRNA-positive and GFAP-positive cells in the glioma tissues.

The discussed underlying mechanism for this effect is an synergistic cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effect of hyperthermia. In addition, tumor blood-flow and, consequently, tumor oxygenation are increased during hyperthermia. Tumor response to irradiation and chemotherapy of well-oxygenated and vascularized tumors, in general, is superior to that of hypoxic tumors. Therefore, tumor oxygenation is recognized as an important predictive factor in the therapy of malignant tumors. Technically, the head-neck area remains outside the hyperthermia chamber during whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) as currently applied in a number of cancer treatment regimens. The aim of this therapeutic approach was to evaluate whether the blood flow during WBH also increased in the head-neck region and, if so, whether tumor oxygenation increase accordingly.\nA 60-year-old male Caucasian patient, with the original diagnosis of pT3 pN2b M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, who had undergone primary surgery and irradiation (total dose 60 Gy), developed three local recurrences with consecutive surgical resection, presenting now with another recurrent local tumor (histologically confirmed) without surgical or radiotherapeutical options due to lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. WBH was applied under full anaesthesia, using a humidified radiant heat device (Enthermics Medical Systems RHS-7500) in combination with synchronous application of chemotherapy (ifosfamide and carboplatin). Four cycles of this combined treatment (one cycle per month) were given. Tumor oxygenation and temperature were continuously monitored by Licox catheters by means of one point measurement during each treatment (3.5 h).\nWith a latency of 10 min, the increase of intratumoral temperature in the oral cavity was comparable to reference values in the esophagous. Maximum intratumoral temperature (oral cavity) was 41.8 degrees C (F). The average increase of tumor oxygenation was more than 100% in each individual cycle. Clinically, a partial tumor response was observed.\nDuring combined WBH and polychemotherapy, oxygenation is also significantly improved in a tumor in the head and neck area despite the fact that head and neck area remains outside the hyperthermia chamber during WBH.

The aims of the studies were 1) to get information about the physiological load transfer in the normal hip joint, 2) to get information about the load transfer between acetabulum and acetabular sockets and vice versa, 3) to measure the periacetabular pelvic bone deformation as the stimulator of the remodelling process (third stage of osseointegration) in the normal hip joint and in hip joints fitted with different acetabular cups, 4) to study the morphological stages of osseointegration of a non-cemented press-fit cup and to compare the morphological structure of the periacetabular bone with the biomechanical data obtained by the in vitro studies and finally, 5) to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of follow-up studies of the senior author's \"Press-Fit cup\" with the theoretical hypotheses according to the experimental observations.\nLoad transfer between the acetabular bone and the femoral head on one side and press-fit cups has been determined by strain gauge measurements, finite element studies, pressure sensitive Fuji prescale films, CT-osteoabsorptiometry and telemetric measurements. Periacetabular deformation has been measured by Imetric Markers. Osseointegration of the senior author's press-fit cup and, thus, the remodelling process of the bony structures adjacent to the cup have been studied in autopsy specimens of THRs which have been in situ for several years.\nLoad transfer measurements have shown that the main load in the original acetabulum as well as in the acetabulum fitted with a press-fit cup is transmitted to the periphery, especially to the acetabular cortical rim whereas the subchondral bone is exposed to lower, predominantly meridional (tension) stresses. Direct measurements of the periacetabular deformation under load revealed an increase of the peripheral press-fit with increasing stability of a (oversized) press-fit cup. Both the normal as well as the acetabulum fitted with a non-cemented cup deforms in a postero-medial direction. The histo-morphology of the periacetabular bone of autopsy specimens showed excellent bony in- and ongrowth of a porous titanium coating (SULMESH) and bone formation, especially at the periphery in zone 1 and 3 according to DeLee and Charnley.\nThe studies have shown that the subchondral bone plate of the acetabulum has very little supportive function for non-cemented press-fit cups. For the preparation of the acetabulum it is, therefore, more important to ream the sclerotic subchondral bone until there is a well vascularized, well bleeding bone bed to facilitate osseointegration of a non-cemented acetabular socket than to preserve the subchondral bone plate as is the case in cement fixation. A non-cemented press-fit socket must transmit load predominantly to the cortical bone of the acetabular rim. Therefore, a too far medial positioning of the cup, and therefore loosing contact to the cortical rim, must be avoided under all circumstances. The clinical experience with acetabular revisions and with conversions of hip arthrodeses into a THR (where there is no subchondral bone at all) have shown the superiority of a well vascularized over a sclerotic (even mechanically stronger) bone bed. Furthermore, it has been shown that the additional use of screws for fixation of an acetabular cup is not only unnecessary but can be deleterious and causes complications including osteolysis and aseptic loosening.", "journal": "Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca", "date": "2002-04-16", "authors": ["E WMorscher", "K HWidmer", "HBereiter", "RElke", "RSchenk"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Ultrastructure and blood supply of the tegmentum vasculosum in the cochlea of the duckling.", "abstract": "The tegmentum vasculosum of the duckling consists of a highly folded epithelium which extends over the dorsal and lateral walls of the cochlear duct, separating the scala media from the scala vestibuli. This epithelium consists of two distinct cell types, dark cells and light cells, and is well vascularized. The surface of the epithelium is formed by a mosaic of alternating dark and light cells. The goblet-shaped dark cells have an electron-dense, organelle-rich cytoplasm, and are expanded basally by extensive basolateral plasma membrane infoldings, within which are numerous mitochondria. Dark cells are isolated from each other and from the capillaries within the epithelium by intervening light cells. In contrast, columnar light cells exhibit an electron-lucent, organelle-poor cytoplasm and may extend from the underlying capillaries to the endolymphatic surface. Light cells contain abundant, coated endocytic vesicles on their apical surfaces and are bound, apically, to other light cells or to dark cells by tight junctions and desmosomes. Laterally, light cells are linked to each other either by complex, fluid-filled membrane interdigitations or by extensive gap junctions. Plasma membrane interdigitations and obvious, fluid-filled intercellular spaces characterize the lateral borders between light and dark cells. Vascular corrosion casting reveals the three-dimensional anatomy of the cochlear vasculature. A continuous arteriolar loop fed by anterior and posterior cochlear arterioles encircles the cochlear duct. The rich capillary beds of the tegmentum vasculosum are supplied by arching arterioles arising from this loop. These capillaries are the continuous type and are situated primarily within the core of the epithelium or along its border with the scala vestibuli. The structure and blood supply of the tegmentum vasculosum are characteristic of an epithelium involved in active transport.", "journal": "Hearing research", "date": "2002-04-13", "authors": ["Fred EHossler", "Kenneth ROlson", "GeorgeMusil", "Michael IMcKamey"], "doi": "10.1016/s0378-5955(01)00427-0"}
{"title": "Tissue ingrowth and degradation of two biodegradable porous polymers with different porosities and pore sizes.", "abstract": "Commonly, spontaneous repair of lesions in the avascular zone of the knee meniscus does not occur. By implanting a porous polymer scaffold in a knee meniscus defect, the lesion is connected with the abundantly vascularized knee capsule and healing can be realized. Ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue and thus healing capacity depended on porosity, pore sizes and compression modulus of the implant. To study the lesion healing potential, two series of porous polyurethanes based on 50/50 epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide with different porosities and pore sizes were implanted subcutaneously in rats. Also, in vitro degradation of the polymer was evaluated. The porous polymers with the higher porosity, more interconnected macropores, and interconnecting micropores of at least 30 microm showed complete ingrowth of tissue before degradation had started. In implants with the lower macro-porosity and micropores of 10-15 microm degradation of the polymer occurred before ingrowth was completed. Directly after implantation and later during degradation of the polymer, PMN cells infiltrated the implant. In between these phases the foreign body reaction remained restricted to macrophages and giant cells. We can conclude that both foams seemed not suited for implantation in meniscal reconstruction while either full ingrowth of tissue was not realized before polymer degradation started or the compression modulus was too low. Therefore, foams must be developed with a higher compression modulus and more connections with sufficient diameter between the macropores.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2002-04-13", "authors": ["Tony Gvan Tienen", "Ralf G J CHeijkants", "PieterBuma", "Jacqueline Hde Groot", "Albert JPennings", "Rene P HVeth"], "doi": "10.1016/s0142-9612(01)00280-0"}
{"title": "Variation in eggshell characteristics and in intrauterine egg retention between two oviparous clades of the lizard Lacerta vivipara: insight into the oviparity-viviparity continuum in squamates.", "abstract": "The concept of the oviparity-viviparity continuum refers to the wide range in the length of intrauterine egg retention and, hence, in the stage of embryonic development at oviposition existing in squamates. The evolutionary process underlying this continuum may involve not only a lengthening of egg retention in utero, but also a marked reduction in the thickness of the eggshell. The idea that there may exist a negative correlation between the developmental stage reached by the embryo at oviposition and the eggshell thickness within squamates, although supported by the comparison of oviparous vs. viviparous species, has seldom been evaluated by comparing eggshell thickness of oviparous forms with different lengths of intrauterine egg retention. Eggs of two distinct oviparous clades of the lizard Lacerta vivipara were compared. The eggs laid by females from Slovenian and Italian populations have thicker eggshells, contain embryos on average less developed at the time of oviposition, and require a longer incubation period before hatching than the eggs laid by females from French oviparous populations. Our data and several other examples available from the literature support the idea that the lengthening of intrauterine retention of eggs and the shortening of the subsequent external incubation of eggs are associated with reduction in the thickness of the eggshell, at least in some lineages of oviparous squamates. The current hypotheses that may account for this correlation are presented and a few restrictions and refinements to those hypotheses are discussed. In particular, other changes, such as increased vascularization of the oviduct and of the extraembryonic membranes, may play the same role as the decrease of eggshell thickness in facilitating prolonged intrauterine egg retention in squamates. Future studies should also consider the hypothesis that the length of intrauterine retention might directly depend on the extent of maternal-fetal chemical communication through the eggshell barrier.", "journal": "Journal of morphology", "date": "2002-04-12", "authors": ["BenoitHeulin", "SamueleGhielmi", "NusaVogrin", "YannSurget-Groba", "Claude PierreGuillaume"], "doi": "10.1002/jmor.1103"}

We have investigated whether sustained and localized delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) combined with transplantation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) can be used to engineer new vascular networks. VEGF was incorporated and released in a sustained manner from porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLG) matrices to promote angiogenesis at the transplantation site. VEGF could be incorporated and released in a biologically active form from PLG matrices, with the majority of VEGF release (64%) occurring within 2 weeks. These matrices promoted a 260% increase in the density of host SCID mouse-derived capillaries invading the matrices after 7 days of implantation, confirming the activity of the released VEGF. HMVECs were transplanted into SCID mice on PLG matrices, and organized to form immature human-derived vessels within 3 days. Functional vessels were observed within 7 days. Importantly, when HMVECs were transplanted on VEGF-releasing matrices, a 160% increase in the density of human-derived blood vessels was observed after 14 days.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and color duplex sonography (CDS) to classify PGs according to topography and vascularization. Sixteen patients harboring 22 PGs were studied retrospectively. With digital subtraction angiography as reference, the topographic relation of the tumors to the carotid arteries and the internal jugular vein and the patterns of vascularization were assessed. On MRI and CDS the typical feature of 15 carotid PGs was splaying of the carotid bifurcation, with the external carotid displaced anteriorly and the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein located posteriorly. In five vagal PGs both modalities showed unidirectional anterior displacement of the external and internal carotid arteries. Two jugular PGs were found to extend within the lumen of the internal jugular vein. CDS completely depicted carotid body tumors but failed to delineate the high cervical portion of vagal and jugular PGs. MRI allowed us to assess the entire extent of all PGs. Nineteen lesions showed flow voids corresponding to abundant flow signal on CDS: three carotid body tumors appeared hypovascular on CDS and MRI. On CDS, intratumoral flow was directed cranially in carotid and inferiorly in vagal and jugular PGs.

The available information is still inadequate for the equine retina despite the importance of eye diseases in equine medicine.

Thirty normal eyes of 15 healthy horses were examined immediately after slaughter. The retina of the horse differs considerably in the degree and quantity of neurons and glial elements as well as in vascular patterns compared to the retina of other domestic animals. Morphometric analysis revealed that the thickness of the retina varies between 80 microm at the ora serrata and 250 microm medial to the optic disc. Approximately 90% of the equine retina is comparatively thin (< 130 microm). This is a physiologic response to the distance that oxygen can diffuse in avascular retina. Ganglion cells form a single layer in all parts of the retina. The majority of ganglion cells are very large Nissl-positive cells. Small Nissl-negative ganglion cells are less abundant. A high ganglion cell density is found only in the central area. Vascularization is virtually absent from the retina with the exception of a narrow strip around the disc of the optic nerve, as revealed by lectin histochemistry.

Previous attempts to examine the roles of VEGF in vivo have been largely unsuccessful because deletion of even one VEGF allele leads to embryonic lethality before skeletal development is initiated. The availability of mice expressing only the VEGF120 isoform (which do survive to term) has offered an opportunity to explore the function of VEGF during embryonic skeletal development. Our study of these mice provides new in vivo evidence for multiple important roles of VEGF in both endochondral and intramembranous bone formation, as well as some insights into isoform-specific functions. There are two key differences in vascularization of developing bones between wild-type and VEGF(120/120) mice. VEGF(120/120) mice have not only a delayed recruitment of blood vessels into the perichondrium but also show delayed invasion of vessels into the primary ossification center, demonstrating a significant role of VEGF at both an early and late stage of cartilage vascularization. These findings are the basis for a two-step model of VEGF-controlled vascularization of the developing skeleton, a hypothesis that is supported by the new finding that VEGF is expressed robustly in the perichondrium and surrounding tissue of cartilage templates of future bones well before blood vessels appear in these regions.

{"title": "Relationships between trabecular bone remodeling and bone vascularization: a quantitative study.", "abstract": "Beside its well-known role in bone development, vascularization plays a major role in bone cell migration for bone remodeling and metastatic tumor invasion. However, the various techniques used to identify vessels in bone have never been tested for trabecular bone vessel quantification, whereas bone remodeling quantitative parameters are commonly assessed. In this context, we developed and compared various histological techniques used to visualize blood vessels in rat bone in order to quantify them. First, several products were tested by intracardiac infusion to opacify the bone vascular network. The best results were obtained using either an India ink-1% agarose solution or an India ink-saturated barium sulfate solution followed by X-ray microradiography. Second, to identify the types of vessels, we also performed histoenzymology and immunohistochemistry stainings. Neither alkaline phosphatase (for endothelial cells) nor adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) stainings (for smooth muscle cells) provided a low enough background to allow for vessel identification and quantification. For immunohistochemistry, various specific vessel constituents were analyzed: laminin, smooth muscle cell alpha-actin, factor VIII, and lectin Griffonia simplifolia. Anti-laminin and anti-smooth muscle cell alpha-actin antibodies gave the best results for quantification. Third, after optimization of these techniques, we performed quantitative bone and vessel histomorphometry on two groups of 12 rats each, for which bone remodeling and vessel number and area parameters were measured. No statistical differences were observed between the two groups, confirming the reproducibility of our measurements. A significant relationship was found between vessel number and histodynamic parameters; that is, bone formation rate correlated positively with India ink-positive vessel area (p < 0.009, r2 = 0.54) and alpha-actin-positive vessel number (p < 0.05, r2 = 0.66).

This investigation was designed as an observational cross-sectional study. A group of 25 patients in gestational age of five to eleven weeks were recruited for the study. Architecture of the embryonic vessels was depicted by 3D power flow mapping and analyzed visually. Vascular 3D measurements were done through 3D color/power histogram and expressed by Vascularization Index (VI) and Vascularization Flow Index (VFI). Volume of the embryo increased exponentially throughout the observation period. The VI and VFI showed no change despite an exponential growth of embryonic volume.

Resorption of the graft is the main problem, and several different procedures have been described to minimize this phenomenon. Using 25 New Zealand rabbits, the behavior of fat grafts in a highly vascularized recipient site was studied. The recipient sites prepared on the backs of the rabbits were divided into four regions. A capsule formation with silicone sheet application was accomplished in two of these recipient areas before the transplantation of the fat grafts. Fat grafts were placed in the other two recipient areas without any prior preparation. We prepared two types of fat tissue; in one the lobular structure was preserved and in the other it was manually crushed and rinsed with lactated Ringer's solution. The fat tissues with preserved lobular structure were placed in area I and area III. Manually crushed and rinsed fat tissues were placed in area II and area IV. In areas III and IV, a capsule formation with silicone sheet had been accomplished 3 weeks before grafting. Biopsy samples were obtained from these sites at the end of the first, third, sixth, and tenth months. Our aim was to observe the histologic fate of fat tissue in different recipient areas. The macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the fat grafts in areas with silicone sheet indicated significant differences in the resorption time of the fat grafts; however, it was concluded that the significant resorption of the transplanted autologous fat tissue grafts at the end of the first year was an inevitable consequence of fat grafting.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-04-05", "authors": ["Cihat NazmiBaran", "SelimCelebio\u011flu", "OmerSens\u00f6z", "G\u00fcrhanUlusoy", "BirolCivelek", "TurgutOrtak"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200204150-00023"}

The primary complication of this method is infection of the allograft, which can lead to limb loss in up to 50 percent of cases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of primary muscle flap coverage in the setting of allograft bone limb salvage surgery. This study is a prospective review of all patients with flap coverage of extremity allografts over the 10-year period 1991 to 2001. There were 20 patients (11 male and nine female patients) with an average age of 28 years (range, 6 to 72 years). Flap coverage was primary in 16 patients and delayed in four. Delayed coverage was performed for failed wounds that did not have a primary soft-tissue flap. Pathologic findings included osteosarcoma in nine patients, Ewing sarcoma in five patients, malignant fibrohistiocytoma in two patients, chondrosarcoma in two patients, synovial sarcoma in one patient, and leiomyosarcoma in one patient. Allograft reconstruction was performed for the upper extremity in 12 patients and for the lower extremity in eight patients. Flap reconstruction was accomplished with 20 pedicle flaps in 17 patients (latissimus dorsi, 12; gastrocnemius, four; soleus, three; and fasciocutaneous flap, one) and four free flaps (rectus abdominis, three; latissimus dorsi, one) in four patients. All pedicled flaps survived. There was one flap failure in the entire series, which was a free rectus abdominis flap. This case resulted in the only limb loss noted. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 50 months (average, 12.35 months). At the time of final follow-up, three patients were dead of disease and 17 were alive with intact extremities. The overall limb salvage rate in the setting of bone allograft and soft-tissue flap coverage was 95 percent (19 of 20). Reoperation for bone-related complications was required in 50 percent (two of four) of cases receiving delayed flap coverage compared with 19 percent (three of 16) of patients with primary flap coverage (statistically not significant). The results of this study support the use of soft-tissue flap coverage for allograft limb reconstruction. In this series, no limb was lost in the setting of a viable flap. Reoperation was markedly reduced in the setting of primary flap coverage.

In vitro, each protein in the family can bind DNA as a homo- or heterodimer with other family members. Mutational studies in mice have shown that Mitf is essential for melanocyte and eye development, whereas Tfeb is required for placental vascularization. Here, we uncover a role for Tfe3 in osteoclast development, a role that is functionally redundant with Mitf. Although osteoclasts seem normal in Mitf or Tfe3 null mice, the combined loss of the two genes results in severe osteopetrosis. We also show that Tfec mutant mice are phenotypically normal, and that the Tfec mutation does not alter the phenotype of Mitf, Tfeb, or Tfe3 mutant mice. Surprisingly, our studies failed to identify any phenotypic overlap between the different Mitf-Tfe mutations.

Perioperative CD154 blockade consisted of MR1 given on days -1, 1, and 3; long-term blockade consisted of MR1 given on days -1, 1, and 3 and continued twice weekly for 8 weeks. Allografts treated with perioperative or long-term CD154 blockade survived indefinitely. Perioperative and long-term treatment with control antibody (Ha4/8) resulted in uniform early rejection. Perioperative CD154 blockade transiently reduced early T-cell and macrophage infiltration in parallel with a transient reduction in endothelial adhesion receptor expression. Although perioperative CD154 blockade prevented allograft failure, it did not reduce allograft vasculopathy; mean neointimal cross-sectional area in perioperative MR1-treated and Ha4/8-treated recipients was 43+/-7% and 50+/-12%, respectively (P=NS).

{"title": "Analysis of robust innate immune response after transplantation in the absence of adaptive immunity.", "abstract": "Both animal models and clinical outcomes studies of transplantation suggest that antigen-independent mechanisms can alter graft survival and function. It has been suggested that antigen-independent processes interact with alloantigen-specific responses to augment the rejection reaction. A major link between antigen-specific adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory stimuli is innate immunity. During transplantation, innate immunity may be stimulated by multiple factors, including ischemia, reperfusion, sterile injury, systemic stress, and cell death.\nWe investigated the hypothesis that transplantation induces a potent innate immune response in a murine model of vascularized solid organ transplantation. In our studies, we analyzed three experimental groups: (a) alymphoid group in which both the donor and recipients strains lacked an adaptive immune response due to deletion of the recombinase activating gene, thus blocking production of both T cell and B cell antigen receptors; (b) syngeneic group in which the donors and recipients were genetically identical; and (c) allogeneic group in which the donors and recipients had a complete MHC mismatch. To analyze a large number of parameters we determined the level of expression of a panel of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and cell surface markers by RNase protection assays. In addition, serum cytokines were determined by ELISA and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was assessed by histology.\nOur results showed macrophage infiltration and up-regulation of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and chemokine receptors within the first day after transplantation in all groups, including the syngeneic and alymphoid recipients.\nOur study demonstrated a robust innate immune response that is independent of adaptive immunity and natural killer cell responses.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2002-03-30", "authors": ["HongzhenHe", "James RStone", "David LPerkins"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200203270-00005"}

We have reported on a non-human primate model of non-surgical in utero fetal ureteric obstruction that accurately reflects the human equivalent of obstructive renal dysplasia. A striking feature of this model is the effect of obstruction on normal glomerular development and podocyte survival.\nTo study the effect of urinary obstruction on glomerular development, kidneys were studied from fetuses undergoing unilateral ureteric obstruction by ultrasound guided injection of alginate beads as early as 75 days gestation (term gestation = 165 +/- 10 days). These kidneys displayed all the features of human obstructive cystic dysplasia, had reduced weights, and significant deficiencies in terminal ureteric duct branching.\nA combination of histochemistry, histomorphometry, and immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate deficient cortical ureteric duct development and branching, reduced glomerular number, and altered glomerular basement membrane formation with in utero urinary tract obstruction.\nThese data suggest that urinary tract obstruction during active nephrogenesis results in a defect in ureteric duct branching morphogenesis, and altered vascularization of the glomerulus with consequent podocyte dropout and decreased glomerular number.

Diagnostic imaging of paranasal sinus diseases].", "abstract": "The following article describes a diagnostic concept of paranasal sinus imaging, based on more than 10 years close collaboration of the authors. CT and MR are the primary imaging modalities for investigating paranasal sinus lesions. Conventional X-ray images add little information due to insufficient sensitivity. Angiography is restricted to those patients who require preoperative tumor embolization or emergency treatment of intractable epistaxis. After thorough medical treatment of inflammatory paranasal sinus disease, CT becomes the method of choice to clearly depict preoperative osseous anatomy and to distinguish between benign and malignant intraosseous lesions. In cases where trauma is involved, CT easily identifies anterior skull base fractures. Moreover, CT will be the first step to localize early or late CSF rhinorrhea. MR, with its ability to distinguish between different soft tissues, compliments CT. This holds particularly true for inflammatory or neoplastic disease close to the skull base, orbital apex and cavernous sinus. The signal intensity in T(1) and T(2) weighted images provides additional information with respect to cellularity and vascularization of lesions, which has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.", "journal": "Laryngo- rhino- otologie", "date": "2002-03-27", "authors": ["BSchuknecht", "DSimmen"], "doi": "10.1055/s-2002-23114"}

Two cases of extensive desmoid tumors, one at the trunk, one at the foot, both with compromised wound margins due to multiple previous surgeries, are presented.

{"title": "FLOOZY of petunia is a flavin mono-oxygenase-like protein required for the specification of leaf and flower architecture.", "abstract": "The mechanisms that determine the relative positions of floral organs, and thereby their numbers, is a poorly understood aspect of flower development. We isolated a petunia mutant, floozy (fzy), in which the formation of floral organ primordia in the outermost three floral whorls and one of the two bracts at the base of the flower is blocked at an early stage. In addition, fzy mutants fail to generate secondary veins in leaves and bracts and display a decreased apical dominance in the inflorescence. FZY encodes an enzyme with homology to flavin mono-oxygenases and appears to be the ortholog of YUCCA genes of Arabidopsis. FZY is expressed in young leafs and bracts and in developing flowers. In young floral meristems FZY is expressed in the center of the meristem dome and, later, expression becomes localized on the flanks of the initiating petal and stamen primordia and at several sites in maturing anthers and carpels. These findings indicate that FZY is involved in synthesizing a signaling compound that is required for floral organ initiation and specification of the vascularization pattern in leaves. Although fzy mutants contain normal auxin levels, ectopic expression of FZY results in excessive auxin accumulation, suggesting that the signaling compound is auxin.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2002-03-27", "authors": ["RafaelTobe\u00f1a-Santamaria", "MattijsBliek", "KarinLjung", "G\u00f6ranSandberg", "Joseph N MMol", "ErikSouer", "RonaldKoes"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.219502"}

{"title": "VEGF(121), VEGF(165) overexpression enhances tumorigenicity in U251 MG but not in NG-1 glioma cells.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a multifunctional cytokine with important roles in angiogenesis. VEGF is overexpressed in human cancers, including highly vascularized and infiltrative brain tumors. In our previous study of seven glioma cell lines, VEGF expression levels correlated with blood vessel density and tumorigenicity, and U251 MG and NG-1 cells were recognized as low-tumorigenic glioma cell lines. We hypothesized that low-tumorigenic cells can become highly tumorigenic when high levels of VEGF are expressed. To test this hypothesis, we constructed VEGF expression vectors containing 564 bp or 696 bp of VEGF(121) or VEGF(165) cDNA, respectively, and transfected them into U251 MG and NG-1 cells. In comparison to parental cells, the 20 VEGF-expressing clones examined had on average 8-10-fold more VEGF mRNA and 12-88-fold more secreted VEGF proteins. Four VEGF-overexpressing clones (U251 MG/V121-C2, U251 MG/V165-C3, NG-1/V121-C6, and NG-1/V165-C3) were selected for additional study. As VEGF production increased with population growth, U251 MG/V121-C2 and U251 MG/V165-C3 cells accumulated 47.9 and 22.0 ng of VEGF during a 5-day culture of 10(4) cells, a 313- and 144-fold overexpression when compared with that in parental U251 MG cells. NG-1/V121-C6 and NG-1/V165-C3 cells secreted 30.4 and 9.4 ng of VEGF, respectively, or 138- and 43-fold more than did the parental NG-1 cells. Subcutaneous implantation of the VEGF-overexpressing U251 MG cells into nude mice caused huge, soft hemorrhagic tumors to form, whereas controls maintained very small tumors. Intracranial implantation of the VEGF-overexpressing cell lines significantly shortened survival of the mice when compared with controls, and it caused formation of solid brain tumors with variable sized hemorrhages, whereas the controls had no apparent brain tumors. Tumorigenicity of U251 MG cells was synergized by co-overexpression of VEGF(121) and VEGF(165). In addition, VEGF(165) seemed to be more potent to the brain endothelium than was VEGF(121). More interestingly, except when an admixture of cells was implanted s.c., VEGF overexpression in NG-1 cells did not promote hemorrhagic tumor formation. These data suggested that a switch from a phenotype of low tumorigenicity to one of high tumorigenicity is possible when VEGF overexpression occurs, although other factors may also be required.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-03-26", "authors": ["Li DaoKe", "Yue-XiShi", "W K AlfredYung"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor isoform expression as a determinant of blood vessel patterning in human melanoma xenografts.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) occurs in at least five different isoforms because of alternative splicing of the gene. To investigate the roles of different VEGF isoforms in tumor blood vessel formation and tumorigenicity, the three major isoforms (VEGF(121), VEGF(165), and VEGF(189)) were overexpressed in an early-stage human melanoma cell line (WM1341B), which is VEGF-negative and nontumorigenic in immunodeficient mice. Although overexpression of VEGF(121) and VEGF(165) resulted in aggressive tumor growth, WM1341B cells transfected with VEGF(189) remained nontumorigenic and dormant on injection. Although tumor growth rate depended on the level and not the isoform of VEGF expressed, striking isoform-specific differences in vascular patterning were associated with VEGF(121)- versus VEGF(165)-dependent tumorigenic conversion of human melanoma. Thus, tumors overexpressing VEGF(165) generated dense, highly heterogeneous vessel networks that were distinctly different from those of tumors expressing VEGF(121) (poorly vascularized and necrotic). Paradoxically, although VEGF(165) expression appears to result in the most effective tumor perfusion, it is the expression of VEGF(121) that is observed during human malignant melanoma progression. Indeed, unbiased selection of spontaneously tumorigenic variants of WM1341B (by coinjection with Matrigel) led to predominant expression of the VEGF(121) isoform. The vascular patterning in these tumors (1341-P3N1, 1341-P3N2) resembled that of the VEGF(121)-transfected WM1341B tumors. These results suggest that, for reasons that remain to be elucidated, a \"minimal\" program of tumor vascularization may be favored during melanoma progression.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-03-26", "authors": ["Joanne LYu", "Janusz WRak", "GiannoulaKlement", "Robert SKerbel"], "doi": null}

Mechanisms regulating the expression of angiogenic factors in tumor cells are largely unknown. High expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA in neuroblastomas (NBs) is associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas TrkB is mainly expressed on aggressive, MYCN-amplified NBs. To investigate the biological effects of TrkA and TrkB expression on angiogenesis in NB, we examined the expression of angiogenic factors in the human NB cell line SY5Y and its TrkA and TrkB transfectants. In comparison with parental SY5Y cells, mRNA and protein levels of the examined angiogenic factors were significantly reduced in SY5Y-TrkA cells, whereas SY5Y-TrkB cells did not demonstrate a significant change. Conditioned medium of TrkB transfectants and parental SY5Y cells induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, but this effect was completely absent in SY5Y-TrkA cells. TrkA expression also resulted in severely impaired tumorigenicity in a mouse xenograft model and was associated with reduced angiogenic factor expression and vascularization of tumors, as determined by immunohistochemistry and an in vivo Matrigel assay. TrkA expression inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in SY5Y NB cells by down-regulation of angiogenic factors, whereas expression of TrkB does not down-regulate the production of these angiogenic factors. The biologically different behavior of TrkA- and TrkB-expressing NBs may be explained in part by their effects on angiogenesis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-03-26", "authors": ["AngelikaEggert", "Michael AGrotzer", "NaohikoIkegaki", "Xing-geLiu", "Audrey EEvans", "Garrett MBrodeur"], "doi": null}

This study examined the role of CMV and the alloreactive response in the development of TVS using bone marrow chimerism (BMC) in rat small bowel (SB) and heart transplantation models.\nFisher 344 (F344) rat heart or SB grafts were transplanted into F344/Lewis bone marrow chimera.

The effect of rat CMV (RCMV) (5x105 plaque-forming units) on TVS (neointimal index, NI) and graft survival was studied in these groups. RCMV infection was assessed by serologic analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques (TaqMan).\nRCMV infection accelerated the time to graft CR (SB 70-38 days; hearts 90-45 days) and increased the severity of TVS in both the SB allografts (day 38, NI=27 vs. 52) and the heart allografts (day 45, NI=43 vs. 83).

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects.

Given interest in regulating the effector functions of T cells in vivo, we examined the role of LIGHT-HVEM costimulation in a murine cardiac allograft rejection model. Normal hearts lacked LIGHT or HVEM mRNA expression, but allografts showed strong expression of both genes from day 3 after transplant, and in situ hybridization and immunohistology-localized LIGHT and HVEM to infiltrating leukocytes. To test the importance of LIGHT expression on allograft survival, we generated LIGHT-/- mice by homologous recombination.

{"title": "Microtumor growth initiates angiogenic sprouting with simultaneous expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor-2, and angiopoietin-2.", "abstract": "Tumors have been thought to initiate as avascular aggregates of malignant cells that only later induce vascularization. Recently, this classic concept of tumor angiogenesis has been challenged by the suggestion that tumor cells grow by co-opting preexisting host vessels and thus initiate as well-vascularized tumors without triggering angiogenesis. To discriminate between these two mechanisms, we have used intravital epifluorescence microscopy and multi-photon laser scanning confocal microscopy to visualize C6 microglioma vascularization and tumor cell behavior. To address the mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, we assessed the expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), as well as endothelial cell proliferation. We show that multicellular aggregates (<< 1 mm(3)) initiate vascular growth by angiogenic sprouting via the simultaneous expression of VEGFR-2 and Ang-2 by host and tumor endothelium. Host blood vessels are not co-opted by tumor cells but rather are used as trails for tumor cell invasion of the host tissue. Our data further suggest that the established microvasculature of growing tumors is characterized by a continuous vascular remodeling, putatively mediated by the expression of VEGF and Ang-2. The results of this study suggest a new concept of vascular tumor initiation that may have important implications for the clinical application of antiangiogenic strategies.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2002-03-20", "authors": ["PeterVajkoczy", "MohammadFarhadi", "AndreasGaumann", "ReginaHeidenreich", "RalfErber", "AndreasWunder", "J\u00f6rg CTonn", "Michael DMenger", "GeorgBreier"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI14105"}

We have further used these animals to investigate the morphology and cell biology of the endocrine pancreas in late gestation and at birth when insulin is absent throughout development. Pancreatic beta-cells were identified by detecting the activity of the LacZ gene inserted at the Ins2 locus. A significant increase in the mean area of the islets was found at embryonic d 18.5 (E18.5) and in the newborn in Ins1-/-, Ins2-/- animals compared with Ins1-/-, Ins2+/- and wild-type controls, whereas the blood glucose levels were unaltered. The individual size of the beta-cells in the insulin-deficient fetuses was similar to controls, suggesting that the relative increase in islet size was due to an increase in cell number. Immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen within the pancreatic ductal epithelium showed no differences in labeling index between insulin-deficient and control mice, and no change in the number of beta-cells associated with ducts, but the relative size distribution of the islets was altered so that fewer islets under 5,000 microm(2) and more islets greater than 10,000 microm(2) were present in Ins1-/-, Ins2-/- animals. This suggests that the greater mean islet size seen in insulin-deficient animals represented an enlargement of formed islets and was not associated with an increase in islet neogenesis. The proportional contribution of alpha- and beta-cells to the islets was not altered. This was supported by an increase in the number of cells containing immunoreactive proliferating cell nuclear antigen in both islet alpha- and beta-cells at E18.5 in insulin-deficient mice, and a significantly lower incidence of apoptotic cells, as determined by molecular histochemistry using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP nick end labeling reaction. The density of blood vessels within sections of whole pancreas, or within islets, was determined by immunohistochemistry for the endothelial cell marker CD31 and was found to be increased 2-fold in insulin-deficient mice compared with controls at E18.5. However, no changes were found in the steady-state expression of mRNAs encoding vascular endothelial growth factor, its receptor Flk-1, IGF-I or -II, the IGF-I and insulin receptors, or insulin receptor substrates-1 or -2 in pancreata from Ins1-/-, Ins2-/- mice compared with Ins1-/-, Ins2+/- controls. Thus, we conclude that the relative hyperplasia of the islets in late gestation in the insulin-deficient mice was due to an increased islet cell proliferation coupled with a reduced apoptosis, which may be related to an increased vascularization of the pancreas.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2002-03-19", "authors": ["BDuvilli\u00e9", "CCurrie", "TChrones", "DBucchini", "JJami", "R LJoshi", "D JHill"], "doi": "10.1210/endo.143.4.8753"}

Even persistently high levels of activated tumor-specific T lymphocytes fail to eradicate the tumors. In contrast, we show that irradiation before adoptive transfer results in complete macroscopic tumor regression. Thus, effective tumor therapy requires a proinflammatory microenvironment that permits T cells to extravasate and to destroy the tumor. Early after initiation of the irradiation/adoptive transfer therapy, the capillary network reacquires an almost normal appearance, a likely consequence of strong induction of the chemokines monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig) and IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP10). This remodeling of the vasculature in a proinflammatory environment may directly affect lymphocyte extravasation and effector function.

In this study, gene transfer using an adenovirus vector encoding the hepatocyte growth factor gene (AdHGF) was used to induce blood vessel formation in tissue-engineered meniscus.

Fourteen patients who had large (> 150 cm2) preexisting defects of the cranium or cranio-orbital region underwent surgical reconstruction. Preoperatively, a three-dimensional computed tomographic scan was obtained from which an anatomic model was fabricated. The defect in the model was then used to create an alloplastic (hard tissue-replacement polymer) implant for reconstruction and surgical placement. At the time of surgery, the implant was secured into position with either metal or resorbable fixation. In cases where the frontal sinus was in proximity to the implant, the frontal sinus was either cranialized and covered with a pericranial flap or obliterated with hydroxyapatite cement. In cases that had been previously irradiated or infected, wide bony debridement and coverage with a vascularized muscle was initially performed, followed by implant reconstruction 6 months later. All implants fit easily into the bone defects, and only four (29 percent) required some minor adjustments to complete the fit. All patients healed uneventfully. With a minimum of 1 year follow-up (average, 3 years) in all cases, excellent contours have been maintained and all patients have remained infection-free. In large cranial defects, custom implants fabricated from porous, hydrophilic hard-tissue replacement polymer provide an exacting anatomic fit and a solid stable reconstruction. This method of reconstruction in these defects is rapid and exact, and significantly reduces operative time.

To address this question, we employed immortalized murine hepatocytes, which display a high degree of differentiation and, expectedly, arrest in the G1 phase under exposure to TGF-beta1. These hepatocytes maintain epithelial polarization upon expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras. However, Ras-transformed hepatocytes rapidly convert to a spindle-shaped, fibroblastoid morphology upon treatment with TGF-beta1, which no longer inhibits proliferation. This epithelial to fibroblastoid conversion (EFC) is accompanied by disruption of intercellular contacts and remodeling of the cytoskeletal framework. Fibroblastoid derivatives form elongated branching cords in collagen gels and grow to severely vascularized tumors in vivo, indicating their increased malignancy and even invasive phenotype. Additionally, fibroblastoid cells secrete strongly enhanced levels of TGF-beta1, suggesting an autocrine regulation of TGF-beta signaling. Expression profiling further revealed that the loss of the adhesion component E-cadherin correlates with the upregulation of its transcriptional repressor Snail in fibroblastoid cells. Moreover, the phosphoinositide 3-OH (PI3) kinase pathway was required for the maintenance of EFC, as inhibition of PI3 kinase reverted fibroblastoid cells to an epithelial-like phenotype. Taken together, these data indicate a dual role of TGF-beta1 in hepatocytes: it induces proliferation arrest but provides a crucial function in promoting late malignant events in collaboration with activated Ha-Ras.", "journal": "Journal of cell science", "date": "2002-03-09", "authors": ["JosefGotzmann", "HeidemarieHuber", "ChristianeThallinger", "MarkusWolschek", "BurkhardJansen", "RolfSchulte-Hermann", "HartmutBeug", "WolfgangMikulits"], "doi": "10.1242/jcs.115.6.1189"}

Thus, we examined the effects of coexistence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension on AVV formation. In Wistar rats, hypercholesterolemia was established by high-cholesterol diet from Day -14 (HC rats), and hypertension was induced by a suprarenal aortic constriction at Day 0 (HT rats). At Day 28, we studied AVV density, adventitial area, and medial thickness in the ascending aorta of control (standard diet+sham operation), HC, HT, and HC+HT rats (n=5/group). In HC rats, although the adventitial area was modestly increased, the AVV density and medial thickness were unchanged versus controls. In addition to medial thickening, marked enlargement of the adventitial area accompanied by increased AVV density was observed in HT rats, compared with controls. HC+HT rats showed lower AVV density, despite larger adventitial area, than HT rats, whereas the medial thickness was similar in HT and HC+HT rats. Immunohistostaining revealed hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in the media only in HC+HT rats but not in the other 3 groups, suggesting persistent medial hypoxia in HC+HT rats.

{"title": "Thymic re-entry of mature activated T cells and increased negative selection in vascularized allograft recipients.", "abstract": "Transplantation tolerance is a dynamic state that involves several homeostatic mechanisms intrinsic to the host. One of these mechanisms is activation-induced T cell death (AICD). However, it is unclear where AICD takes place during alloreactive responses. Since activated T cells can re-enter the thymus, we hypothesized that mature T cells activated by an allograft could be deleted upon re-entry into the thymus. To test this hypothesis, we used wild-type or 2C TCR transgenic mice receiving syngeneic or allogeneic heterotopic, vascularized heart grafts. First, we demonstrated that ex vivo CFSE-labelled T cells re-entered the thymus when transferred into allograft recipients but not when transferred into isograft recipients. Next, we compared the changes in cell subset numbers and incidence of apoptosis in the thymi and spleens of allograft or isograft recipients. Seven days after transplantation, at a time in which all the allografts were undergoing rejection, cells expressing donor-MHC class II molecules had migrated to the thymus and to the spleen. In the thymus of allograft recipients, overall cellularity was significantly reduced by 40% and associated with an increase in the number of double negative (CD4-CD8-) thymocytes and a decrease in double positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes, consistent with increased negative selection of thymocytes. Additionally, thymi of allograft recipients showed an increase in the number of recently activated, mature T cells (TCRhi, CD25+, CD44+) and a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells, especially in the thymic medulla, that involved mature T cells as indicated by the TCRhi, CD44+, CD4 or CD8 single positive phenotype. Spleens of allograft recipients were increased in size and cellularity but did not show any of the changes in cell subsets seen in the thymi. Our data show that after allografting there is an increase in apoptotic cell death that is associated with negative selection of developing thymocytes as well as of alloreactive mature T cells that have re-entered the thymus upon activation in the periphery.

Remaining (rebound) mice were maintained without treatment for 3 more weeks. Patterns of vasculature and apoptosis were determined immunohistochemically.\nTumor weights at 6 weeks were reduced significantly in topotecan-only (0.07g) and combination-treated animals (0.08 g), compared with controls or anti-VEGF--treated mice (1.18 g, 0.53 g; P <.0007, all). At 9 weeks, rebound tumor weights were greatest in anti-VEGF (2.82 g), intermediate in topotecan (1.82 g), and least in combination-treated animals (1.47 g); however, the only significant difference was between anti-VEGF and combination therapy (P = 0.04). All treated tumors were vascularized sparsely in comparison with controls at 6 weeks, but exhibited brisk neoangiogenesis at 9 weeks.\nTopotecan either with or without anti-VEGF antibody significantly suppresses neuroblastoma xenograft growth in comparison with controls or anti-VEGF antibody alone. Combining topotecan with anti-VEGF antibody significantly inhibited rebound tumor growth in comparison with anti-VEGF antibody alone.

Non-ovariectomized non-PMSG-treated animals served as controls. During a 2 week period after transplantation, neovascularization of these freely transplanted grafts was quantified in vivo by assessment of the newly developed microvascular follicular network, its microvessel density, the diameter of microvessels and their volumetric blood flow using fluorescence microscopic techniques. At day 3 after transplantation, capillary sprouts could be observed in all groups studied, finally developing a complete glomerulum-like microvascular network within 5-10 days. In ovariectomized animals, however, vascularization of follicular tissue was found to be accelerated and enhanced when compared with the follicles in both groups of non-ovariectomized animals. This was associated with significantly higher capillary blood perfusion, which may in part represent the graft's adaptive response to pro-angiogenic stimuli due to elevated gonadotropin levels, but might in particular be mediated by gonadotropin-induced release of vasoactive substances. Interestingly, small preantral follicles lacking a theca interna failed to vascularize in either of the groups.

The principal anatomic and biological feature of the cornea that determines the immunologic privilege of this tissue is its avascularity. The surgical trauma of transplantation compromises the immunologic privilege, putting corneal allografts at risk for immune rejection. During the past 50 yr, rabbits, rats, and mice have been used extensively in the study of the process of immunologically mediated corneal allograft rejection. It is clear that the inflammation and neovascularization of the graft that occurs following transplantation predisposes a corneal allograft to the classic cell-mediated immune rejection response. The antigenicity of cornea cells has been studied and has been found to be significantly lower compared to other cells and tissues. Rejection of acorneal allograft is acell-mediated process directed against major histocompatibility complex antigens involving both CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic cells. The prevention of corneal allograft rejection depends on the development of topically applied compounds that can prevent inflammation and vascularization and inhibit the activation of T lymphocytes. Considerable progress has been made using immunomodulators, including blocking antibodies and soluble coreceptor blocking agents such as CTLA4-Ig.

Little attention so far has been given to a possible pathogenetic interplay between CMV and lymphomas. CMV inhibits stem cell engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution. Thus, by causing maintenance of bone marrow aplasia and immunodeficiency, CMV could promote tumor relapse. Alternatively, CMV could aid tumor remission. One might think of cytopathogenic infection of tumor cells, induction of apoptosis or inhibitory cytokines, interference with tumor cell extravasation or tumor vascularization, or bystander stimulation of an antitumoral immune response. To approach these questions, the established model of experimental BMT and murine CMV infection was extended by the introduction of liver-infiltrating, highly tumorigenic variant clone E12E of BALB/c-derived B-cell lymphoma A20. We document a remarkable retardation of lymphoma progression. First-guess explanations were ruled out: (i) lymphoma cells were not infected; (ii) lymphoma cells located next to infected hepatocytes did not express executioner caspase 3 but were viable and proliferated; (iii) an inhibitory effect of virus on the formation of tumor nodules in the liver became apparent by day 7 after BMT, long before the reconstitution of immune cells; and (iv) recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) did not substitute for virus; accordingly anti-TNF-alpha did not prevent the inhibition. Notably, while the antitumoral effect required replicative virus, prevention of cytopathogenic infection of the liver by antiviral CD8 T cells did not abolish lymphoma control.

To assess this approach in an animal model of arthritis, we compared intra-articular injections of an adenovirus producing rat IL-13 (AxCArIL-13), a control virus, and rat ankles receiving phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). We demonstrate that IL-13 levels are normally low in ankles throughout the course of rat AIA. We show that administration of AxCArIL-13 before arthritis onset significantly reduces ankle circumference, paw volume, bony destruction, the number of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), the quantity of blood vessels, and levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in ankles. When administered as a treatment to inflamed ankles, AxCArIL-13 decreases articular index scores, paw volumes, bony destruction, vascularization, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, and the quantity of monocytes, lymphocytes, and PMNs. Thus, increasing IL-13 levels significantly ameliorates the course of rat AIA, suggesting that similar strategies for the treatment of human RA are worthy of further study.", "journal": "Human gene therapy", "date": "2002-02-28", "authors": ["James MWoods", "M AsifAmin", "Kenneth JKatschke", "Michael VVolin", "Jeffrey HRuth", "Matthew AConnors", "Drew CWoodruff", "HirokazuKurata", "Ken-IchiArai", "G KennethHaines", "PawanKumar", "Alisa EKoch"], "doi": "10.1089/10430340252792512"}
{"title": "Characterization of mast cells according to their content of tryptase and chymase in normal and neoplastic human uterine cervix.", "abstract": "Mast cells (MC) have been associated with diverse human cancers. The primary function of these cells is to store and release a number of biologically active mediators, including the serine proteases tryptase and chymase. These proteases have been closely related with angiogenesis and tumor invasion, two critical steps during tumor progression. In the present work we analyzed the presence of MC in human uterine cervix from both normal and neoplastic tissues by using metachromatic, immunohistochemical, and enzymohistochemical staining. Tryptase-positive (MCT)- and tryptase/chymase-positive (MCTC)-mast cells were found in both normal and neoplastic tissues. The phenotype predominantly expressed in normal tissues as well as in benign and malignant lesions of the uterine cervix was the MCT. The total number of MC remained constant through the different stages of malignant transformation (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1-3) but a significant increase in the invasive carcinoma (IC) group was observed, this increase being mainly due to the MCT phenotype. Furthermore, we detected abundant MCT but not MCTC infiltrating tumors in sections of IC. Regarding the potent angiogenic properties described for tryptase, these findings suggest that in advanced stages of malignancy the significant number of MCT distributed within the cervical tissues could provide an effective mechanism to create the abundantly vascularized microenvironment required for tumor cells to proliferate and disseminate.", "journal": "International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society", "date": "2002-02-28", "authors": ["ACabanillas-Saez", "J ASchalper", "S MNicovani", "Maria IsoldeRudolph"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1525-1438.2002.01082.x"}

Low-energy shock waves of 1000 impulses at 14 kV (equivalent to 0.18 mJ/mm2 energy flux density) were applied to the right Achilles bone-tendon junction. Biopsies were taken from the middle one-third of the Achilles tendon-bone junction at 4 weeks and from the lateral one-third at 8 weeks, respectively, after shock wave application. The features of microscopic examination included the number of new capillaries and muscularized vessels, the presence and arrangements of myofibroblasts, and the changes in bone. New capillary and muscularized vessels were seen in the study specimens which were obtained in 4 weeks and in 8 weeks after shock wave application, but none were seen in the control specimens before shock wave application. There was a considerable geographic variation in the number of new vessels within the same specimen. Myofibroblasts were not seen in the control specimens. Myofibroblasts with haphazard appearance and intermediate orientation fibers were seen in all study specimens obtained at 4 weeks and predominantly intermediate orientation myofibroblast fibers at 8 weeks.

The second step of MMP-2 activation that yields to the mature form is less understood and could involve an autocatalytic process and/or the activity of the plasminogen/plasmin system. Human melanoma A2058 cells, which express MMP-2 only in its pro-form, were used to determine the role of MT1-MMP during pericellular proteolysis and tumor progression. The induction of MT1-MMP overexpression by MT1-MMP cDNA transfection initiated the first step of MMP-2 activation. We provide evidence that a cooperation between the plasminogen/plasmin system and MT1-MMP endowed the cells with the ability to fully activate MMP-2 and with enhanced invasive properties in vitro. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, MT1-MMP expressing clones induced rapid tumor growth and high tumor vascularization, while the control clones were poorly or not tumorigenic.

Angiogenesis in the RIPTag mouse model, as well as in human cancer, is a hallmark of multistage tumorigenesis and precedes the development of solid tumors. In our study, intravital microscopy was used to monitor changes in the blood vessel phenotype, microcirculation and leukocyte adhesion during the progression from normal islets to angiogenic islets and solid tumors. In RIP1-Tag5 mice, an aberrant microangioarchitecture becomes apparent in early stages during spontaneous tumor development. Notably, the transition from normal to angiogenic islets is characterized by an increase in vessel diameter rather than vessel numbers. Thus, dilatation of existing vessels precedes vessel sprouting. Once initiated, neovascularization in angiogenic islets results in loss of vessel hierarchy and differentiation. Solid insulinomas display a higher vessel density and even more dramatic vessel heterogeneity as revealed by local \"hot spots\" of neovascularization and irregular vessel diameters. Strikingly, profound changes in the microangioarchitecture are already observed in early angiogenic islets suggesting that key features of the angiogenic vasculature are established prior to the expansion of tumor mass. Moreover, adhesion of leukocytes was found to be dramatically decreased in both angiogenic islets and solid tumors and correlates with morphological alterations of the vasculature. Thus, vessel transformation and reduced leukocyte-endothelium interactions are not exclusively features of solid tumors but represent early events during tumorigenesis.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2002-02-22", "authors": ["EduardRyschich", "JanSchmidt", "G\u00fcnter JH\u00e4mmerling", "ErnstKlar", "RuthGanss"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.10074"}

The authors hypothesized that tumor proliferation, spread, and recurrence are angiogenesis dependent and investigated the significance of vascularization relative to biologic behavior. To the authors' knowledge, angiogenesis for patients with craniopharyngiomas has not been examined to date.\nThe authors measured microvessel densities in resected, histologically proven craniopharyngiomas using immunostains for CD-34, a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes endothelial cells. Both histologic types of craniopharyngiomas, adamantinomatous and papillary, were included in the study. In addition, the cellular distribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a strong stimulator of new vessel formation, was assessed by both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) mRNA expression.\nHistologically, small numbers of capillaries were identified in temporal stroma but not in their epithelial components. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong, conclusive cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for VEGF in the epithelial cells of both adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas and papillary craniopharyngiomas. In situ hybridization showed that VEGFR-2 mRNA was expressed widely, not only in neoplastic epithelium but also in capillary endothelium.\nTumors with greater microvessel density regrow more frequently compared with tumors that have lower microvessel density, suggesting that the extent of angiogenesis is of prognostic value in patients with craniopharyngioma.

The proto-oncogene LMO2 encodes a LIM domain transcription regulator which controls angiogenesis during mouse embryogenesis where it regulates remodelling of the capillary network into mature vessels. We now show that Lmo2 expression is augmented in tumour endothelium such as mouse thymomas and human lung tumours. The functional significance of this Lmo2 expression was assessed in teratocarcinomas induced in nude mice by subcutaneous implantation of Lmo2-lacZ targeted ES cells. CD31-positive, sprouting endothelium of ES-cell origin occurred in teratocarcinomas from heterozygous Lmo2-lacZ ES cells but none occurred from null Lmo2-lacZ ES cells.

Given that blockade of alpha(v)-integrins during angiogenesis induces p53 activity, we utilized p53 null mice to elucidate whether loss of p53 can compensate for alpha(v)-integrin function in neovascularization of the retina. Murine retinal vascularization was inhibited by systemic administration of an alpha(v)-integrin antagonist. In contrast, mice lacking p53 were refractory to this treatment, indicating that neovascularization in normal mice depends on alpha(v)-integrin-mediated suppression of p53. Blockade of alpha(v)-integrins during neovascularization resulted in an induction of p21(CIP1) in wild type and, surprisingly, in p53 null retinas, indicating that alpha(v)-integrin ligation regulates p21(CIP1) levels in a p53-independent manner.

Because immunosuppressive agents such as CsA induce significant side effects, including bone loss, other therapeutic agents supporting successful vascularized bone allografts have been sought after. We investigated the effects of 22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (OCT) on vascularized bone allograft, and compared its effects with CsA. Twelve-week-old DA rats with the major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) RT-1(a) were used as donors and age-matched Lewis rats with MHC RT-1(l) used as recipients. Allografted bones in rats treated with vehicle were rejected completely. Soft X-ray examination demonstrated that administration of OCT (0.5 microg/kg per day) for 12 weeks after bone graft induced bone union as effective as treatment for 12 weeks with CsA (10 mg/kg per day). Transplanted bones in OCT-treated rats showed higher bone mineral density than that in CsA-treated rats. Histologically, transplanted bones in OCT-treated rats at 12 weeks were nonvital, but these bones united with recipient vital bones. After cessation of 12 week treatment with OCT, new bone formation occurred around the grafted nonvital bones during a 9 month period. Transplanted bones in CsA-treated rats were vital and formed union with recipient bones, whereas cortical bones became thin when compared with nonvital bones in OCT-treated rats. Urinary deoxypyridinoline levels in rats treated with CsA were significantly higher than levels in rats treated with OCT, suggesting accelerated bone resorption in CsA-treated rats.

Patients and methods The study comprised 113 children undergoing urethrocutaneous fistula repair between 1984 and 1996. Most of the fistulae were closed in two to three layers, with or without a transpositional skin flap. Tunica vaginalis or a scrotal dartos flap was used in patients with inadequate vascularized tissue adjacent to the fistula. Success rates were calculated for each attempt at fistula repair until the patient was cured. Results The median (range) age at primary fistula repair was 40 (18-169) months and the median follow-up after the most recent repair 7.5 (2.3-17) years. The overall success rate of primary fistula repair was 71%. Fistulae which were >2 mm (11 of 21, 52%) were more likely to recur than were those < or = 2 mm (22 of 92, 24%). Recurrence did not relate to the initial form of hypospadias repair, to the means of skin closure nor, with the exception of multiple lesions, to the location of the fistula. The success rates of subsequent repairs were 70% at the second and 50% at the third, fourth and fifth repairs. One child was cured at the sixth attempt. The use of tunica vaginalis or scrotal dartos as a 'waterproofing' layer was limited to the third or subsequent repairs and was successful in five of six cases. Conclusion A simple layered closure with or with no transpositional skin flap is effective in 71% of repairs.

{"title": "Pulmonary barotrauma-induced cerebral arterial gas embolism with spontaneous recovery: commentary on the rationale for therapeutic compression.", "abstract": "Pulmonary barotrauma-induced cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) continues to complicate compressed gas diving activities. Inadequate lung ventilation secondary to inadvertent breath holding or rapid buoyant ascent can quickly generate a critical state of lung over-pressure. Pulmonary over-pressurization may also occur as a consequence of acute and chronic pulmonary pathologies. Resulting barotrauma frequently causes structural failure within the terminal distal airway. Respiratory gases are then free to embolize the systemic circulation via the pulmonary vasculature and the left heart. The brain is a common target organ. Bubbles that enter the cerebral arteries coalesce to form columns of gas as the vascular network narrows. Small amounts of gas frequently pass directly through the cerebral circulation without occlusion. Larger columns of gas occlude regional brain blood flow, either transiently or permanently, producing a stroke-like clinical picture. In cases of spontaneous redistribution, a period of apparent recovery is frequently followed by relapse. The etiology of relapse appears to be multifactoral, and chiefly the consequence of a failure of reperfusion. Prediction of who will relapse is not possible, and any such relapse is of ominous prognostic significance. It is advisable, therefore, that CAGE patients who undergo spontaneous recovery be promptly recompressed while breathing oxygen. Therapeutic compression will serve to antagonize leukocyte-mediated ischemia-reperfusion injury; limit potential re-embolization of brain blood flow, secondary to further leakage from the original pulmonary lesion or recirculation of gas from the initial occlusive event; protect against embolic injury to other organs; aid in the resolution of component cerebral edema; reduce the likelihood of late brain infarction reported in patients who have undergone spontaneous clinical recovery; and prophylax against decompression sickness in high gas loading dives that precede accelerated ascents and omitted stage decompression.", "journal": "Aviation, space, and environmental medicine", "date": "2002-02-16", "authors": ["DClarke", "WGerard", "TNorris"], "doi": null}

Moreover, we have demonstrated that Cyr61 induces tumor formation and tumor vascularization in vivo, events mediated through the activation of the MAPK and the Akt signaling pathways. Here we investigate how Cyr61 expression is regulated in both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that Cyr61 mRNA and protein expression is inducible by estrogen and anti-estrogens in ER-positive breast cancer cells. We show that a labile protein as well as a negative regulator might be involved in Cyr61 expression in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Other important regulators of Cyr61 expression in breast cancer cells that we found are the phorbol ester TPA, vitamin D, and retinoic acid. TPA causes positive regulation of Cyr61 expression in ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Vitamin D induces a transient stimulatory effect on Cyr61 gene expression. Lastly, retinoic acid has a negative effect on Cyr61 expression and downregulates its expression in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, most of these effects are not seen in aggressive breast cancer cells that do not express ER and express high levels of Cyr61, such as the MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results are in agreement with our knowledge that Cyr61 promotes tumor growth, and that tumor-promoting agents have a positive impact on cells that express low levels of Cyr61, such as the ER-positive breast cancer cells; however, these agents have no significant effect on cells that express high levels of Cyr61. Our findings suggest an association between increased Cyr61 expression and an aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2002-02-13", "authors": ["Miaw-SheueTsai", "Daphne FBogart", "PatriciaLi", "InderjitMehmi", "RuthLupu"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1205131"}
{"title": "Hypoxia-induced, perinecrotic expression of endothelial Per-ARNT-Sim domain protein-1/hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha correlates with tumor progression, vascularization, and focal macrophage infiltration in bladder cancer.", "abstract": "Endothelial Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain protein-1 (EPAS-1)/hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS domain protein family and is considered to be an endothelial-specific, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. Because hypoxia is a fundamental element of tumor biology determining clinical outcome, we performed an immunohistochemical study of EPAS-1 expression in a cohort of bladder cancer cases and assessed the possible correlation of EPAS-1 expression with tumor hypoxia and growth. In the 67 cases (37 radical cystectomy and 30 transurethral resection) studied, overexpression of EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha protein was not found in cancer cells or in normal tissues but was mostly found in stroma around cancer cells, and strong positive staining was noted in perinecrotic regions. The perinecrotic/tumorous expression of EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha was correlated statistically with higher histological grade (P < 0.001), advanced pathological T stage (P < 0.001), and presence of necrosis (P < 0.001). A parallel immunohistochemical analysis of a marker gene of vascular endothelial growth factor demonstrated its positive correlation with tumor grade, stage, and EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha overexpression, supporting the correlation of EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha up-regulation with tumor angiogenesis. To further clarify the relationship between hypoxia and vascularity in the perinecrotic/tumorous area with EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha expression, tissue microvessel density (MVD) was assessed. No significant correlation (P = 0.442) was found between EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha expression and MVD if the 67 tumors of different stages were all included. However, EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha-positive cases had lower MVD than EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha-negative cases (P = 0.001) if only invasive cancer cases were analyzed. In addition, in all EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha-positive staining cases, EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha-positive foci had lower MVD than EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha-negative foci (P < 0.001). Finally, using serial sections, the location of EPAS-1/HIF 2alpha expression was identified mainly in tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) as well as in some fibroblast cells. Focal TAM infiltration was identified at a higher level in EPAS-1-positive cases than EPAS-1-negative cases (P < 0.001). This is the first clinical report suggesting that hypoxia-induced, perinecrotic EPAS-1/HIF-2alpha expression is correlated with tumor progression and angiogenesis at higher grade and stage through focal TAM infiltration in invasive bladder cancer.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2002-02-13", "authors": ["ToruOnita", "Ping GuangJi", "Jim WXuan", "HidekiSakai", "HiroshiKanetake", "Patrick HMaxwell", "Guo-HuaFong", "Manal YGabril", "MadeleineMoussa", "Joseph LChin"], "doi": null}

We investigated the effect of the statins cerivastatin and atorvastatin on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.\nEndothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation were enhanced at low concentrations (0.005 to 0.01 micromol/L) but significantly inhibited at high statin concentrations (0.05 to 1 micromol/L). Antiangiogenic effects at high concentrations were associated with decreased endothelial release of vascular endothelial growth factor and increased endothelial apoptosis and were reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In murine models, inflammation-induced angiogenesis was enhanced with low-dose statin therapy (0.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) but significantly inhibited with high concentrations of cerivastatin or atorvastatin (2.5 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). Despite the fact that high-dose statin treatment was effective at reducing lipid levels in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, it impaired rather than enhanced angiogenesis. Finally, high-dose cerivastatin decreased tumor growth and tumor vascularization in a murine Lewis lung cancer model.\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibition has a biphasic dose-dependent effect on angiogenesis that is lipid independent and associated with alterations in endothelial apoptosis and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling.

We have evaluated the effects of VEGF overexpression on the histology and growth rate of human ovarian cancer xenografts. OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells were stably transfected with an expression vector encoding the 165-amino acid isoform of VEGF. As subcutaneous xenografts, moderately and highly VEGF(165)-overexpressing OVCAR-3 cells formed tumors with large cysts. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increase in the number of CD31-positive microvessels, some of which were larger in diameter than those in the parental tumors, as well as extensive vascular rimming around the cysts. Weakly VEGF(165)-overexpressing tumors also contained an increased number of CD31-positive microvessels and occasional vascular rimming, but cysts were not present. Immunohistochemistry further revealed the presence of monocytes and macrophages in both parental and VEGF(165)-overexpressing xenografts. Interestingly, the number of monocytes/macrophages was greatly increased in moderately and highly VEGF(165)-overexpressing xenografts and large areas populated with monocytes/macrophages were detected within the tumor stroma. Although the higher number of CD31-positive cells would suggest a better vascularization pattern in VEGF(165)-overexpressing xenografts, tumor growth rates were not increased when compared with that of parental xenografts.

The fascial graft was covered directly by subcutaneous tissue (Group I) or by a silicone sheet to prevent tissue ingrowth from the subcutaneous tissue (Group II). The ePTFE sheet was covered with a silicone sheet (Group III). One or 2 weeks postoperatively, the strength of the dural repair was evaluated by determining the pressure at which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaked through the wound margins. The dural repair was also histologically examined. In addition, using a rat model, specimens obtained from similar reconstruction sites were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor, or transforming growth factor-beta.

{"title": "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is markedly expressed in active and early-stage endometriotic lesions.", "abstract": "The establishment of a new vascular supply is essential for the survival of endometrial tissue and its development in ectopic locations. We have previously shown that ectopic endometrial cells release an important mitogenic activity for human endothelial cells and identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as one of the principal bioactive molecules involved in endothelial cell proliferation. In the present study, immunohistochemical and dual immunofluorescence analyses showed that MIF is effectively expressed by endometriotic tissue, particularly in the glands, and identified endothelial cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes as cells markedly expressing MIF in the stroma. Western blot analysis showed a single 12.5-kDa band corresponding to the known mol wt of the molecule. The highest concentrations of MIF protein in endometriotic tissue, as measured by ELISA, were found in flame-like red endometriotic lesions, compared with typical black-bluish (P < 0.01) or with white lesions (P < 0.01). Interestingly, MIF displayed a marked expression in lesions from the initial stage of endometriosis (stage I). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of MIF mRNA levels in the same endometriotic tissues showed a pattern of expression comparable with that of the protein. In view of its potent proinflammatory and angiogenic properties, local production of MIF within endometrial implants, particularly in those that are highly vascularized and representing the earliest and most active forms of the disease, make plausible the involvement of this factor in the local immunoinflammatory process observed in endometriosis and the initial steps of endometriotic tissue growth and development.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "date": "2002-02-12", "authors": ["RouslanKats", "Christine NMetz", "AliAkoum"], "doi": "10.1210/jcem.87.2.8260"}

In such instances, jejunal transfer using a muscle flap as a \"vascular carrier\" may be a problem-solving alternative. Pretransfer vascularization of the jejunum is achieved by wrapping the muscle flap around the small bowel segment. After a short staging period, the mesenteric pedicle is divided and the bowel segment is transferred up to the neck based on its new blood supply. The objectives of this study were to develop an animal model for prefabricating independently revascularized jejunal segments using the rectus abdominis muscle flap and to determine the minimal time required for independent bowel survival. Twenty-four mature (500-g to 700-g) rats were divided into six experimental groups of four animals each. In each animal, a 1.5-cm segment of proximal jejunum was isolated on two jejunal arteries and wrapped with a superior pedicled rectus abdominis muscle flap. To determine the time of neovascular takeover, the mesenteric pedicles were ligated on postoperative day 2 (group I), day 3 (group II), day 4 (group III), day 5 (group IV), day 6 (group V), and day 7 (group VI). At the time of pedicle ligation, the composite flap was transposed to a new subcutaneous position. Viability of bowel was assessed according to gross appearance and histologic examination 48 hours after transfer. Complete survival of revascularized jejunum in 11 of 12 animals was obtained after pedicle ligation on postoperative day 5 and beyond (p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). These bowel segments demonstrated luminal patency, intact pink mucosa, mucus production, and visible peristalsis. Histologic examination showed healthy intestinal epithelium and tissue integration along the serosa-muscle interphase. In contrast, pedicle ligation on day 4 and earlier resulted in varying degrees of bowel necrosis characterized by flattening or ulceration of mucosa (day 4), mucosal sloughing and necrosis of mural musculature (day 3), and complete loss of bowel architecture with lumen obliteration (day 2).

Necrotic areas in SS tumours were surrounded by capillaries with sharp tips and wrinkled surfaces. Thus, the findings indicated differences in three-dimensional angioarchitecture between vigorously developing tumours and (1) tumours degenerating as the result of treatment with an anti-cancer drug, or (2) necrotic tumour tissues.

The lowest arterial resistance index (RI) and highest peak systolic velocity (PSV) were used for intratumoral blood flow analysis. Individual tumor characteristics evaluated were tumor growth pattern, tumor size, histologic type, tumor grade, myometrial infiltration depth, cervical involvement, lymph node metastasis, and lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI). Tumoral stage and risk for recurrence were also evaluated.\nSignificantly lower RI was found in tumors with the following characteristics: infiltrative growth pattern (P = 0,013), grade 3 (P = 0.001), infiltrating >or=50% of the myometrium (P = 0.006), cervical involvement (P = 0.009), LVSI (P = 0.008), lymph-node metastasis (P = 0.049), stage >or=Ic (P = 0.004), and high risk for recurrence (P = 0.001).

{"title": "Scanning electron microscopic observation of microvasculature in periodontium.", "abstract": "In this study, vascular resin cast models in the periodontium of beagle dogs were prepared and three-dimensional observation of the relationship between the gingiva and periodontal ligament (PDL) vascular network was performed. After the perfusion of Ringer's solution and fixative, synthetic resin was injected from the inferior alveolar arteries. Soft tissue was digested by proteinase solution and specimens were examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The gingival vascular network (GVN) in the region facing the teeth consisted of sulcular and junctional epithelium. The vascular network of the sulcular epithelium (SE) had a renal glomerulus-like form and the junctional epithelium (JE) consisted of squamous mesh. The gingival sulcular fluid exudated from the vascular network directly beneath the JE, and leukocytes permeated from the vascular network beneath the epithelium. Thus, we considered that the GVN performs an important function in the protection against the inflammation. Periodontal ligament had a polygonal mesh vascular network that was anastomosed to the venous plexus of alveolar bone through Volkmann's canals (VC). When occlusal force was applied, the blood in the periodontal vessels flowed out through VC into the bone marrow, and when the force was removed, it flowed backward into the PDL. This blood transfer acted as an absorber against occlusal force. Our findings suggest that the blood vessels of the gingiva perform an important function in defending against inflammation, while the blood vessels of the PDL play a key role in absorbing occlusal force.", "journal": "Microscopy research and technique", "date": "2002-01-26", "authors": ["MasatoMatsuo", "KazutoTakahashi"], "doi": "10.1002/jemt.10008"}

Blockade of this pathway with anti-CD154 antibodies has been reported to prolong allograft survival in experimental transplantation models and to induce tolerance in some instances. However, anti-CD154 monotherapy cannot induce tolerance in \"stringent\" models such as skin and islet transplantation and is not sufficient to prevent chronic graft vasculopathy in vascularized organ transplantation. Therefore, combined therapies of anti-CD154 antibodies plus donor-specific transfusion, bone marrow infusion, or B7 blockade by CTLA4-Ig have been tried, and synergistic effects for tolerance induction have been reported. Furthermore, the efficacy of CD154 blockade in primate models has been confirmed for islet and kidney transplantation. The mechanisms of CD154 blockade in vivo include CTLA4-dependent anergy or regulation, T-cell apoptosis, and induction of regulatory cells. Finally, anti-CD154 antibody therapy has been reported to result in unexpected thromboembolic complications in both primates and humans, although the etiology of these conditions remains unclear.

Intercrosses of these mice with a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic beta cell carcinogenesis (Rip1Tag2) result in an earlier onset of tumor angiogenesis and with it accelerated tumor growth and mortality. The transition from benign tumors (adenoma) to malignant tumors (carcinoma) is modestly accelerated; however, tumor metastases are not observed.

MT1-MMP is critical for pericellular degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor cell invasion and dissemination. To grow efficiently in vivo, tumor cells induce angiogenesis in both primary solid tumors and metastatic foci. The present study describes a functional link between the expression of MT1-MMP and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in human glioma U251 xenografts in athymic mice. To investigate the effects of MT1-MMP on VEGF expression, U251 cells were stably transfected with MT1-MMP to generate the U-MT cell line overexpressing the enzyme. In vitro, the U-MT cells had an increased rate of proliferation and migration as well as the ability to activate the MMP-2 proenzyme and directionally remodel a three-dimensional collagen matrix. These findings suggested higher tumorigenicity of U-MT cells relative to the vector-control U-neo cells. In agreement with the in vitro data, U-MT xenografts in BALB/c nu/nu mice displayed markedly increased growth rates and elevated levels of angiogenesis. In contrast, U-neo cells formed small, minimally vascularized tumors. The elevated angiogenesis in U-MT xenografts was associated with an up-regulation of VEGF expression in tumor cells. In addition, U-MT cells in vitro secreted twice as much VEGF as the control cells. GM6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of MMP activity, down-regulated the production of VEGF in U-MT cells to the levels observed in the U-neo control. Our results demonstrate that the enhanced tumorigenicity of glioma cells overexpressing MT1-MMP involves stimulation of angiogenesis through the up-regulation of VEGF production.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2002-01-26", "authors": ["Elena IDeryugina", "LilianaSoroceanu", "Alex YStrongin"], "doi": null}

To clarify the role of VEGF isoforms in endochondral bone formation, we examined long bone development in mice expressing exclusively the VEGF120 isoform (VEGF120/120 mice). Neonatal VEGF120/120 long bones showed a completely disturbed vascular pattern, concomitant with a 35% decrease in trabecular bone volume, reduced bone growth and a 34% enlargement of the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone of the growth plate. Surprisingly, embryonic hindlimbs at a stage preceding capillary invasion exhibited a delay in bone collar formation and hypertrophic cartilage calcification. Expression levels of marker genes of osteoblast and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation were significantly decreased in VEGF120/120 bones. Furthermore, inhibition of all VEGF isoforms in cultures of embryonic cartilaginous metatarsals, through the administration of a soluble receptor chimeric protein (mFlt-1/Fc), retarded the onset and progression of ossification, suggesting that osteoblast and/or hypertrophic chondrocyte development were impaired. The initial invasion by osteoclasts and endothelial cells into VEGF120/120 bones was retarded, associated with decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9.

{"title": "Low plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 permit increased tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and blocking this process might be a valid tool for the control of cancer growth. We showed previously that tumor angiogenesis in integrin alpha1-null mice is reduced compared to that of wild type animals and that over-expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the alpha1-null and consequent generation of angiostatin (an inhibitor of endothelial cell growth) from circulating plasminogen was implicated in the mechanism of tumor inhibition. Our findings suggested that secretion of excess MMPs generates inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation, including but not necessarily limited to angiostatin, resulting ultimately in auto-inhibition of angiogenesis. Thus MMP inhibitors used as anti-tumor drugs might in fact cause a paradoxical increase in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In order to determine whether MMP-9 expression was directly involved in the regulation of tumor growth, we specifically inhibited or enhanced MMP-9 synthesis in vitro and in vivo, and subsequently analysed primary endothelial cell proliferation and angiostatin synthesis, as well as tumor vascularization and development. We provide evidence that reduction of plasma levels of MMP-9 in either normal or integrin alpha1-null mice leads to decreased synthesis of angiostatin and consequent increased tumor growth and vascularization. In contrast, specifically enhancing MMP-9 expression in vivo caused a reduction in tumor vascularization.

Control and VEGF-modified (VEGF+) CSS were grafted onto full-thickness wounds in athymic mice. VEGF expression was detected in VEGF+ CSS 14 weeks after grafting. Graft contraction was significantly lower in VEGF+ CSS compared with controls, suggesting more stable engraftment and better tissue development. Positive HLA-ABC staining, indicating persistence of human cells, was seen in 86.7% (13/15) of grafted VEGF+ CSS, compared with 58.3% (7/12) of controls. Differences in dermal vascularization between control and VEGF+ grafts were significant 1 week after surgery, but not at later times. However, the distribution of vessels was different, with more vessels in the upper dermis of VEGF+ grafts.

To further test this hypothesis, we stratified our carotid endarterectomy procedures according to current carotid stent protocols.\nWe reviewed our computerized registry and the clinical charts of patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Each procedure was categorized as high risk or low risk, according to the following six separate high-risk factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction; 2, the requirement for combined coronary and carotid vascularization; 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction; 4, contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion; 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy; and 6, anatomically limited access for carotid endarterectomy. Rates of stroke at 30 days, cardiac complications, and death were tabulated.\nBetween January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2000, 415 carotid endarterectomies were performed on 389 patients. Ninety-eight procedures (23.6%) were classified as high risk on the basis of the following factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction (n = 30); 2, requirement for combined coronary and carotid revascularization (n = 14); 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction (n = 8); 4, contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 31); 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (n = 25); and 6, anatomically limited access (n = 4). Seven patients had ipsilateral postoperative strokes (1.7%), with two additional patients having contralateral hemispheric strokes. One patient died from exacerbation of congestive heart failure 9 days after undergoing a second carotid endarterectomy. The total stroke and death rate was 2.6% for all the patients. Two of the 98 procedures in the high-risk group were complicated with ipsilateral stroke (2.0%) as compared with six of the 317 low-risk procedures (1.9%; P = 1). Six procedures were complicated with cardiac dysfunction after surgery, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or the new onset of atrial fibrillation. Three cardiac complications occurred in the low-risk group (1%), and three occurred in the high-risk group (3.1%; P =.15).\nThis series shows that patients at high risk can undergo carotid endarterectomy with stroke rates equivalent to the rates of patients at low risk.

The effects of oltipraz on the development and maturation of a vascular network was determined in vitro using two-dimensional capillary tube formation assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells plated on Matrigel and ex vivo using primary rat aortic ring explant cultures in three-dimensional collagen gels, respectively. The antiangiogenic and antitumor efficacy of oltipraz administration in vivo in nude mice was evaluated by determining its effects on neovascularization in s.c.

A dose-dependent reduction (0.4-100 microM) in microvessel formation was observed in both human and rodent bioassays after oltipraz exposure, with inhibition approaching 100% in the rat aortic ring assay at the highest concentration (P < 0.01). Similarly, oltipraz (40 microM) inhibited complete capillary tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells by 62% (P < 0.05) relative to control cultures. p.o. administration of oltipraz (250 mg/kg/day for 6 days) to nude mice implanted with porcine aortic endothelial cell-Matrigel plugs resulted in a 42% reduction in neovascularization (P < 0.05) relative to vehicle-treated control mice.

This report describes the sequence of histologic events involved in the formation of long bones and their epiphyses in the New Zealand White rabbit.\nPrenatal studies were performed on twelve, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-four, and twenty-seven-day-old rabbit embryos, and postnatal studies were performed on newborn rabbits and on three-to-four-day-old; one, two, four, and six-week-old; and two, three, four, six, and eight-month-old rabbits. Histologic specimens from embryos were embedded in plastic and stained with toluidine blue or safranin O-fast green, and specimens from postnatal rabbits were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or safranin O-fast green.\nStudies of twelve-day-old embryos demonstrated upper and lower limb buds filled with undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, and studies of fourteen-day-old embryos showed mesenchymal condensation and beginning cartilage formation outlining major long bones. Long-bone and epiphyseal development progressed through sixteen structural stages, and the developmental age at which these stages occurred was determined. These stages included limb-bud formation with uniform distribution of mesenchymal cells and formation of an apical ectodermal ridge (stage 1); mesenchymal condensation (stage 2); cartilage differentiation (stage 3); formation of a primary center of ossification (stage 4a); epiphyseal cartilage vascularization with formation of cartilage canals (stage 7); vascular invasion of the developing secondary ossification center (stage 9); bone formation and marrow cavitation in the secondary ossification center with formation of hematopoietic marrow (stage 10); fullest relative extent of secondary-ossification-center development in epiphyseal cartilage (stage 14); thinning of the physis (stage 15); and resorption of the physis with establishment of continuity between epiphyseal and metaphyseal circulations (stage 16).", "journal": "The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The significant association of the MVD with better progression-free survival was recognized only in the patients with clear cell adenocarcinomas. The complete VC group showed a similar trend as MVD though there was no statistical difference. A multivariate analysis revealed MVD to correlate independently with progression-free survival. In ovarian carcinoma, MVD was found to be an independent prognostic factor. In addition, the higher MVD with clear cell adenocarcinoma had the better prognosis.

{"title": "Three-dimensional endoscopic midface enhancement: a personal quest for the ideal cheek rejuvenation.", "abstract": "Standard face-lift techniques are excellent for the treatment of the jawline and neck. Treatment of the area between the lower eyelid and the corner of the mouth required the development of techniques in the intermediate lamella of the face. Alternative techniques of subperiosteal dissection by means of lower eyelid incisions were described with good aesthetic results but at the expense of increased morbidity and complications. All these techniques were also two-dimensional manipulations of the soft tissues of the face. The author presents a different approach that he believes is close to the ideal in terms of safety, morbidity, and complications. Although midface rejuvenation may be performed alone, it is more commonly done as a component of total facial rejuvenation. The midface is approached by means of a combination of a temporal slit incision and an upper oral sulcus incision; no eyelid access is used. Fifty percent of the midface dissection is performed under direct visualization, and 50 percent is performed under endoscopic control. Dissection of the temporal area is done under the temporoparietal fascia down to the zygomatic arch. The anterior two-thirds of the zygomatic arch periosteum is elevated along with a few millimeters of the intermediate temporal fascia and the fascia of the masseter muscle. The subperiosteal dissection of the zygoma and maxilla is completed with the medial extension of the dissection just medial to the infraorbital nerve. The orbital fat pads are released by means of intraoral route, and the lateral and middle fat pads are advanced over the orbital rim and fixed to the masseter tendon and the periosteum of the maxillary shelf at the intraoral incision. Three suspension points are typically used on the midface, each one with a different action. All are anchored to the temporal fascia proper. The vascularized Bichat's fat pad is mobilized and fixed with 4-0 polydioxanone sutures. This provides a volumetric cheek augmentation and improvement of the jowl. The inferior malar periosteum and fascia is used for malar imbrication with 4-0 polydioxanone sutures. This provides an anterior projection of the cheek and elevates the corner of the mouth. The suborbicularis oculi fat is used for en bloc vertical suspension of the cheek. This also improves the infraorbital V deformity. This technique has been used in close to 200 patients over the last 5 years. The complications have been minimal: two cases of temporary paresis of the levator of the upper lip, one case of paresis of the orbicularis oris (unilateral), one case of buccinator muscle dysfunction, and two moderate infections that were treated with simple drainage. The degree of facial edema has been minimal compared with the open or the transblepharoplasty approach. Typically, patients can return to work 2 weeks after surgery.The three-dimensional endoscopic midface enhancement provides a technique of midface remodeling that provides the missing dimension (volume) to the rejuvenation of the midface. This can be done with a minimal rate of complications, and the aesthetic results surpass by far the results of other midface techniques previously described by the author.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-01-12", "authors": ["Oscar MRamirez"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200201000-00052"}

In a rat model, a periosteal flap vascularized by the saphenous artery and vein was dissected off the medial surface of the tibia. This flap consisted of three layers-periosteum, muscle, and fascia-and was tubed on itself to form a watertight chamber that was then transferred on its vascular pedicle to the groin. A total of 78 vascularized periosteal chambers were constructed in 39 animals and divided into 10 groups. In group 1, the periosteal chamber was left empty. Groups 2, 3, and 4 consisted of the periosteal flap and rhBMP-2, but in group 3, the proximal vascular pedicle was ligated, and in group 4, the flap was harvested without the periosteal layer and turned inside out. Groups 5 through 10 consisted of the vascularized periosteal flap containing several different structural matrices (calcium alginate spheres, polylactic acid, or demineralized bone matrix) with or without rhBMP-2. Animals were killed at 2, 4, or 8 weeks in each group. The presence and density of any new bone formation was evaluated both radiologically and histologically. Significant bone formation was seen only in those periosteal flaps containing rhBMP-2 and either the calcium alginate or polylactic acid matrix. New bone formation increased both radiologically and histologically from 2 weeks to 8 weeks only in the periosteal flaps containing the polylactic acid matrix and rhBMP-2. This preliminary study therefore suggests that four factors-blood supply, osteoprogenitor cells in the periosteal layer, a biodegradable matrix, and rhBMP-2-are required for optimal prefabrication of a vascularized bone graft.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2002-01-12", "authors": ["EV\u00f6gelin M D", "N FJones", "J RLieberman", "J MBaker", "A STsingotjidou", "J HBrekke"], "doi": "10.1097/00006534-200201000-00029"}
{"title": "Combined anterolateral thigh flap and vascularized fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap in reconstruction of extensive composite mandibular defects.", "abstract": "Extensive composite defects of the oromandibular area are usually created after the surgical treatment of T3 and T4 cancers, requiring complex reconstructive plastic surgical procedures. The preferred treatment method for this type of defect is reconstruction with two free flaps. The use of the vascularized fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap for the bone and inner lining defect is well known and accepted. Among the flaps that can be used for the outer lining and soft-tissue reconstruction, the two most commonly used have been the forearm flap and the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. However, these flaps have some disadvantages that restrict their use for this purpose. The forearm flap is usually too thin to cover the fibular bone and reconstruction plate, and the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap can cause a subclinical reduction in abdominal strength. Both radial forearm and rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps are difficult to harvest during tumor excision. Because of these drawbacks, over the past several years the authors have preferred to use the anterolateral thigh flap for outer face, neck, and submandibular region reconstructions. From October of 1998 to June of 2000, 22 extensive composite mandibular defect reconstructions using the free anterolateral thigh flap, combined with the vascularized free fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap, were performed at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Complete flap survival was 90.9 percent (40 of 44 flaps). Complete loss was seen in an anterolateral thigh flap, which was then reconstructed with a pectoralis major myocutaneous pedicled flap (2.3 percent). There were five venous problems: three in osteoseptocutaneous free fibula flaps, the other two in anterolateral thigh flaps; all were revised immediately. However, the skin islands of two osteoseptocutaneous free fibula flaps and one anterolateral thigh flap developed partial necrosis (6.8 percent). The other complications were compartment syndrome in the leg in one patient, external carotid artery rupture in one patient, three donor-site infections in two patients, three neck wound infections, and one myocardial insufficiency; all were treated properly. Thirteen patients underwent revision procedures 6 months after the first operation. These procedures included debulking of the flap or revision of the mouth angle or both. Trismus or intraoral contraction was noted in none of these patients.

The present study investigated the effect of 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHC) on vascularized renal allografts in rats.\nThree days prior to transplantation, two groups of animals were subjected to 1,25DHC (1 microg/kg/day IP) and a low calcium diet, which was continued until the end of the experiments. Recipient organs were removed and single allografts were transplanted in a high responder strain combination (ACI --> Lewis). Following transplantation, low-dose cyclosporine A (3.2 mg/kg/day CsA) administration was started in two experimental groups of recipients (one group receiving 1,25 DHC additionally) whereas the control allograft recipients received no immunosuppression (control III). Graft survival and renal function was monitored until death or the end of experiments and allograft rejection was assessed histologically using the Banff classification.\n1,25DHC significantly prolonged allograft survival in comparison to control III (9.6 +/- 1 vs. 5.7 +/- 0.2 days; P=0.009). In addition, a combination of 1,25DHC and low-dose CsA increased allograft survival compared to CsA administration alone (24 +/- 0.9 vs. 13 +/- 0.3 days; P=0.008). 1,25DHC preserved renal creatinine clearance and decreased proteinuria in comparison to control III, and the combination of 1,25DHC and low-dose CsA again showed an additive effect on preservation of renal function. 1,25DHC and low-dose CsA both decreased interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12 expression levels in serum and allografts, and a combination treatment produced the strongest attenuation of IL-2 and IL-12 expression. In addition, 1,25DHC increased IL-4 and IL-10 expression levels in allografts, whereas CsA alone did not alter IL-4 and IL-10 expression. In contrast, combination of 1,25DHC and low-dose CsA showed a significant increase in IL-10 expression levels whereas IL-4 expression was not elevated.\nMonotherapy with 1,25DHC significantly prolongs survival of renal allografts and preserves graft function in rats.

{"title": "Wound healing: the role of gap junctional communication in rat granulation tissue maturation.", "abstract": "Granulation tissue maturation is dependent upon the orientation of collagen fibers and cell differentiation. Gap junctions are intercellular membrane gated channels that facilitate direct communication between cells known as gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). The hypothesis is that GJIC modulates the maturation of granulation tissue during wound repair. In vitro, GJIC optimizes fibroblast-populated collagen lattice contraction and influences cell morphology. It is reported that LiCl increases GJIC in cultured cardiac myocytes. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponge implants with central reservoirs were placed within separate subcutaneous pockets on the backs of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Each PVA implant received either 20 mM LiCl or saline injections on days 5, 7, and 10 after implantation. On day 11 implants were harvested and processed for light microscopy. By H&E staining LiCl-treated implants showed increased vascularization and decreased cell density compared to saline controls. Polarized light microscopy of Sirius red-stained specimens revealed more intense collagen fiber birefringence secondary to dense, parallel-organized collagen fiber bundles after LiCl treatment. This suggests that LiCl enhancement of GJIC between fibroblasts advances the maturation of granulation tissue. It is proposed that the degree of GJIC between granulation tissue fibroblasts influences both the quantity and the quality of granulation tissue deposited during the wound healing process.", "journal": "Experimental and molecular pathology", "date": "2002-01-11", "authors": ["K EMoyer", "ADavis", "G CSaggers", "D RMackay", "H PEhrlich"], "doi": "10.1006/exmp.2001.2406"}

For that reason, the aim of this study was to examine quantitative vascularization pattern between free vascular grafts and the pre-irradiated graft bed as a function of the preoperative irradiation dose.\nA total of 217 free microvascular hard and soft tissue grafts were used within 199 patients in the head and neck region to cover defects after ablative tumor surgery. Seventy-six patients (group 1) had no prior radiation (RT), 50 patients (group 2) were treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy using 40 to 50 Gy and 5-FU/cisplatin, and 73 patients (group 3) had prior RT (60-70 Gy) between 1 and 7 years before surgery. After healing of the grafts, samples were taken from 42 patients from the graft, the irradiated graft bed, and the transition area between graft and irradiated graft bed. Samples were analyzed as follows: capillary sprouting, structural changes, and distribution patterns were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining (CD34 labeling of capillary endothelium). Three histological sections (2-4 microm) per sample were examined histomorphometrically (ratio capillary area/total area, capillary lumen, and the number of capillaries) by (National Institute of Health) NIH-image-digitized measurements. A statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test (two-tailed p <.05).\nThe success rate of vascular grafts in group 1 (0 Gy) was 94%, in group 2 (40-50 Gy/5-FU/cisplatin) 90%, in group 3 (60-70 Gy) 84%. In contrast to groups 1 and 2, group 3 showed qualitatively reduced and more irregular capillary distribution with more marked pericapillary fibrosis in the irradiated tissue.

To ensure the safety and effectiveness of this technique, the soft and hard tissue response to photocrosslinked PPF scaffolds of different pore morphologies was investigated. Four classes of photocrosslinked PPF scaffolds, constructed with differing porosities (57-75%) and pore sizes (300-500 or 600-800 microm), were implanted both subcutaneously and in 6.3-mm-diameter cranial defects in a rabbit model. The rabbits were sacrificed at 2 and 8 weeks, and the implants were analyzed by light microscopy, histological scoring analysis, and histomorphometric analysis. Results showed the PPF scaffolds elicit a mild tissue response in both soft and hard tissues. Inflammatory cells, vascularization, and connective tissue were observed at 2 weeks; a decrease in inflammatory cell density and a more organized connective tissue were observed at 8 weeks. Scaffold porosity and scaffold pore size were not found to significantly affect the observed tissue response. Evidence of scaffold surface degradation was noted both by histology and histomorphometric analysis. Bone ingrowth in PPF scaffolds implanted into cranial defects was <3% of the defect area.

{"title": "Transforming growth factor-beta and Ras regulate the VEGF/VEGF-receptor system during tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The formation of new microvasculature by capillary sprouting, or angiogenesis, is a prerequisite for solid tumor growth. The genetic alterations required to activate the angiogenic program in tumor angiogenesis are still only vaguely known, but dominantly acting oncoproteins may have a much greater impact than previously realized. Here we have studied the consequences of oncogenic transformation on tumor angiogenesis in a mouse mammary carcinoma model. We provide evidence that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and of the VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1), a signaling system centrally involved in tumor angiogenesis, occurs efficiently in tumors formed by Ras-transformed mammary epithelial cells and that both TGF-beta1 and hypoxia are potent inducers of VEGF expression in these cells. VEGF induction in the tumor periphery is mainly triggered by TGF-beta1, whereas VEGF expression in perinecrotic areas is regulated by both hypoxia and TGF-beta1. As the Ras-transformed tumor cells convert into migrating, fibroblastoid cells that start to produce TGF-beta during tumor progression, the TGF-beta effect on VEGF expression becomes propagated throughout the tumor tissue. Thus, in progressed tumors, areas of TGF-beta1 activation and hypoxia may overlap and hence cooperate to induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis. Nevertheless, the overexpression of VEGF in non-Ras-transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells was not sufficient to promote vascularization in vivo. Based on these findings, we conclude that amongst the multiple mutations that render a normal cell tumorigenic, oncogenic Ras is a major player that in conjunction with the tumor's micro-environment sets the stage for tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2002-01-05", "authors": ["GeorgBreier", "SabineBlum", "JanosPeli", "MarcelGroot", "CarolaWild", "WernerRisau", "ErnstReichmann"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.1599"}

The high proliferation rate in the tumor deprived of proper vascularization would be balanced by cell death due to lack of diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic growth factors, and their receptors are the main targets of an increasing number of clinical trials approved to test the tolerance and therapeutic efficacy of antiangiogenic agents. We observed that a series of substances proposed as possible cancer chemopreventive agents show antiangiogenic properties when tested in in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis models. We demonstrated that N-acetyl-l-cysteine is able to reduce the invasive and metastatic potential of melanoma cells, and to inhibit endothelial cell invasion by direct inhibition of MMP activity. We also showed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a flavonoid from green tea that possesses chemopreventive activity in experimental and epidemiological studies, is a potent inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Angiogenesis has also been demonstrated to be a target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug chemopreventive activity. Based on these data, we hypothesize that other chemopreventive agents, including natural or synthetic retinoids, steroid hormone antagonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands, vitamin D, and protease inhibitors, might have antiangiogenesis as an important mechanism of action, a novel concept we will term 'angioprevention'.

In rats in which s.c. gliomas were grown for a total of 29 days, systemic treatment with recombinant murine endostatin induced about 50% reduction of intratumoral blood flow and tumor size after only 10 days of therapy. In contrast, the blood flow to irrelevant organs was unaffected by endostatin, indicating its specificity of action. Tumors were not observed to increase in size or regrow after cessation of therapy. Furthermore, endostatin-treated rats with i.c. tumors had significantly longer survival time than did untreated controls. In the treated rats, endostatin therapy resulted in a reduced tumor blood vessel volume and an increased tumor cell density with an increased apoptotic index within a given tumor volume, as verified by flow cytometry and by staining with deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling.

We present a description of the technology, its fundamental effect on tissue, selected preclinical results, and early clinical outcomes in a variety of surgical disciplines. The initial product that incorporates this technology is the TissueLink Floating Ball\u2122, a monopolar surface coagulator, available in both laparoscopic and open shaft lengths. The low flow rate of saline couples RF to tissue and provides Cooling to limit the tissue temperature to no greater than 100\u00b0C. This prevents desiccation, eschar, smoke, and sticking associated with conventional dry electrosurgical devices with dry electrodes. The primary tissue effect OCcurs at tissue temperatures in the range of 60-80\u00b0C and involves the shrinkage of the Type I collagen that OCcurs in the walls of blood vessels, airways, bile ducts and other biological vessels. The shrinkage of the collagen closes the lumen and seals the vessel. Data is presented on the depth of the tissue effect and the chronic healing response in porcine liver. Early clinical results in the form of case reports are presented for both general and thoracic surgical applications, particularly for highly vascularized parenchymatous organs such as liver and lung. The use of the TissueLink device for liver resections has shown the potential to dramatically reduce blood loss. Its use in thoracic surgery has demonstrated it is capable of achieving both hemostasis and aerostasis.", "journal": "Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy", "date": "2002-01-01", "authors": ["MPearson", "MMcCIurken", "RThompson"], "doi": "10.1080/13645706.2003.11873724"}

One novel solution to this shortage envisions 'growing' new kidneys in situ via xenotransplantation of renal primordia. To be successful, such an approach would require the following criteria to be met: that transplants are 'grown' in a location that renders their subsequent excretory function possible; that developed transplants have normal morphology and function; that transplanted metanephroi become well integrated into the host, in terms of inducing a state of immune tolerance and being vascularized by host vessels; and that source material for metanephros transplants is easy to access.

{"title": "Prolonged allograft survival in TNF receptor 1-deficient recipients is due to immunoregulatory effects, not to inhibition of direct antigraft cytotoxicity.", "abstract": "TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin (LT)alpha have been shown to be important mediators of allograft rejection. TNF-R1 is the principal receptor for both molecules. Mice with targeted genetic deletions of TNF-R1 demonstrate normal development of T and B lymphocytes but exhibit functional defects in immune responses. However, the role of TNF-R1-mediated signaling in solid organ transplant rejection has not been defined. To investigate this question, we performed vascularized heterotopic allogeneic cardiac transplants in TNF-R1-deficient (TNF-R1(-/-)) and wild-type mice. Because all allografts in our protocol expressed TNF-R1, direct antigraft effects of TNF-alpha and LTalpha were not prevented. However, immunoregulatory effects on recipient inflammatory cells by TNF-R1 engagement was eliminated in TNF-R1(-/-) recipients. In our study, cardiac allograft survival was significantly prolonged in TNF-R1(-/-) recipients. Despite this prolonged allograft survival, we detected increased levels of CD8 T cell markers in allografts from TNF-R1(-/-) recipients, suggesting that effector functions, but not T cell recruitment, were blocked. We also demonstrated the inhibition of multiple chemokines and cytokines in allografts from TNF-R1(-/-) recipients including RANTES, IFN-inducible protein-10, lymphotactin, and IL-1R antagonist, as well as altered levels of chemokine receptors. We correlated gene expression with the physiologic process of allograft rejection using self-organizing maps and identified distinct patterns of gene expression in allografts from TNF-R1(-/-) recipients. These findings indicate that in our experimental system TNF-alpha and LTalpha exert profound immunoregulatory effects through TNF-R1.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["Charlotte MMcKee", "RachelDefina", "HongzhenHe", "Kathleen JHaley", "James RStone", "David LPerkins"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.168.1.483"}
{"title": "Immature and mature CD8alpha+ dendritic cells prolong the survival of vascularized heart allografts.", "abstract": "CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- dendritic cells (DCs) arise from committed bone marrow progenitors and can induce or regulate immune reactivity. Previously, the maturational status of CD8alpha-(myeloid) DCs has been shown to influence allogeneic T cell responses and allograft survival. Although CD8alpha+ DCs have been implicated in central tolerance and found to modulate peripheral T cell function, their influence on the outcome of organ transplantation has not been examined. Consistent with their equivalent high surface expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, sorted mature C57BL/10J (B10; H2(b)) DCs of either subset primed naive, allogeneic C3H/HeJ (C3H; H2(k)) recipients for Th1 responses. Paradoxically and in contrast to their CD8alpha- counterparts, mature CD8alpha+ B10 DCs given systemically 7 days before transplant markedly prolonged B10 heart graft survival in C3H recipients. This effect was associated with specific impairment of ex vivo antidonor T cell proliferative responses, which was not reversed by exogenous IL-2. Further analyses of possible underlying mechanisms indicated that neither immune deviation nor induction of regulatory cells was a significant contributory factor. In contrast to the differential capacity of the mature DC subsets to affect graft outcome, immature CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- DCs administered under the same experimental conditions significantly prolonged transplant survival. These observations demonstrate for the first time the innate capacity of CD8alpha+ DCs to regulate alloimmune reactivity and transplant survival, independent of their maturation status. Mobilization of such a donor DC subset with capacity to modulate antidonor immunity may have significant implications for the therapy of allograft rejection.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["Peta JO'Connell", "WeiLi", "ZhiliangWang", "Susan MSpecht", "Alison JLogar", "Angus WThomson"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.168.1.143"}
{"title": "Intraluteal release of angiotensin II and progesterone in vivo during corpora lutea development in the cow: effect of vasoactive peptides.", "abstract": "The newly formed corpus luteum (CL) develops rapidly and has the features of active vascularization and mitosis of steroidogenic cells. Such local mechanisms must be strictly regulated by the complex relationship between angiogenic growth factors and vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin (Ang) II, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and endothelin (ET)-1. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine 1) the changes in vasoactive peptides and progesterone (P) concentrations within the developing CL, along with the changes in concentration in ovarian venous plasma (OVP) and jugular venous plasma (JVP) in the cow, 2) the effects of CL exposure to vasoactive peptides on Ang II and P secretion, and 3) the expression of mRNA for ANP type C receptor in the bovine CL and endothelial cells (ETC) from bovine developing CL. A microdialysis system (MDS) was surgically implanted into multiple CL of six cows on Day 3 after a GnRH injection that induced superovulation, and a catheter was simultaneously inserted into the ovarian vein. The Ang II concentration in OVP was higher than that in JVP throughout the experiment, while the intraluteal release of Ang II was stable. During the experimental period, the concentrations of other vasoactive peptides (ANP and ET-1) showed no clear changes in plasma and were below detectable levels in the MDS perfusate. Exposure of CL to Ang II using the MDS stimulated P release, while exposure to ANP enhanced Ang II release within the developing CL. However, ET-1 had no effect on either P or Ang II release. The expression of mRNA for ANP type C receptor was mainly observed in early CL and ETC. The results suggest that the ET-Ang-ANP system in the preovulatory follicle switches to an Ang-ANP system to enhance both the angiogenesis and steroidogenesis that are actively occurring in developing CL.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["Shu-ichiKobayashi", "Tomas JAcosta", "TakahiroOzawa", "KanakoHayashi", "BajramBerisha", "MasayukiOhtani", "DieterSchams", "AkioMiyamoto"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod66.1.174"}
{"title": "Differential response to Tat and FGF-2 of two novel clonal populations derived from murine Kaposi-like lesions developing in Tat transgenic mice.", "abstract": "Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a highly vascularized multifocal tumor frequent and aggressive in HIV-infected individuals, is initiated and maintained by the concomitant action of HIV-1 Tat, cytokines, and growth factors. Spindle cells, the proliferative component of KS lesions, were isolated from Kaposi-like lesions developing in Tat transgenic mice and cloned. Here we describe the behavior of two of the clones obtained: cells from clone 1 showed the classical endothelial phenotype and were therefore named murine endothelial cells (MEC), while cells from clone 2 had a typical spindle shape, coexpressed markers of endothelial, smooth muscle, and macrophage lineage; and were named spindle cells (SC). Tat stimulated MEC growth and migration, but not uPA production, suggesting that Tat cannot activate a complete angiogenic program in these cells, unless FGF-2 is present. Tat stimulated SC growth only when the cells were cultured at low density and this correlated with the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of various substrates, among which was erk-2, which mediates mitogenic signaling. The inhibition of SC growth in high cell density culture by Tat could be circumvented by the addition of FGF-2. We conclude that (i) the response of SC to Tat is density dependent and (ii) the angiogenic effect of Tat on both MEC and SC requires the presence of FGF-2.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2001-12-26", "authors": ["ZhihaoWu", "MassimoMariotti", "UgoCavallaro", "Marco RSoria", "Jeanette A MMaier"], "doi": "10.1006/mvre.2001.2361"}
{"title": "Bioactive sol-gel foams for tissue repair.", "abstract": "Bioactive glasses are known to have the ability to regenerate bone, but their use has been restricted mainly to powder, granules, or small monoliths. This work reports on the development of sol-gel foams with potential applications as bone graft implants or as templates for the in vitro synthesis of bone tissue for transplantation. These bioactive foams exhibit a hierarchical structure with interconnected macropores (10-500 microm) and a mesoporous framework typical of gel-glasses (pores of 2-50 nm). The macroporous matrixes were produced through a novel route that comprises foaming of sol-gel systems. Three glass systems were tested to verify the applicability of this manufacturing route, namely SiO(2), SiO(2)-CaO, and SiO(2)-CaO-P(2)O(5). This new class of material combines large pores to support vascularization and 3-D tissue growth with the ability that bioactive materials have to provide bone-bonding and controlled release of ionic biologic stimuli to promote bone cell proliferation by gene activation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research", "date": "2001-12-18", "authors": ["PilarSepulveda", "Julian RJones", "Larry LHench"], "doi": "10.1002/jbm.1250"}
{"title": "Vascularization in the primate visual cortex during development.", "abstract": "We studied the relationship between vascularization and neuronal activity in the visual cortex during postnatal development in the primate. Analyses were focused on layer IVC that displays a sequential pattern of maturation for the magno- and parvocellular systems in separate sublayers, respectively IVC alpha and IVC beta. Cytochrome oxidase and endogenous alkaline phosphatase histochemistry was used to analyse, on the same sections, the laminar patterns of cortical activity and vessel density in the primary visual cortex of the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Experiments were carried out in five young and two adult animals. We showed that the temporal pattern of angiogenesis differs in layer IVC alpha and IVC beta. During the first postnatal month, vessel density is higher in IVC alpha than in IVC beta and runs parallel to cytochrome oxidase intensity. In 2-month-old animals, both vessel densities and cytochrome oxidase activity are similar in IVC alpha and IVC beta. In adults, the vessel densities in IVC alpha and IVC beta are the reverse of those observed during the first postnatal month. Vessel diameter does not account for this evolution in vascular patterns. In the discussion, we suggest that such a developmental time-course of angiogenesis might be linked to the synaptogenesis requirements that proceed differently for the magno- and parvocellular systems in the primate striate cortex.", "journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "date": "2001-12-12", "authors": ["CarolineFonta", "MichelImbert"], "doi": "10.1093/cercor/12.2.199"}
