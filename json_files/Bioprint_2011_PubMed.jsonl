{"title": "Effect of needle geometry on flow rate and cell damage in the dispensing-based biofabrication process.", "abstract": "Biodispensing techniques have been widely applied in biofabrication processes to deliver cell suspensions and biomaterials to create cell-seeded constructs. Under identical operating conditions,two types of dispensing needles\u2014tapered and cylindrical\u2014can result in different flow rates of material and different cell damage percent induced by the mechanical forces. In this work, mathematical models of both flow rate and cell damage percent in biodispensing systems using tapered and cylindrical needles, respectively, were developed, and experiments were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the developed models. Both simulations and experiments show tapered needles produce much higher flow rates under the same pressure conditions than cylindrical needles. Use of a lower pressure in a tapered needle can therefore achieve the same flow rate as that in a cylindrical needle. At equivalent flow rates, cell damage in a tapered needle is lower than that in a cylindrical one. Both Schwann cells and 3T3 fibroblasts, which have been widely used in tissue engineering, were used to validate the cell damage models. Application of the developed models to specify the influence of process parameters, including needle geometry and air pressure, on the flow rate and cell damage percent represents a significant advance for biofabrication processes.The models can be used to optimize process parameters to preserve cell viability and achieve the desired cell distribution in dispensing-based biofabrication.", "journal": "Biotechnology progress", "date": "2012-01-13", "authors": ["MingganLi", "XiaoyuTian", "David JSchreyer", "XiongbiaoChen"], "doi": "10.1002/btpr.679"}
{"title": "Planar and three-dimensional printing of conductive inks.", "abstract": "Printed electronics rely on low-cost, large-area fabrication routes to create flexible or multidimensional electronic, optoelectronic, and biomedical devices. In this paper, we focus on one- (1D), two- (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) printing of conductive metallic inks in the form of flexible, stretchable, and spanning microelectrodes. Direct-write assembly is a 1-to-3D printing technique that enables the fabrication of features ranging from simple lines to complex structures by the deposition of concentrated inks through fine nozzles (~0.1 - 250 \u03bcm). This printing method consists of a computer-controlled 3-axis translation stage, an ink reservoir and nozzle, and 10x telescopic lens for visualization. Unlike inkjet printing, a droplet-based process, direct-write assembly involves the extrusion of ink filaments either in- or out-of-plane. The printed filaments typically conform to the nozzle size. Hence, microscale features (< 1 \u03bcm) can be patterned and assembled into larger arrays and multidimensional architectures. In this paper, we first synthesize a highly concentrated silver nanoparticle ink for planar and 3D printing via direct-write assembly. Next, a standard protocol for printing microelectrodes in multidimensional motifs is demonstrated. Finally, applications of printed microelectrodes for electrically small antennas, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes are highlighted.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2012-01-05", "authors": ["Bok YeopAhn", "Steven BWalker", "Scott CSlimmer", "AnalisaRusso", "AshleyGupta", "SteveKranz", "Eric BDuoss", "Thomas FMalkowski", "Jennifer ALewis"], "doi": "10.3791/3189"}

Here we demonstrate a bio-enabled self-assembly technique for fabrication of multi-layered protein and nanometallic assemblies utilizing a modular gold-binding (AuBP1) fusion tag. To accomplish the bottom-up assembly we first genetically fused the AuBP1 peptide sequence to the C'-terminus of maltose-binding protein (MBP) using two different linkers to produce MBP-AuBP1 hetero-functional constructs. Using various spectroscopic techniques, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), we verified the exceptional binding and self-assembly characteristics of AuBP1 peptide. The AuBP1 peptide tag can direct the organization of recombinant MBP protein on various gold surfaces through an efficient control of the organic-inorganic interface at the molecular level. Furthermore using a combination of soft-lithography, self-assembly techniques and advanced AuBP1 peptide tag technology, we produced spatially and hierarchically controlled protein multi-layered assemblies on gold nanoparticle arrays with high molecular packing density and pattering efficiency in simple, reproducible steps.

The latest progress in cell-based biohybrid actuators has been limited to rigid materials, such as silicon and PDMS, ranging in elastic moduli on the order of mega (10(6)) to giga (10(9)) Pascals. Recent reports in the literature have established a correlation between substrate rigidity and its influence on the contractile behavior of cardiomyocytes (A. J. Engler, C. Carag-Krieger, C. P.

This study explores the fabrication of a more compliant cantilever, similar to that of the native myocardium, with elasticity on the order of kilo (10(3)) Pascals. 3D stereolithographic technology, a layer-by-layer UV polymerizable rapid prototyping system, was used to rapidly fabricate multi-material cantilevers composed of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and acrylic-PEG-collagen (PC) mixtures. The incorporation of acrylic-PEG-collagen into PEGDA-based materials enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and organization without altering the ability to vary the elastic modulus through the molecular weight of PEGDA. Cardiomyocytes derived from neonatal rats were seeded on the cantilevers, and the resulting stresses and contractile forces were calculated using finite element simulations validated with classical beam equations.

One of the main issues regarding the application of CATE concerns the definition of the internal architecture of the fabricated scaffolds, which, in turn, influences their porosity and mechanical strength. The present study envisages an innovative strategy for the fabrication of highly optimized structures, based on the a priori finite element analysis (FEA) of the physiological load set at the implant site. The resulting scaffold micro-architecture does not follow a regular geometrical pattern; on the contrary, it is based on the results of a numerical study. The algorithm was applied to a solid free-form fabrication process, using poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) as the starting material for the processing of additive manufactured structures. A simple and intuitive geometry was chosen as a proof-of-principle application, on which finite element simulations and mechanical testing were performed. Then, to demonstrate the capability in creating mechanically biomimetic structures, the proximal femur subjected to physiological loading conditions was considered and a construct fitting a femur head portion was designed and manufactured.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2011-11-24", "authors": ["AlbertoRainer", "Sara MGiannitelli", "DinoAccoto", "StefanoDe Porcellinis", "EugenioGuglielmelli", "MarcellaTrombetta"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-011-0465-4"}

It utilizes computer-controlled 3-D printer mechanism or solid free-form fabrication technologies. In this study, sodium alginate hydrogel that can be utilized for large-dimension tissue fabrication with its fast gelation property was studied regarding material-specific printing technique and printing parameters using a multinozzle bioprinting system developed by the authors. A sodium alginate solution was prepared with a concentration of 1% (wt/vol), and 1% CaCl(2) solution was used as cross-linker for the gelation. The two materials were loaded in each of two nozzles in the multinozzle bioprinting system that has a total of four nozzles of which the injection speed can be independently controlled. A 3-D alginate structure was fabricated through layer-by-layer printing. Each layer was formed through two phases of printing, the first phase with the sodium alginate solution and the second phase with the calcium chloride solution, in identical printing pattern and speed condition. The target patterns were lattice shaped with 2-mm spacing and two different line widths. The nozzle moving speed was 6.67 mm/s, and the injection head speed was 10 \u00b5m/s. For the two different line widths, two injection needles with inner diameters of 260 and 410 \u00b5m were used. The number of layers accumulated was five in this experiment. By varying the nozzle moving speed and the injection speed, various pattern widths could be achieved.

{"title": "Vertical bone augmentation with 3D-synthetic monetite blocks in the rabbit calvaria.", "abstract": "Long-term success of osteointegrated dental implants requires sufficient volume of healthy bone at the recipient sites. However, this is frequently lacking as a result of trauma, tooth loss, or infection. Onlay autografting is amongst the most predictable techniques for craniofacial vertical bone augmentation, however, complications related to donor site morbidity are common and alternatives to onlay autografts are desirable.\nTo develop and evaluate a new synthetic onlay block for vertical bone augmentation.\nSixteen synthetic monetite monolithic discs-shaped blocks were prepared using a 3D-printing technique. The blocks were computer-designed, and had a diameter of 9.0\u00a0mm, a thickness of either 4.0\u00a0mm (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or 3.0\u00a0mm (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and one 0.5-mm wide central hole that enabled their surgical fixation with osteosynthesis screws. The blocks were randomly allocated to each side of the calvaria (right or left) of eight New Zealand rabbits and fixed with screws to achieve vertical bone augmentation. Eight weeks after the surgical intervention, the animals were sacrificed and the calvaria were retrieved for histological analysis. The following parameters were analysed: the interaction between the graft and the original bone surface, the amount of bone ingrowth within the graft and the gain in bone height achieved by the procedure. Wilcoxon t-test was used to evaluate significant differences between the two types of monetite bone block grafts.\nThe blocks were easy to handle and no damage or fracture was registered while being screw-fixated to the calvarial bone. As a result, the surgical procedure was easy and quick. After a healing of 8\u00a0weeks, the synthetic blocks were strongly fused to the calvarial bone surface. Upon histological observation, the monetite blocks appeared to be infiltrated by newly formed bone, without histological signs of necrosis, osteolysis or foreign body reaction. Histomorphometry revealed that bone augmentation occurred within and over the monetite block. The 4.0- and 3.0-mm high blocks were filled with newly formed bone with 35% and 41% of their respective volumes. These observations indicated that craniofacial bone augmentations of at least 4\u00a0mm could be achieved with synthetic monetite blocks.\nWithin the limits of our study, this novel material may be able to eliminate the need for autologous bone transplantation for the augmentation of large vertical bone defects.", "journal": "Journal of clinical periodontology", "date": "2011-11-19", "authors": ["Jes\u00fasTorres", "FalehTamimi", "Mohammad HamdanAlkhraisat", "Juan CarlosPrados-Frutos", "EmadRastikerdar", "UweGbureck", "Jake EBarralet", "EnriqueL\u00f3pez-Cabarcos"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-051X.2011.01787.x"}

The edited CAD-model was used for creating a physical plaster model of the true lumen in a 3D-printer. Elastic and transparent silicon was applied onto the plaster model, which was then removed leaving a silicon replica of the aorta.\nThe median (interquartile range) difference between diameters obtained from CTA- and RP plaster-model at 19 predefined locations was 0.5 mm (1 mm) which corresponds to a relative median difference of 4.6% (7.0%). The average wall thickness of the silicone model was 3.5 mm. The elasticity property and performance during intervention was good with an acceptable transparency.\nThe integration of RP-techniques with CAD based reconstruction of 3D-medical imaging data provides the needed tools for making a truly patient specific replica of the whole aorta with high accuracy.

The results showed that surfaces coated with cl-albumin film are highly resistant to protein adsorption, regardless of protein charge and rigidity. In addition, this adsorption-resistance property can be easily converted to promote protein adsorption by exposing the cl-albumin film to a charged polymer solution. By combining the convertible surface property of cl-albumin film and inkjet printing techniques, a precise protein micropattern was successfully fabricated on the substrate.

{"title": "The development of silk fibroin scaffolds using an indirect rapid prototyping approach: morphological analysis and cell growth monitoring by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "To date, naturally derived biomaterials are rarely used in advanced tissue engineering (TE) methods despite their superior biocompatibility. This is because these native materials, which consist mainly of proteins and polysaccharides, do not possess the ability to withstand harsh processing conditions. Unlike synthetic polymers, natural materials degrade and decompose rapidly in the presence of chemical solvents and high temperature, respectively. Thus, the fabrication of tissue scaffolds using natural biomaterials is often carried out using conventional techniques, where the efficiency in mass transport of nutrients and removal of waste products within the construct is compromised. The present study identified silk fibroin (SF) protein as a suitable material for the application of rapid prototyping (RP) or additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Using the indirect RP method, via the use of a mould, SF tissue scaffolds with both macro- and micro-morphological features can be produced and qualitatively examined by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

Neovasculatures prepatterned into parallel arrays formed functional networks after 4 weeks postimplantation but lost the prepatterned architecture. However, maintenance of uniaxial physical constraints during postangiogenesis remodeling of the implanted neovasculatures produced networks with aligned microvessels, as well as an altered proportional distribution of arterioles, capillaries, and venules.\nHere we show that network topology resulting from implanted microvessel precursors is independent from prepatterning of precursors but can be influenced by a patterning stimulus involving tissue deformation during postangiogenesis remodeling and maturation.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2011-11-05", "authors": ["Carlos CChang", "LaxminarayananKrishnan", "Sara SNunes", "Kenneth HChurch", "Lowell TEdgar", "Eugene DBoland", "Jeffery AWeiss", "Stuart KWilliams", "James BHoying"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.238725"}

In this paper, we present a new approach to scaffold fabrication by combining the solid-state foaming and the immiscible polymer-blending method. The proposed approach has the advantage of being versatile and able to create a wide range of pore size and porosity. The proposed method is studied with polylactic acid (PLA) and polystyrene (PS) blends. The interconnected porous structure was created by first foaming the PLA/PS blend and then extracting the PS phase. The solid-state foaming experiments were conducted under various conditions to achieve the desired pore sizes. It is shown that the PS phase of the PLA/PS blend can be extracted much faster in the foamed samples and the pore size of the scaffolds can be easily controlled with proper gas foaming parameters. The average pore size achieved in the foaming process ranged from 20 to 70 \u00b5m. After PS extraction, both pore size and porosity can be further improved. For example, the pore size and porosity increased from 48 \u00b5m and 49% to 59 \u00b5m and 67%, respectively, after the PS extraction process.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the tridimensional organization of cells and biomaterials on cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The experimental LAB setup was comprised of an infrared laser, focused onto a glass ribbon coated with an absorbing layer of gold. The cell bioink was made of MG63 cells (50 millions cells/mL in culture medium and 1% alginate), transduced with Luciferase gene for tracking and quantification. The printing substrate was a 100-\u03bcm-thick polycaprolacton (PCL) electrospun scaffold. The building sequence comprised sequential layers of cells and PCL scaffolds stacked using two different tridimensional arrangements, which were compared in this study (layer-by-layer vs. seeding on a single locus of the scaffolds). Then the cell-seeded materials were cultured in vitro or implanted in vivo in NOD-SCID mice. The qualitative follow-up involved scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, live-dead assays, and histology. The cell amount was quantified by photon imager during 21 days in vitro and 2 months in vivo. Live- dead assay and SEM revealed that the cells survived after printing and spread onto PCL membranes. Circle-shaped patterns were maintained in vitro during the first week but they were no longer observable after 2 weeks, due to cell proliferation. Luciferase tracking displayed that the cell amount was increased in vitro and in vivo when the materials and the cells where stacked layer by layer.

{"title": "Design Principles for Rapid Prototyping Forces Sensors using 3D Printing.", "abstract": "Force sensors provide critical information for robot manipulators, manufacturing processes, and haptic interfaces. Commercial force sensors, however, are generally not adapted to specific system requirements, resulting in sensors with excess size, cost, and fragility. To overcome these issues, 3D printers can be used to create components for the quick and inexpensive development of force sensors. Limitations of this rapid prototyping technology, however, require specialized design principles. In this paper, we discuss techniques for rapidly developing simple force sensors, including selecting and attaching metal flexures, using inexpensive and simple displacement transducers, and 3D printing features to aid in assembly. These design methods are illustrated through the design and fabrication of a miniature force sensor for the tip of a robotic catheter system. The resulting force sensor prototype can measure forces with an accuracy of as low as 2% of the 10 N measurement range.", "journal": "IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics : a joint publication of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division", "date": "2011-08-30", "authors": ["Samuel BKesner", "Robert DHowe"], "doi": "10.1109/TMECH.2011.2160353"}
{"title": "Effect of deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing on the morphology and cellular response of electrosprayed TiO2 films.", "abstract": "Titania films (TiO(2)) were deposited on Ti alloy substrates by electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), also called electrospraying, and the morphology and phase composition of the coatings were evaluated. A range of TiO(2) sols (2-8 wt%) were prepared via the hydrolysis of polymeric precursors using isopropanol (prOH) as a solvent carrier. Stable cone-jet formation during the EHDA process was greatly influenced by varying the liquid physical properties. Deposition parameters such as sol concentration, needle-to-substrate distance and spray time were found to affect film morphology. Dense and continuous films were obtained under optimized conditions whereby a 2 wt% TiO(2) sol was atomized at a flow rate of 5 \u00b5l min(-1) by a needle of 300 \u00b5m inner diameter, kept at a distance of 20 mm from the grounded substrate and operating at an applied voltage of 3.5-4.2 kV. The films were then crystallized by heating to 300-600 \u00b0C. Annealing increased the hydrophilicity of the films but did not significantly affect the surface roughness of the films. In vitro cellular response was determined by studying the interaction between MG63 cells and the films annealed at the various temperatures. MG63 cells were able to grow and proliferate on all the TiO(2) films, while the highest proliferation rate was found on the TiO(2) films annealed at 600 \u00b0C.

Many tissue-engineering approaches that aim to generate osteochondral implants suffer from poor tissue formation and compromised integration. This illustrates the need for further improvement of heterogeneous tissue constructs. Engineering of these structures is expected to profit from strategies addressing the complexity of tissue organization and the simultaneous use of multiple cell types. Moreover, this enables the investigation of the effects of three-dimensional (3D) organization and architecture on tissue function. In the present study, we characterize the use of a 3D fiber deposition (3DF) technique for the fabrication of cell-laden, heterogeneous hydrogel constructs for potential use as osteochondral grafts. Changing fiber spacing or angle of fiber deposition yielded scaffolds of varying porosity and elastic modulus. We encapsulated and printed fluorescently labeled human chondrocytes and osteogenic progenitors in alginate hydrogel yielding scaffolds of 1\u00d72\u2009cm with different parts for both cell types. Cell viability remained high throughout the printing process, and cells remained in their compartment of the printed scaffold for the whole culture period. Moreover, distinctive tissue formation was observed, both in vitro after 3 weeks and in vivo (6 weeks subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice), at different locations within one construct.

In the last decades great efforts have been undertaken to develop materials for artificial vascular constructs. However, bio-inert materials like ePTFE or PET fail as material for narrow blood vessel replacements (coronary bypasses). Therefore, we aim to design new biocompatible materials to overcome this. In this paper we investigate the use of photoelastomers for artificial vascular constructs since they may be precisely structured by means of additive manufacturing technologies. Hence, 3D computer aided design and manufacturing technologies (CAD-CAM) offer the possibility of creating cellular structures within the grafts that might favour ingrowth of tissue. Different monomer formulations were screened concerning their suitability for this application but all had drawbacks, especially concerning the suture tear resistance. Therefore, we chose to modify the original network architecture by including dithiol chain transfer agents which effectively co-react with the acrylates and reduce crosslink density. A commercial urethane diacrylate was chosen as base monomer. In combination with reactive diluents and dithiols, the properties of the photopolymers could be tailored and degradability could be introduced. The optimized photoelastomers were in good mechanical accordance with native blood vessels, showed good biocompatibility in in vitro tests, degraded similar to poly(lactic acid) and were successfully manufactured with the 3D CAD-CAM technology.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2011-08-19", "authors": ["StefanBaudis", "FranziskaNehl", "S ClarkLigon", "AnnelieseNigisch", "HelgaBergmeister", "DavidBernhard", "J\u00fcrgenStampfl", "RobertLiska"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/6/5/055003"}

In this context, we introduce here a new methodology for the formation of a functional thick hepatic tissue usable for cell sheet technology. First, we report the formation of composite tissue elements in suspension culture. Composite elements were composed of human hepatoma Hep G2 cells and mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts which are important modulators for thick-tissue formation. To overcome the very low attachment and organization capability between different cells in suspension, we synthesized a new cell-to-cell binding molecule based on the avidin-biotin binding system that we previously applied to attach hepatocytes on artificial substrata. This newly synthesized biotin-conjugated biocompatible anchoring molecule was inserted in the plasma membrane of both cell types. NIH/3T3 cells were further conjugated with avidin and incubated with biotin-presenting Hep G2 cells to form highly composite tissue elements. Then, we seeded those elements on highly gas-permeable membranes at their closest packing density to induce the formation of a thick, composite, functional hepatic tissue without any perfusion.

Cell printing and prevascularization of engineered tissues are promising approaches to meet these challenges. However, the printing technologies used in biofabrication must balance the competing parameters of resolution, speed, and volume, which limit the resolution of thicker 3D structures. We suggest that high-resolution conformal printing techniques can be used to print 2D patterns of vascular cells onto biopaper substrates which can then be stacked to form a thicker tissue construct. Towards this end we created 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 300 \u00b5m biopapers to be used as the transferable, stackable substrate for cell printing. 3.6% w/v poly-lactide-co-glycolide was dissolved in chloroform and poured into molds filled with NaCl crystals. The salt was removed with DI water and the scaffolds were dried and loaded with a Collagen Type I or Matrigel. SEM of the biopapers showed extensive porosity and gel loading throughout. Biological laser printing (BioLP) was used to deposit human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a simple intersecting pattern to the surface of the biopapers. The cells differentiated and stretched to form networks preserving the printed pattern. In a separate experiment to demonstrate \"stackability,\" individual biopapers were randomly seeded with HUVECs and cultured for 1 day. The mechanically stable and viable biopapers were then stacked and cultured for 4 days.

In this paper, we create large multi-cellular honeycomb building blocks using directed self-assembly, whereby cell-to-cell adhesion, in the context of the shape and obstacles of a micro-mold, drives the formation of a 3D structure. Computer-aided design, rapid prototyping and replica molding were used to fabricate honeycomb-shaped micro-molds. Nonadhesive hydrogels cast from these micro-molds were equilibrated in the cell culture medium and seeded with two types of mammalian cells. The cells settled into the honeycomb recess were unable to attach to the nonadhesive hydrogel and so cell-to-cell adhesion drove the self-assembly of a large multi-cellular honeycomb within 24 h. Distinct morphological changes occurred to the honeycomb and its cells indicating the presence of significant cell-mediated tension. Unlike the spheroid, whose size is constrained by a critical diffusion distance needed to maintain cell viability, the overall size of the honeycomb is not limited.

Currently, there are many techniques that fabricate three-dimensional scaffolds; however, there are advantages, limitations and specific tissue focuses of each fabrication technique. The focus of this initiative is to utilize an existing technique and expand the library of biomaterials which can be utilized to fabricate three-dimensional scaffolds rather than focusing on a new fabrication technique. An expanded library of biomaterials will enable the precision extrusion deposition (PED) device to construct three-dimensional scaffolds with enhanced biological, chemical and mechanical cues that will benefit tissue generation. Computer-aided motion and extrusion drive the PED to precisely fabricate micro-scaled scaffolds with biologically inspired, porosity, interconnectivity and internal and external architectures. The high printing resolution, precision and controllability of the PED allow for closer mimicry of tissues and organs. The PED expands its library of biopolymers by introducing an assisting cooling (AC) device which increases the working extrusion temperature from 120 to 250 \u00b0C. This paper investigates the PED with the integrated AC's capabilities to fabricate three-dimensional scaffolds that support cell growth, attachment and proliferation.

The CMs were used to encapsulate bovine serum albumin (BSA) and improve the scaffold mechanical properties. Experiments to examine the BSA release were carried out; the BSA release could be controlled by adjusting the crosslink degree of the CMs and prolonged after the CMs were embedded into the PLLA scaffolds, while the examination of the mechanical properties of the scaffolds illustrates that they depend on the ratio of CMs to PLLA in the scaffolds as well as the cryogenic temperature used in the RFP fabrication process. The chemical characteristics of the PLLA/chitosan scaffolds were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The morphological and pore structure of the scaffolds were also examined by scanning electron microscopy and micro-tomography. The results obtained show that the scaffolds have higher porosity and enhanced pore size distribution compared to those fabricated by the dispensing-based rapid prototyping technique.

Quantification with SERS based on signal intensity remains challenging due to the complicated fabrication process to obtain well-dispersed nanoparticles and well-ordered substrates. We report a new biofabrication strategy of SERS substrates that enable quantification through a newly discovered spectroscopic shift resulting from the chitosan-analyte interactions in solution. We demonstrate this phenomenon by the quantification of adenine, which is an essential part of the nucleic acid structure and a key component in pathways which generate signal molecules for bacterial communications. The SERS substrates were fabricated simply by sequential electrodeposition of chitosan on patterned gold electrodes and electroplating of a silver nitrate solution through the chitosan scaffold to form a chitosan-silver nanoparticle composite. Active SERS signals of adenine solutions were obtained in real time from the chitosan-silver composite substrates with a significant concentration-dependent spectroscopic shift. The Lorentzian curve fitting of the dominant peaks suggests the presence of two separate peaks with a concentration-dependent area percentage of the separated peaks. The chitosan-mediated composite SERS substrates can be easily biofabricated on predefined electrodes within microfluidic channels for real-time detection in microsystems.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2011-07-05", "authors": ["X LLuo", "SBuckhout-White", "W EBentley", "G WRubloff"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/3/3/034108"}
{"title": "A functionally gradient variational porosity architecture for hollowed scaffolds fabrication.", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel continuous tool-path planning methodology for hollowed scaffold fabrication in tissue engineering. A new functionally gradient porous architecture is proposed with a continuous material deposition planning scheme. A controllable variational pore size and hence the porosity have been achieved with a combination of two geometrically oriented consecutive layers. The desired porosity has been achieved with consecutive layers by geometrically partitioning each layer into sub-regions based on the area and the tissue scaffold design constraints. A continuous, interconnected and optimized tool-path for layers has been generated for a three-dimensional biomaterial deposition/printing process. A zigzag pattern tool-path has been proposed for an accumulated sub-region layer, and a concentric spiral-like optimal tool-path pattern has been generated for the successive layer to ensure continuity along the structure. Three-dimensional layers, formed by the proposed tool-path plan, vary the pore size and the porosity based on the biological and mechanical requirements. Several examples demonstrate the proposed methodology along with illustrative results. Also a comparative study between the proposed design and conventional Cartesian coordinate scaffolds has been performed. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in design error with the proposed method.

Unfortunately, as yet, no satisfactory therapy to repair necrotic bone at an early stage is present. Novel implants with pre-set channels were designed for the treatment of early femoral head necrosis. Ceramic stereolithography was applied to fabricate the green part from \u03b2-TCP powder.

No significant deformation or crack occurred. X-ray diffraction showed that no facies changed or chemical reaction occurred during the fabrication process. The chemical composition remains the same as that of the original \u03b2-TCP powder. The compressive strength is 23.54 MPa, close to that of natural cancellous bone. Novel implants with a pre-set channel were designed and fabricated for blood vessel implantation.

By controlling the dispense parameters, regular arrays of asymmetric posts were deposited such that the slope of the posts was varied from 0 to 50 relative to the surface normal. Advancing and receding contact angles as well as slip angles were measured as a function of the post slope and droplet volume. Ratchetlike slip angle anisotropy was observed on surfaces composed of sloped features. The maximum slip angle difference (for a 180\u00b0 tilt angle variation) was 32\u00b0 for 20 \u03bcL droplets on surfaces with posts fabricated with a slope of 50\u00b0. This slip angle anisotropy is attributed to an increase in the triple contact line (TCL) length as the droplet is tilted in a direction against the post slope whereas the TCL decreases continuously when the drop travels in a direction parallel to the post slope. The increasing length of the TCL creates an increased energy barrier that accounts for the higher slip angles in this direction.", "journal": "Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids", "date": "2011-06-28", "authors": ["MarkBarahman", "Alan MLyons"], "doi": "10.1021/la201222a"}

Bone scaffold fabrication using additive manufacturing techniques can provide control over pore interconnectivity during fabrication of the scaffold, which helps in mimicking human trabecular bone. 13-93 glass, a third-generation bioactive material designed to accelerate the body's natural ability to heal itself, was used in the research described herein to fabricate bone scaffolds using the selective laser sintering (SLS) process. 13-93 glass mixed with stearic acid (as the polymer binder) by ball milling was used as the powder feedstock for the SLS machine. The fabricated green scaffolds underwent binder burnout to remove the stearic acid binder and were then sintered at temperatures between 675 \u00b0C and 695 \u00b0C. The sintered scaffolds had pore sizes ranging from 300 to 800 \u00b5m with 50% apparent porosity and an average compressive strength of 20.4 MPa, which is excellent for non-load bearing applications and among the highest reported for an interconnected porous scaffold fabricated with bioactive glasses using the SLS process.

HOP bioink was prepared using a 30 million cells ml(-1) suspension in culture medium and cells were characterized after printing using a Live/Dead assay and osteoblastic phenotype markers (alcaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). The results revealed that LAB allows printing and organizing nHA and HOPs in two and three dimensions.

{"title": "Direct-write bioprinting three-dimensional biohybrid systems for future regenerative therapies.", "abstract": "Regenerative medicine seeks to repair or replace dysfunctional tissues with engineered biological or biohybrid systems. Current clinical regenerative models utilize simple uniform tissue constructs formed with cells cultured onto biocompatible scaffolds. Future regenerative therapies will require the fabrication of complex three-dimensional constructs containing multiple cell types and extracellular matrices. We believe bioprinting technologies will provide a key role in the design and construction of future engineered tissues for cell-based and regenerative therapies. This review describes the current state-of-the-art bioprinting technologies, focusing on direct-write bioprinting. We describe a number of process and device considerations for successful bioprinting of composite biohybrid constructs. In addition, we have provided baseline direct-write printing parameters for a hydrogel system (Pluronic F127) often used in cardiovascular applications. Direct-write dispensed lines (gels with viscosities ranging from 30 mPa s to greater than 600 \u00d7 10\u2076 mPa s) were measured following mechanical and pneumatic printing via three commercially available needle sizes (20 ga, 25 ga, and 30 ga). Example patterns containing microvascular cells and isolated microvessel fragments were also bioprinted into composite 3D structures. Cells and vessel fragments remained viable and maintained in vitro behavior after incorporation into biohybrid structures. Direct-write bioprinting of biologicals provides a unique method to design and fabricate complex, multicomponent 3D structures for experimental use. We hope our design insights and baseline parameter descriptions of direct-write bioprinting will provide a useful foundation for colleagues to incorporate this 3D fabrication method into future regenerative therapies.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Substrate stiffness influences high resolution printing of living cells with an ink-jet system.", "abstract": "The adaptation of inkjet printing technology for the realisation of controlled micro- and nano-scaled biological structures is of great potential in tissue and biomaterial engineering. In this paper we present the Olivetti BioJet system and its applications in tissue engineering and cell printing. BioJet, which employs a thermal inkjet cartridge, was used to print biomolecules and living cells. It is well known that high stresses and forces are developed during the inkjet printing process. When printing living particles (i.e., cell suspensions) the mechanical loading profile can dramatically damage the processed cells. Therefore computational models were developed to predict the velocity profile and the mechanical load acting on a droplet during the printing process. The model was used to investigate the role of the stiffness of the deposition substrate during droplet impact and compared with experimental investigations on cell viability after printing on different materials. The computational model and the experimental results confirm that impact forces are highly dependent on the deposition substrate and that soft and viscous surfaces can reduce the forces acting on the droplet, preventing cell damage. These results have high relevance for cell bioprinting; substrates should be designed to have a good compromise between substrate stiffness to conserve spatial patterning without droplet coalescence but soft enough to absorb the kinetic energy of droplets in order to maintain cell viability.", "journal": "Journal of bioscience and bioengineering", "date": "2011-04-19", "authors": ["AnnalisaTirella", "FedericoVozzi", "CarmeloDe Maria", "GiovanniVozzi", "TazioSandri", "DuccioSassano", "LivioCognolato", "ArtiAhluwalia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.03.019"}

SLM is well known for metal parts and offers direct manufacturing of three-dimensional (3D) parts with high bulk density on the base of individual 3D data, including computer tomography models of anatomical structures. Furthermore, an interconnecting porous structure with defined and reproducible pore size can be integrated during the design of the 3D virtual model of the implant. The objective of this study was to develop the SLM processes for a biodegradable composite material made of \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) and poly(D, L)-lactide (PDLLA). The development of a powder composite material (\u03b2-TCP/PDLLA) suitable for the SLM process was successfully performed. The microstructure of the manufactured samples exhibit a homogeneous arrangement of ceramic and polymer. The four-point bending strength was up to 23 MPa. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples confirmed \u03b2-TCP as the only present crystalline phase and the gel permeations chromatography (GPC) analysis documented a degradation of the polymer caused by the laser process less than conventional manufacturing processes.

In this study of photocrosslinked poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) and diethyl fumarate (DEF) scaffolds, the effect of DEF incorporation ratio and pore size on the osteogenic signal expression of rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) was investigated. Results demonstrated that DEF concentrations and pore sizes that led to increased scaffold mechanical stiffness also upregulated osteogenic signal expression, including bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), fibroblast growth factors-2 (FGF-2), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Runx2 transcriptional factor. Similar scaffold fabrication parameters supported rapid BMSC osteoblastic differentiation, as demonstrated by increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin expression. When scaffolds with random architecture, fabricated by porogen leaching, were compared to those with controlled architecture, fabricated by stereolithography (SLA), results showed that SLA scaffolds with the highly permeable and porous channels also have significantly higher expression of FGF-2, TGF-\u03b21, and VEGF. Subsequent ALP expression and osteopontin secretion were also significantly increased in SLA scaffolds. Based upon these results, we conclude that scaffold properties provided by additive manufacturing techniques such as SLA fabrication, particularly increased mechanical stiffness and high permeability, may stimulate dramatic BMSC responses that promote rapid bone tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2011-03-15", "authors": ["KyobumKim", "DavidDean", "JonathanWallace", "RobBreithaupt", "Antonios GMikos", "John PFisher"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.016"}

Presently, the most successful scaffolds are acellular polymer matrices, prepared through lyophilization and phase separation techniques, designed to mimic the dermal extracellular matrix.

Recent advances in biomaterial science have made new techniques available capable of increasing scaffold complexity, allowing the creation of 3D microenvironments that actively control cell behaviour. Importantly, it may be possible through these sophisticated novel techniques, including bio-printing and electrospinning, to accurately direct stem cell behaviour. This complex proposal involves the incorporation of cell-matrix, cell-cell, mechanical cues and soluble factors delivered in a spatially and temporally pertinent manner.

This technique integrated a computer with a device capable of 3D movement allowing for precise motion and control over the polymer scaffold resolution. IVD scaffold structures were designed using computer-aided design to resemble the natural IVD structure. Degradable polyurethane (PU) was used as an elastic scaffold construct to mimic the elastic nature of the native IVD tissue and was deposited at a controlled rate using ultra-fine micropipettes connected to a syringe pump. The elastic PU was extruded directly onto a collecting substrate placed on a freezing stage. The three-dimensional movement of the computer-controlled device combined with the freezing stage enabled precise control of polymer deposition using extrusion. The addition of the freezing stage increased the polymer solution viscosity and hardened the polymer solution as it was extruded out of the micropipette tip. This technique created scaffolds with excellent control over macro- and micro-structure to influence cell behavior, specifically for cell adhesion, proliferation, and alignment. Concentric lamellae were printed at a high resolution to mimic the native shape and structure of the IVD. Seeded cells aligned along the concentric lamellae and acquired cell morphology similar to native tissue in the outer portion of the IVD.

The average time to bend a plate on a nonsterile model was 0.42 h (range 0.25-0.68 h). This is felt to represent the minimum amount of time saved during the operation. Additive manufacture of the mandible prior to resection and reconstruction with a microvascular flap is a useful technique which reduces the operating time.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2011-02-08", "authors": ["BerndLethaus", "LucasPoort", "RolandB\u00f6ckmann", "RalfSmeets", "ReneTolba", "PeterKessler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2011.01.007"}

The surface consists of a micro-scale grating pattern of alternate silver electrodes and SU-8 partitions with a minimum feature size of 20 \u00b5m, and activated by an external voltage. In this study, prototype coupons (15 mm \u00d7 15 mm) of the antibacterial surface were fabricated on silicon substrates using two sets of lithographies, and analyzed for their physical characteristics using microscopy and surface profilometry. The prototypes were also electrically analyzed to determine their current-voltage characteristics, and hence silver ion (Ag(+)) release concentrations. Finally, they were tested for their antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) using a newly engineered microbiological testing procedure. The antibacterial efficacy testing results show significant reductions in the number of viable organisms of both the species after 45 min of testing with 15 \u00b5A system current.

Nanocomposites that consist of biodegradable polymers and osteoconductive bioceramic nanoparticles and advanced scaffold manufacturing techniques, such as rapid prototyping (RP) technologies, have attracted much attention for developing new bone tissue engineering strategies. In the current study, poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) microspheres and calcium phosphate (Ca-P)/PHBV nanocomposite microspheres were fabricated using the oil-in-water (O/W) and solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) emulsion solvent evaporation methods. The microspheres with suitable sizes were then used as raw materials for scaffold fabrication via selective laser sintering (SLS), which is a mature RP technique. A three-factor three-level complete factorial design was applied to investigate the effects of the three factors (laser power, scan spacing, and layer thickness) in SLS and to optimize SLS parameters for producing good-quality PHBV polymer scaffolds and Ca-P/PHBV nanocomposite scaffolds. The plots of the main effects of these three factors and the three-dimensional response surface were constructed and discussed. Based on the regression equation, optimized PHBV scaffolds and Ca-P/PHBV scaffolds were fabricated using the optimized values of SLS parameters. Characterization of optimized PHBV scaffolds and Ca-P/PHBV scaffolds verified the optimization process. It has also been demonstrated that SLS has the capability of constructing good-quality, sophisticated porous structures of complex shape, which some tissue engineering applications may require.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2011-01-20", "authors": ["BinDuan", "Wai LamCheung", "MinWang"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/3/1/015001"}

The goal in this study is to assess a local heating phenomenon with a single patterned cluster of gold nanorods that are prepared as a wet chemically synthesized gold nanorod solution and mixed with aqueous 1% alginate and 0.1 M calcium chloride. In particular, we utilized the initiated chemical vapor deposition method to coat the cluster with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) to enhance its high temperature resistance in the solution. The influence of the thermal energy on the surroundings is studied by measuring the surface temperature of the single patterned gold nanorod cluster as a function of laser irradiation time. The experimental results were compared with numerical simulation results. The results showed that the irradiated gold nanorods could rapidly heat to maximum surface temperatures of over 60 \u00b0C within 120 s. Furthermore, the temperature remained almost constant (i.e. reached a steady state) under continuous laser irradiation and rapidly cooled to the initial temperature within 90 s when the laser was turned off.", "journal": "Biofabrication", "date": "2011-01-20", "authors": ["WonjinJo", "KevinFreedman", "Dong KeeYi", "Ranjita KBose", "Kenneth K SLau", "Sally DSolomon", "Min JunKim"], "doi": "10.1088/1758-5082/3/1/015002"}

Consequently important aspects of synthesis related to control of shape and size through economical and non-hazardous means are desirable. Highly efficient bioreduction-based fabrication approaches that utilize microbes and/or plant extracts are poised to meet these needs. Here we show that the \u03b3-proteobacterium Shewanella oneidensis can reduce tetrachloroaurate (III) ions to produce discrete extracellular spherical gold nanocrystallites. The particles were homogeneously shaped with multiple size distributions and produced under ambient conditions at high yield, 88% theoretical maximum. Further characterization revealed that the particles consist of spheres in the size range of \u223c2-50 nm, with an average size of 12\u00b15 nm. The nanoparticles were hydrophilic and resisted aggregation even after several months. Based on our experiments, the particles are likely fabricated by the aid of reducing agents present in the bacterial cell membrane and are capped by a detachable protein/peptide coat. Ultraviolet-visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectra and transmission electron microscopy measurements confirmed the formation, surface characteristics and crystalline nature of the nanoparticles. The antibacterial activity of these gold nanoparticles was assessed using Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and S. oneidensis) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) bacterial species.

{"title": "Controlled Positioning of Cells in Biomaterials-Approaches Towards 3D Tissue Printing.", "abstract": "Current tissue engineering techniques have various drawbacks: they often incorporate uncontrolled and imprecise scaffold geometries, whereas the current conventional cell seeding techniques result mostly in random cell placement rather than uniform cell distribution. For the successful reconstruction of deficient tissue, new material engineering approaches have to be considered to overcome current limitations. An emerging method to produce complex biological products including cells or extracellular matrices in a controlled manner is a process called bioprinting or biofabrication, which effectively uses principles of rapid prototyping combined with cell-loaded biomaterials, typically hydrogels. 3D tissue printing is an approach to manufacture functional tissue layer-by-layer that could be transplanted in vivo after production. This method is especially advantageous for stem cells since a controlled environment can be created to influence cell growth and differentiation. Using printed tissue for biotechnological and pharmacological needs like in vitro drug-testing may lead to a revolution in the pharmaceutical industry since animal models could be partially replaced by biofabricated tissues mimicking human physiology and pathology. This would not only be a major advancement concerning rising ethical issues but would also have a measureable impact on economical aspects in this industry of today, where animal studies are very labor-intensive and therefore costly.

A good amount of thoughtful work has also yielded prototypes of other tissue substitutes such as nerve conduits, blood vessels, liver, and even heart. Forward movement to clinical product, however, has been slow. Another offshoot of these efforts has been the incorporation of some new exciting technologies (e.g., microfabrication, 3D printing) that may enable future breakthroughs. In this review we highlight the modest beginnings of the field and then describe three application examples that are in various stages of development, ranging from relatively mature (skin) to ongoing proof-of-concept (cartilage) to early stage (liver).

The case report describes a method based on computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and rapid prototyping nanoscale hydroxyapatite/polyamide (n-HA/PA) for individual design, fabrication, and implantation of a mandibular condyle. A 27-year-old woman with a square-shaped face who had previously undergone mandibular angle reduction reported with malocclusion, deviated mouth, collapse of the right side of the face, and masticatory problems.

Such scaffolds can be achieved by controlling their structure and porosity and are termed functionally graded scaffolds (FGS). Currently, the main challenges in FGS fabrication include the iterative and tedious design process as well as a heavy reliance on the user's CAD/CAM skills. This work aims to bring automated FGS production a step closer by providing a database that correlates scaffold porosity values and the corresponding compressive stiffness and integrating it into the design process. To achieve this goal, scaffolds with different structural configurations were designed using CASTS (Computer Aided System for Tissue Scaffolds), an in-house developed library system consisting of 13 different polyhedral units that can be assembled into scaffold structures. Polycaprolactone (PCL) was chosen as the scaffold material, while selective laser sintering, a powder-based rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing system was employed to fabricate the scaffolds. Mathematical relations correlating scaffold porosity and compressive stiffness readings were formulated and compiled. In addition, cytotoxicity assessment was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of the fabricated PCL scaffolds. Lastly, a brief demonstration of how the formulated relations are used in the FGS design process is presented.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2010-10-05", "authors": ["NSudarmadji", "J YTan", "K FLeong", "C KChua", "Y TLoh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2010.09.024"}
