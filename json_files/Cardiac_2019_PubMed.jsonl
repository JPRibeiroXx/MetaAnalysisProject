{"title": "Key aspects for effective mathematical modelling of fractional-diffusion in cardiac electrophysiology: a quantitative study.", "abstract": "Microscopic structural features of cardiac tissue play a fundamental role in determining complex spatio-temporal excitation dynamics at the macroscopic level. Recent efforts have been devoted to the development of mathematical models accounting for non-local spatio-temporal coupling able to capture these complex dynamics without the need of resolving tissue heterogeneities down to the micro-scale. In this work, we analyse in detail several important aspects affecting the overall predictive power of these modelling tools and provide some guidelines for an effective use of space-fractional models of cardiac electrophysiology in practical applications. Through an extensive computational study in simplified computational domains, we highlight the robustness of models belonging to different categories, i.e., physiological and phenomenological descriptions, against the introduction of non-locality, and lay down the foundations for future research and model validation against experimental data. A modern genetic algorithm framework is used to investigate proper parameterisations of the considered models, and the crucial role played by the boundary assumptions in the considered settings is discussed.

{"title": "Design and characterization of an electroconductive scaffold for cardiomyocytes based biomedical assays.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major cause of mortality worldwide. Accessibility to heart tissue is limited due to sampling issues and lack of appropriate culture conditions. In addition, animal models are not an ideal choice for physiological, pharmacological, and fundamental evaluations in the cardiovascular field due to interspecies differences. Hence, there is an inevitable need for functional in vitro cardiac models. In this study, we have synthesized a novel electroconductive scaffold comprised of cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) derived pre-cardiogel (pCG) blended with polypyrrole (Ppy). Our data revealed that 2.5% (w/v) pyrrole (Py) had the highest possible Py ratio that provided pCG-Ppy gel formation. The prepared mixture was fabricated into a scaffold by using the freeze-dried method. The scaffolds had open interconnected pores that ranged from 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0\u03bcm for the cardiogel (CG)-Ppy to 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026\u00a0\u03bcm for the CG scaffolds, with no alterations in vital ECM components of collagen, polysaccharides, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Incorporation of Ppy increased the CG stiffness with a final complex modulus from 80 pa to 140 pa. The CG-Ppy group had significantly greater electrical conductivity than the CG group. Scaffolds supported neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte (NMCM) adhesion, viability, cardiac-specific gene expression, and spontaneous beating up to 14\u00a0days after seeding. Among the fabricated hydrogels, the CG-Ppy group resulted in the synchronous beating of cardiomyocyte clusters and upregulation of cardiac genes involved in cardiac muscle contraction (cardiac troponin T [cTNT]) and cardiomyocyte electrical coupling (connexin 43 [Cx43]).

We have previously studied the effect of ouabain, an endogenous cardiac glycoside, on the physiology of epithelial cells, and we have shown that in concentrations in the nanomolar range, it affects key properties of epithelial cells, such as tight junction, apical basolateral polarization, gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), and adherent junctions. In this work, we study the influence of digoxin and marinobufagenin, two other endogenously expressed cardiac glycosides, on GJIC as well as the degree of transepithelial tightness due to tight junction integrity (TJ). We evaluated GJIC by dye transfer assays and tight junction integrity by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) measurements, as well as immunohistochemistry and western blot assays of expression of claudins 2 and 4. We found that both digoxin and marinobufagenin improve GJIC and significantly enhance the tightness of the tight junctions, as evaluated from TER measurements. Immunofluorescence assays show that both compounds promote enhanced basolateral localization of claudin-4 but not claudin 2, while densitometric analysis of western blot assays indicate a significantly increased expression of claudin 4.

Groups were defined as follows: control (Group 1), sham (Group 2), clopidogrel pre-treatment (Group 3), and rivaroxaban pre-treatment (Group 4). Ischemia (6 h) and reperfusion (8 h) were induced at the lower hind limb in Groups 2, 3, and 4.

Clopidogrel and rivaroxaban pre-treatment significantly decreased malondialdehyde levels, compared to the heart, ischemic muscle, liver, and blood tissues of the sham group. Kidney malondialdehyde levels were reduced only by rivaroxaban. Group 4 had significantly decreased malondialdehyde levels, compared to Group 3 in ischemic muscle (p<0.010). The glutathione reduction, compared to sham group, in the kidney was only significant for Group 4 (p<0.050). With clopidogrel and rivaroxaban pretreatment, nitric oxide levels significantly decreased only in the heart tissue, compared to sham group (p<0.001 and p<0.050, respectively).\nThe study results suggest that rivaroxaban and clopidogrel are effective in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart, ischemic muscle, liver, and blood.

{"title": "Vacuolated cardiomyocytes in human endomyocardial biopsy specimens.", "abstract": "We encountered an unfamiliar finding during electron microscopic examination of an endomyocardial biopsy obtained from a 55-year-old woman suffering from heart failure due to dilated phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many cardiomyocytes contained large vacuoles that were mainly empty except for small amounts of amorphous substrate. These were not autophagic vacuoles, as they lacked limiting membranes. Six years later, we encountered similar histological findings in three successive biopsies sourced from another hospital. They were obtained from a 77-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a 28-year-old woman with endocardial fibrosis, and a 33-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy. This biopsy was the second for the endocardial fibrosis patient, and her first biopsy showed no vacuoles within cardiomyocytes. Close inspection of the procedures revealed that in all of these cases the fixed biopsy specimens were carried to the hospital from other institutes using a refrigerated courier service. We then fixed rat heart tissues, froze them once, and processed them for electron microscopy. In that experiment, we were able to reproduce the vacuolar cardiomyocytes, thereby demonstrating it to be a laboratory artifact. We therefore want to emphasize to physicians not to freeze biopsy specimens and not to use a refrigerated courier service for their transport. <", "journal": "Journal of cardiology cases", "date": "2020-02-12", "authors": ["GenzouTakemura", "KenjiOnoue", "TakanoriArimoto", "TetsuWatanabe", "AkikoTsujimoto", "ChihiroTakada", "HideshiOkada", "TomoyaNakano", "YasuhiroSakaguchi", "NagisaMiyazaki", "TakatomoWatanabe", "HiromitsuKanamori", "ShinjiOgura", "YoshihikoSaito", "TakakoFujiwara", "HisayoshiFujiwara", "YasuakiHotta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jccase.2019.09.012"}
{"title": "Energetics Equivalent of the Cardiac Force-Length End-Systolic Zone: Implications for Contractility and Economy of Contraction.", "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated the existence of a region on the cardiac mechanics stress-length plane, which we have designated \"The cardiac end-systolic zone.\" The zone is defined as the area on the pressure-volume (or stress-length) plane within which all stress-length contraction profiles reach their end-systolic points. It is enclosed by three boundaries: the isometric end-systolic relation, the work-loop (shortening) end-systolic relation, and the zero-active stress isotonic end-systolic relation. The existence of this zone reflects the contraction-mode dependence of the cardiac end-systolic force-length relations, and has been confirmed in a range of cardiac preparations at the whole-heart, tissue and myocyte levels. This finding has led us to speculate that a comparable zone prevails for cardiac metabolism. Specifically, we hypothesize the existence of an equivalent zone on the energetics plane (heat vs. stress), and that it can be attributed to the recently-revealed heat of shortening in cardiac muscle. To test these hypotheses, we subjected trabeculae to both isometric contractions and work-loop contractions over wide ranges of preloads and afterloads. We found that the heat-stress relations for work-loop contractions were distinct from those of isometric contractions, mirroring the contraction mode-dependence of the stress-length relation. The zone bounded by these contraction-mode dependent heat-stress relations reflects the heat of shortening. Isoproterenol-induced enhancement of contractility led to proportional increases in the zones on both the mechanics and energetics planes, thereby supporting our hypothesis.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2020-02-11", "authors": ["KennethTran", "Andrew JTaberner", "Denis SLoiselle", "June-ChiewHan"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2019.01633\n10.1161/01.res.50.4.491\n10.1007/bf01907501\n10.1038/icb.1967.37\n10.1146/annurev.ph.41.030179.002451\n10.1093/cvr/6.5.508\n10.1007/bf00579854\n10.1152/ajpheart.00763.2018\n10.1152/ajpheart.00454.2010\n10.1098/rspb.1938.0050\n10.1161/01.res.62.3.452\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2014.06.005\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.t01-3-00221.x\n10.1161/hh1001.091640\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.2001.03416.x\n10.1007/bf01907858\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.t01-1-00205.x\n10.1007/s00360-007-0223-y\n10.1007/s10974-005-9005-x\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.09.029\n10.1113/JP274837\n10.1016/0014-5793(80)80219-5\n10.1007/s00424-018-2125-0\n10.1006/jmcc.1997.0401\n10.1161/01.res.74.3.542\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00752.2011\n10.1109/tim.2018.2800838\n10.1093/cvr/26.2.179\n10.1113/JP274680\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.497bt.x"}

South Texas is a hotspot for triatomines, T. cruzi-infected dogs and wildlife, and local transmission to humans also occurs. However, little is known about the infection of domestic cats (Felis catus) in the United States. Given the role cats play in the ecology of T. cruzi in Mexico and South America, we hypothesized that T. cruzi infection occurs in cats from south Texas, sometimes associated with cardiac pathology. In 2017, 167 euthanized cats from a south Texas shelter were sampled across winter, spring, and summer. We collected whole blood and hearts from all cats, with additional tissues from a subset. Serum samples were screened for T. cruzi antibodies using two independent rapid immunochromatographic tests and an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Cats were considered seropositive if they were positive on at least two independent serological tests. Blood clot, heart tissue and other tissues were subjected to qPCR for parasite detection and discrete typing unit (DTU) determination. Tissues from selected seropositive or PCR-positive animals and a subset of negative animals were processed routinely for histopathology and examined by a board-certified pathologist. A total of 19 cats (11.4%) were seropositive and three cats (1.8%) - one of which was seropositive - had one or more PCR-positive tissues. Infected tissues included heart, bicep femoris muscle, sciatic nerve, esophagus, and mesentery. Genotyping of the parastite to the level of DTU showed that exclusively DTU TcI was present, despite past studies showing both TcI and TcIV in vectors of the region. Eight of 19 (42.1%) seropositive cats exhibited lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, sometimes with fibrosis, in cardiac tissue compared to 28.6% of 28 seronegative cats (P = 0.10). Domestic cats are affected hosts in the eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease. Future prospective studies are needed to understand disease progression.

Among them, magnetic targeting consists of magnetic systems (magnets or coils) which can impress high gradient magnetic fields and then magnetic forces on the magnetic nanoparticles. Despite some studies have reported an effective improvement in drug delivery by using this technique, there is still a paucity of studies able to quantify and explain the experimental results. In this scenario, \"in silico\" models allow to analyze and compare different magnetic targeting systems in their ability to generate the required magnetic field gradient for specific human targets.In this paper we then evaluated, by means of computational electromagnetics techniques, the attitude of various ad-hoc designed magnetic systems in targeting the heart tissues of differently aged human anatomical models.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

{"title": "Deep CNN with LM learning based myocardial ischemia detection in cardiac magnetic resonance images.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a chronic dysfunction caused by deterioration in cardiac physiology. It results in about 31% of mortality worldwide. Among CVDs, myocardial ischemia (MI) leads to restriction in blood supply to heart tissues. There is a need to develop an effective computer aided detection (CAD) system to reduce the fatality. In this work, an attempt is made to perform mass screening of myocardial ischemic subjects and left ventricle (LV) volume estimation from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning. LV volume measurement is an important predictor of myocardial ischemia. The CMR samples used in this analysis are obtained from Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2009 database. The results of the proposed model are compared with deep CNN based on gradient descent (GD) learning algorithm. The results show that deep CNN architecture with LM learning classifies ischemic subjects with high accuracy (86.39%) and sensitivity (90%). The LM learning based method gives an AUC of 0.93. The estimated LV volumes obtained from the trained network gives high correlation with the ground truth. Thus the results support that proposed framework of deep CNN architecture with LM learning can be used as an effective CAD system for diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Previously, it was found that G.\u00a0acuta ameliorated cardiac function and inhibited isoproterenol (ISO)\u2011induced myocardial fibrosis in rats. In this study, the underlying anti\u2011fibrotic mechanism of G.\u00a0acuta was further elucidated. Histopathological changes in the heart were observed by hematoxylin\u2011eosin, Masson trichrome and wheat germ agglutinin staining. Relevant molecular events were investigated using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The results revealed that G.\u00a0acuta caused improvements in myocardial injury and fibrosis. G.\u00a0acuta also inhibited collagens\u00a0I\u00a0and\u00a0III and \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin production in heart tissue. G.\u00a0acuta downregulated the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21) and notably inhibited the levels of phosphorylation of TGF\u2011\u03b2 receptors\u00a0I and II.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used clinical chemotherapy drug that can mediate cardiac injury through a variety of mechanisms. Thyroxine is well known to play a critical role in energy generation; thus, this study is aimed at investigating whether thyroxine can attenuate DOX-induced cardiac injury by regulating energy generation.\nFirst, the effect of DOX on adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratios in mice was assessed. In addition, thyroxine was given to mice before they were treated with DOX to investigate the effects of thyroxine on DOX-induced cardiac injury. Furthermore, to determine whether the liver kinase b1 (LKB1)/adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis mediated the effect of thyroxine on DOX-induced cardiac injury, thyroxine was given to DOX-treated LKB1 knockout (KO) mice.\nDOX treatment time- and dose-dependently increased the ADP/ATP ratio. Thyroxine treatment also reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) levels in both serum and heart tissue and alleviated cardiac dysfunction in DOX-treated mice. Furthermore, thyroxine reversed DOX-induced reductions in LKB1 and AMPK phosphorylation; mitochondrial complex I, III, and IV activity; and mitochondrial swelling and reversed DOX-induced increases in mTOR pathway phosphorylation and myocardial cell apoptosis. These effects of thyroxine on DOX-treated mice were significantly attenuated by LKB1 KO.\nThyroxine alleviates energy failure, reduces myocardial cell apoptosis, and protects against DOX-induced cardiac injury via the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR axis in mice.

Information on the activity of cardiac sympathetic innervation is non-homogeneous and incomplete. The aim of our study was to evaluate the tonic effect of SNS on heart rate, norepinephrine turnover and direct and indirect effects of norepinephrine in left ventricles of subtotally nephrectomized rats (SNX) in comparison with sham-operated animals (SHAM). Renal failure was verified by measuring serum creatinine and urea levels. SNX rats developed increased heart rates and blood pressure (BP). The increase in heart rate was not caused by sympathetic overactivity as the negative chronotropic effect of metipranolol did not differ between the SNX and SHAM animals. The positive inotropic effects of norepinephrine and tyramine on papillary muscle were not significantly different. Norepinephrine turnover was measured after the administration of tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, pargyline, tyramine, desipramine, and KCl induced depolarization. The absolute amount of released norepinephrine was comparable in both groups despite a significantly decreased norepinephrine concentration in the cardiac tissue of the SNX rats.

Here, we sought to understand the effect that excessive shRNAs have on muscle miRNAs by treating mice with recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) that produce shRNAs with 19-nt or 21-nt stem sequences. Small RNA sequencing of their muscle and liver tissues revealed that shRNA expression was highest in the heart, where mice experienced substantial cardiomyopathy when shRNAs accumulated to 51.2%\u00a0\u00b1 13.7% of total small RNAs. With the same treatment, shRNAs in other muscle tissues reached only 12.1%\u00a0\u00b1 5.0% of total small RNAs. Regardless of treatment, the predominant heart miRNAs remained relatively stable across samples. Instead, the lower-expressed miR-451, one of the few miRNAs processed independently of Dicer, changed in relation to shRNA level and toxicity. Our data suggest that a protective mechanism exists in cardiac tissue for maintaining the levels of most miRNAs in response to shRNA delivery, in contrast with what has been shown in the liver. Quantifying miRNA profiles after excessive shRNA delivery illuminates the host response to rAAV-shRNA, allowing for safer and more robust therapeutic gene knockdown.", "journal": "Molecular therapy.

We and others have previously identified transglutaminase 2 (TG2) as a participant in adverse fibrogenic remodeling. However, little is known about the biologic mechanisms that regulate TG2 function. We examined physiological mouse models of experimental PH, HF, and type 1 diabetes that are associated with altered glucose metabolism/glycolysis and report here that TG2 expression and activity are elevated in pulmonary and cardiac tissues under all these conditions. We additionally used PA adventitial fibroblasts to test the hypothesis that TG2 is an intermediary between enhanced tissue glycolysis and fibrogenesis. Our in vitro results show that glycolytic enzymes and TG2 are upregulated in fibroblasts exposed to high glucose, which stimulates cellular glycolysis as measured by Seahorse analysis. We examined the relationship of TG2 to a terminal glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and found that PKM2 regulates glucose-induced TG2 expression and activity as well as fibrogenesis. Our studies further show that TG2 inhibition blocks glucose-induced fibrogenesis and cell proliferation.

Among cardiovascular diseases, the largest single cause of death is ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease typically manifests as progressive constriction of the coronary arteries, which obstructs blood flow to the heart and can ultimately lead to myocardial infarction. This adversely affects the structure and function of the heart. Conventional treatments lack the ability to treat the myocardium lost during an acute myocardial infarction. Stem cell therapy offers an excellent solution for myocardial regeneration. Stem cell sources such as adult stem cells, embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have been the focal point of research in cardiac tissue engineering. However, cell survival and engraftment post-transplantation are major limitations that must be addressed prior to widespread use of this technology. Recently, biomaterials have been introduced as 3D vehicles to facilitate stem cell transplantation into infarct sites. This has shown significant promise with improved cell survival after transplantation. In this review, we discuss the various injectable hydrogels that have been tried in cardiac tissue engineering. Exploring and optimizing these cell-material interactions will guide cardiac tissue engineering towards developing stem cell based functional 3D constructs for cardiac regeneration.", "journal": "Reviews in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2020-01-09", "authors": ["Keshav NarayanAlagarsamy", "WeiangYan", "AbhaySrivastava", "VincenzoDesiderio", "SanjivDhingra"], "doi": "10.31083/j.rcm.2019.04.534"}

So, the aim of this study is to explore the negative effects of Deca-Durabolin abuse in cardiac and gonadal ultra-structures during an administration cycle.\nFor our purpose, study was performed on 40 male adult mices. Animals were divided into five groups of 8 animals each treated weekly by Deca-Durabolin (nandrolone decanoate) at 30\u00a0g/kg of BW during one month (GI); during two months (GII); during three months (GIII); during three months followed by six weeks of treatment discontinuation (GIV) and Control (C). Cytohistological examinations to determine the histopathological damage properties of the heart and tests were performed.\nOur results showed that the animals supported very well the administrated substance. Our study showed important degenerative changes in cardiac and gonadal tissues after one months of androgen abuse. These damages increases with the duration of treatment with well marked cell lesions, and worsen again 6\u00a0weeks after stopping treatment in cardiac tissue, whereas the gonadal tissue does not recover completely during this period.\nThese results ported that the use of AAS with \"Cycling\" may lead to irreversibly destroy the heart tissue.

{"title": "Delay differential equation-based models of cardiac tissue: Efficient implementation and effects on spiral-wave dynamics.", "abstract": "Delay differential equations (DDEs) recently have been used in models of cardiac electrophysiology, particularly in studies focusing on electrical alternans, instabilities, and chaos. A number of processes within cardiac cells involve delays, and DDEs can potentially represent mechanisms that result in complex dynamics both at the cellular level and at the tissue level, including cardiac arrhythmias. However, DDE-based formulations introduce new computational challenges due to the need for storing and retrieving past values of variables at each spatial location. Cardiac tissue simulations that use DDEs may require over 28\u2009GB of memory if the history of variables is not managed carefully. This paper addresses both computational and dynamical issues. First, we present new methods for the numerical solution of DDEs in tissue to mitigate the memory requirements associated with the history of variables. The new methods exploit the different time scales of an action potential to dynamically optimize history size. We find that the proposed methods decrease memory usage by up to 95% in cardiac tissue simulations compared to straightforward history-management algorithms. Second, we use the optimized methods to analyze for the first time the dynamics of wave propagation in two-dimensional cardiac tissue for models that include DDEs. In particular, we study the effects of DDEs on spiral-wave dynamics, including wave breakup and chaos, using a canine myocyte model. We find that by introducing delays to the gating variables governing the calcium current, DDEs can induce spiral-wave breakup in 2D cardiac tissue domains.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2020-01-03", "authors": ["JohnnyMoreira Gomes", "MarceloLobosco", "RodrigoWeber Dos Santos", "Elizabeth MCherry"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5128240"}
{"title": "Inhibition of the proteasome preserves Mitofusin-2 and mitochondrial integrity, protecting cardiomyocytes during ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte loss is the main cause of myocardial dysfunction following an ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial network dynamics play central roles in cardiomyocyte death. Proteasome inhibition is cardioprotective in the setting of IR; however, the mechanisms underlying this protection are not well-understood. Several proteins that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and energy metabolism, including Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), are degraded by the proteasome. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether proteasome inhibition can protect cardiomyocytes from IR damage by maintaining Mfn2 levels and preserving mitochondrial network integrity. Using ex vivo Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and in vitro neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, we showed that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reduced IR-induced cardiomyocyte death. Moreover, MG132 preserved mitochondrial mass, prevented mitochondrial network fragmentation, and abolished IR-induced reductions in Mfn2 levels in heart tissue and cultured cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, Mfn2 overexpression also prevented cardiomyocyte death. This effect was apparently specific to Mfn2, as overexpression of Miro1, another protein implicated in mitochondrial dynamics, did not confer the same protection. Our results suggest that proteasome inhibition protects cardiomyocytes from IR damage. This effect could be partly mediated by preservation of Mfn2 and therefore mitochondrial integrity.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

{"title": "The Role of Cyclic AMP Signaling in Cardiac Fibrosis.", "abstract": "Myocardial stress and injury invariably promote remodeling of the cardiac tissue, which is associated with cardiomyocyte death and development of fibrosis. The fibrotic process is initially triggered by the differentiation of resident cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These activated fibroblasts display increased proliferative capacity and secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix. Uncontrolled myofibroblast activation can thus promote heart stiffness, cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, and progression to heart failure. Despite the well-established role of myofibroblasts in mediating cardiac disease, our current knowledge on how signaling pathways promoting fibrosis are regulated and coordinated in this cell type is largely incomplete. In this respect, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling acts as a major modulator of fibrotic responses activated in fibroblasts of injured or stressed hearts. In particular, accumulating evidence now suggests that upstream cAMP modulators including G protein-coupled receptors, adenylyl cyclases (ACs), and phosphodiesterases (PDEs); downstream cAMP effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac; and cAMP signaling organizers such as A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) modulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes involved in myocardial fibrosis including myofibroblast differentiation, proliferation, collagen secretion, and invasiveness.

We investigated the therapeutic effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in DM rats and its effect on endoplasmic reticulum stress.\nSD rats with SPF grade were randomly divided into 6 groups: non-DM rats were divided into the sham operation group (NDM-S group), ischemia-reperfusion group (NDM-IR group), and dexmedetomidine group (NDM-DEX group); DM rats were divided into the diabetic sham operation group (DM-S group), diabetes-reperfusion group (DM-IR group), and diabetes-dexmedetomidine (DM-DEX) group, with 10 rats in each group. Then the effects of DEX on the changes of CK-MB and cTnT levels were examined. The effects of myocardial pathological damage and myocardial infarct size were detected. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was detected. The apoptosis of heart tissue cells was also tested through the expressions of cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins. The expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins GRP78, CHOP, ERO1\nThe myocardial damage of DM-IR was more severe than that of NDM-IR rats. DEX could reduce the expression of CK-MB and cTnT, reduce pathological damage, and reduce scar formation and improve fibrosis.

{"title": "Phosphocreatine Improves Cardiac Dysfunction by Normalizing Mitochondrial Respiratory Function through JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway ", "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the common cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that DCM is thoroughly related to mitochondrial energy impairment and increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, an ongoing study is developing strategies to protect cardiac mitochondria from diabetic complications, especially from hyperglycemia. Phosphocreatine (PCr) plays a major metabolic role in cardiac muscular cells including intracellular concentration of ATP which affects the activity of the myocardium. We hypothesized that PCr might improve oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity in mitochondria impaired by hyperglycemia in vivo and in vitro. Also, we aimed to evaluate the protective effect of PCr against DCM through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The mitochondrial respiratory capacity from rats and H9C2 cells was measured by high-resolution respirometry (HRR). Expressions of proteins Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3, caspase 9, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved caspase 9, as well as JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways, were determined by western blotting. ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured with fluorescent probes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was induced in Wistar male rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (80\u2009mg/kg body weight). Our results revealed that PCr possessed protective effects against DCM injury by improving the mitochondrial bioenergetics and by positively exerting protective effects against DCM in vivo and in vitro, not only improving diabetes symptom, resulting in changes of cardiac tissue using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, but also ameliorating biochemical changes. Moreover, PCr increased Bcl-2, caspase 3, and caspase 9 protein expressions and decreased Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved caspase 9 expressions as well as the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, PCr improves mitochondrial functions and exerts an antiapoptotic effect in vivo and in vitro exposed to oxidative stress by hyperglycemia through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that PCr medication is a possible therapeutic strategy for cardioprotection.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2019-12-31", "authors": ["EskandarQaed", "JiaqiWang", "MarwanAlmoiliqy", "YanlinSong", "WuLiu", "PengChu", "SawsanAlademi", "MariaAlademi", "HailongLi", "MohammedAlshwmi", "MahmoudAl-Azab", "AnilAhsan", "SamarMahdi", "GuozhuHan", "MengyueNiu", "AmrAli", "AbdullahShopit", "HongyanWang", "XiaodongLi", "AbdullahQaid", "XiaodongMa", "TongLi", "JinyongPeng", "JingMa", "JianbinZhang", "ZeyaoTang"], "doi": "10.1155/2019/6521218\n10.1111/jdi.12250\n10.1111/jdi.12603\n10.3390/molecules22010129\n10.1111/jcmm.13041\n10.1172/JCI24405\n10.1073/pnas.1300741110\n10.1111/bph.12475\n10.1159/000438580\n10.1139/cjpp-2017-0074\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.12.017\n10.3390/biom5031319\n10.1155/2016/9156510\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.115\n10.2337/diabetes.51.6.1938\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.07.022\n10.2337/db13-1577\n10.1152/physrev.2000.80.3.1107\n10.1007/s10495-016-1215-8\n10.1016/j.pharep.2014.05.013\n10.1093/icvts/ivw171\n10.3109/08977194.2012.660936\n10.1016/j.biosystems.2007.05.005\n10.2147/dddt.s109287\n10.1152/ajpheart.00181.2007\n10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00325-5\n10.1007/978-1-61779-382-0_3\n10.3109/07435800.2015.1094489\n10.1155/2017/1092015\n10.1172/JCI60329\n10.1016/j.fct.2013.11.013\n10.1038/aps.2017.50\n10.1007/s11010-016-2890-z\n10.1016/j.vph.2016.08.012\n10.1007/s10495-015-1175-4\n10.1074/jbc.M115.641514\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.05.036\n10.1016/S0925-4439(02)00212-0\n10.1038/s41598-017-06523-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0132402\n10.1155/2013/924128\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01743.x\n10.3390/ijms131216241\n10.1152/ajpcell.00006.2014\n10.2337/db10-1106"}
{"title": "Prediabetes Induced by Fructose-Enriched Diet Influences Cardiac Lipidome and Proteome and Leads to Deterioration of Cardiac Function prior to the Development of Excessive Oxidative Stress and Cell Damage.", "abstract": "Prediabetes is a condition affecting more than 35% of the population. In some forms, excessive carbohydrate intake (primarily refined sugar) plays a prominent role. Prediabetes is a symptomless, mostly unrecognized disease which increases cardiovascular risk. In our work, we examined the effect of a fructose-enriched diet on cardiac function and lipidome as well as proteome of cardiac muscle. Male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. The control group received a normal diet while the fructose-fed group received 60% fructose-supplemented chow for 24 weeks. Fasting blood glucose measurement and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed slightly but significantly elevated values due to fructose feeding indicating development of a prediabetic condition. Both echocardiography and isolated working heart perfusion performed at the end of the feeding protocol demonstrated diastolic cardiac dysfunction in the fructose-fed group. Mass spectrometry-based, high-performance lipidomic and proteomic analyses were executed from cardiac tissue. The lipidomic analysis revealed complex rearrangement of the whole lipidome with special emphasis on defects in cardiolipin remodeling. The proteomic analysis showed significant changes in 75 cardiac proteins due to fructose feeding including mitochondria-, apoptosis-, and oxidative stress-related proteins. Nevertheless, just very weak or no signs of apoptosis induction and oxidative stress were detected in the hearts of fructose-fed rats. Our results suggest that fructose feeding induces marked alterations in the cardiac lipidome, especially in cardiolipin remodeling, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cardiac function. However, at the same time, several adaptive responses are induced at the proteome level in order to maintain a homeostatic balance. These findings demonstrate that even very early stages of prediabetes can impair cardiac function and can result in significant changes in the lipidome and proteome of the heart prior to the development of excessive oxidative stress and cell damage.", "journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "date": "2019-12-31", "authors": ["Gerg\u0151Sz\u0171cs", "AndreaS\u00f3ja", "M\u00e1riaP\u00e9ter", "M\u00e1rtaS\u00e1rk\u00f6zy", "BellaBruszel", "AndreaSiska", "ImreF\u00f6ldesi", "Zolt\u00e1nSzab\u00f3", "Tam\u00e1sJan\u00e1ky", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3V\u00edgh", "G\u00e1borBalogh", "Tam\u00e1sCsont"], "doi": "10.1155/2019/3218275\n10.1186/s12933-015-0248-6\n10.2337/dc19-S002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685628\n10.1152/ajpheart.00049.2016\n10.1007/s11154-010-9131-7\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.01.014\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.010\n10.3390/ijms140611963\n10.3945/ajcn.114.086314\n10.1152/ajpregu.00392.2009\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2009.04.019\n10.3389/fcell.2017.00090\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.08.001\n10.1016/S1674-8301(10)60003-6\n10.1074/jbc.M116.769182\n10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.10.007\n10.1002/ajmg.a.20660\n10.1016/S0163-7827(00)00005-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.00379.2012\n10.1038/s41598-018-37690-5\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.07.010\n10.3390/molecules22030433\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.06.006\n10.1152/ajpheart.00817.2001\n10.1016/s0014-2999(03)02117-4\n10.1016/S0008-6363(03)00330-4\n10.1038/s41598-017-15821-8\n10.1038/s41467-018-07454-w\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1186/1475-2840-12-16\n10.1186/s12933-016-0424-3\n10.1016/j.diabres.2011.07.015\n10.1007/s00125-009-1588-0\n10.1073/pnas.1530509100\n10.1038/nprot.2011.319\n10.1161/01.RES.0000266449.37396.1f\n10.1016/j.carpath.2006.09.001\n10.4162/nrp.2015.9.4.350\n10.3945/jn.114.205583\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074212\n10.1016/j.jhep.2010.11.005\n10.1152/ajpendo.00419.2012\n10.1038/nrendo.2012.258\n10.1186/s12986-018-0272-0\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.11.003\n10.1007/s10620-016-4054-0\n10.1002/hep.25932\n10.1111/j.1463-1326.2007.00803.x\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.07.111\n10.1073/pnas.0607700103\n10.1172/JCI119776\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.252619\n10.1016/j.lfs.2019.02.017\n10.1373/clinchem.2007.095711\n10.1021/bi051908a\n10.1021/bi7004015\n10.14814/phy2.13388\n10.1194/jlr.D500044-JLR200\n10.1007/s11010-006-2215-8\n10.1194/jlr.M034728\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2006.10.018\n10.2337/dbi18-0018\n10.1074/jbc.M313662200\n10.1021/bi047773a\n10.1152/ajpendo.90761.2008\n10.1042/bj3460403\n10.1038/srep17290\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.01.013\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.08.006\n10.1021/pr060571b\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004044\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.09.022\n10.18632/oncotarget.21887\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.05.009\n10.1007/s00204-013-1148-8\n10.1074/jbc.M109.077925\n10.1007/s10517-016-3237-1\n10.1111/sms.13079\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2008.02.007\n10.1186/s12944-018-0872-8\n10.1038/nchembio.467\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.12.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098044\n10.1007/s12192-014-0493-8\n10.1016/S2213-8587(17)30307-8\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002094\n10.3109/13813455.2013.868002\n10.1007/s11745-016-4229-7\n10.1152/ajpcell.00243.2006\n10.1016/j.plefa.2018.05.003\n10.1007/s10545-012-9486-x\n10.1016/j.mito.2018.04.004"}

{"title": "Mutations in PDLIM5 are rare in dilated cardiomyopathy but are emerging as potential disease modifiers.", "abstract": "A causal genetic mutation is found in 40% of families with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), leaving a large percentage of families genetically unsolved. This prevents adequate counseling and clear recommendations in these families. We aim to identify novel genes or modifiers associated with DCM.\nWe performed computational ranking of human genes based on coexpression with a predefined set of genes known to be associated with DCM, which allowed us to prioritize gene candidates for their likelihood of being involved in DCM. Top candidates will be checked for variants in the available whole-exome sequencing data of 142 DCM patients. RNA was isolated from cardiac biopsies to investigate gene expression.\nPDLIM5 was classified as the top candidate. An interesting heterozygous variant (189_190delinsGG) was found in a DCM patient with a known pathogenic truncating TTN-variant. The PDLIM5 loss-of-function (LoF) variant affected all cardiac-specific isoforms of PDLIM5 and no LoF variants were detected in the same region in a control cohort of 26,000 individuals. RNA expression of PDLIM5 and its direct interactors (MYOT, LDB3, and MYOZ2) was increased in cardiac tissue of this patient, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism. The PDLIM5 variant cosegregated with the TTN-variant and the phenotype, leading to a high disease penetrance in this family. A second patient was an infant with a homozygous 10\u00a0kb-deletion of exon 2 in PDLIM5 resulting in early-onset cardiac disease, showing the importance of PDLIM5 in cardiac function.\nHeterozygous PDLIM5 variants are rare and therefore will not have a major contribution in DCM. Although they likely play a role in disease development as this gene plays a major role in contracting cardiomyocytes and homozygous variants lead to early-onset cardiac disease.

The aim of this study is to explore whether the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase gene is associated with the protective effect of exercise preconditioning. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J (n = 40) and GCN2 knockout (KO) (n = 40) mice were divided into four groups: control, LPS (L), exercise preconditioning (E), and exercise preconditioning LPS (EL). Mice in the exercise groups performed exercise for eight weeks. After exercise, all mice were given an equal volume of LPS or saline (10 \u03bcg/g). We measured the cardiac function using echocardiography and then collected heart tissue. Exercise preconditioning improved cardiac inflammation (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) and cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction, fraction shortening) in C57 mice induced by LPS and also decreased the expression levels of GCN2, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Moreover, GCN2 KO decreased inflammation and cardiac dysfunction induced by LPS in sedentary mice. The inflammation and cardiac dysfunction in the GCN2 KO EL group were lower than in the C57 EL group, and the expression of GCN2, p-eIF2\u03b1, and ATF4 in the GCN2 KO EL group was lower than in the C57 EL group. Exercise preconditioning alleviated cardiac injury induced by LPS. GCN2 KO also improved cardiac injury. Exercise preconditioning promoted the effect of GCN2 KO in alleviating cardiac injury, and the GCN2 and eIF2\u03b1/ATF4 pathways play an important role in the process.", "journal": "International heart journal", "date": "2019-12-26", "authors": ["Zhong-GuangSun", "GuoLu", "Lin-LinZhao", "Li-ZhenZhang", "AiLi", "JingJing", "XinXu"], "doi": "10.1536/ihj.19-307"}

After single salvianolic acids and Chuanxiong-extract or combined intravenous infusion was given to rats,plasma samples and heart tissues in different time were collected. The chromatographic separation was performed on a BEH C18 column using 0. 15% formic acid-acetonitrile as mobile phase for gradient elution. A triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry equipped with an electrospray ionization source was used as detector operating on multiple-reaction monitoring( MRM) scanning in negative ionization mode. Full validation of UPLC method including calibration curves,accuracy,precision,repeatability and matrix effect was investigated to comply with quantitative analysis requirements for biological samples. There were significant differences in the major pharmacokinetic parameters of Sal B,FA and RA for intravenous infusion of salvianolic acids and Chuanxiong-extract or combined in rat plasma.

We here demonstrate that multiple administration of EVs from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC-EVs) in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive model can protect renal tissue by maintaining its filtration capacity. Indeed, ASC-EVs downregulated the pro-inflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattracting protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activating inhibitor-1 (PAI1) and reduced recruitment of macrophages in the kidney. Moreover, ASC-EVs prevented cardiac tissue fibrosis and maintained blood pressure within normal levels, thus demonstrating their multiple favorable effects in different organs. By applying microRNA (miRNA) microarray profile of the kidney of DOCA-salt rats, we identified a selective miRNA signature associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). One of the key pathways found was the axis miR-200-TGF-\u03b2, that was significantly altered by EV administration, thereby affecting the EMT signaling and preventing renal inflammatory response and fibrosis development. Our results indicate that EVs can be a potent therapeutic tool for the treatment of hypertension-induced CKD in cardio-renal syndrome.", "journal": "Molecular therapy.

{"title": "Transcriptional sex and regional differences in paired human atrial and ventricular cardiac biopsies collected in vivo.", "abstract": "Transcriptional studies of the human heart provide insight into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of normal cardiac function and how they are altered by disease. To improve the understanding of why men and women may respond differently to the same therapeutic treatment it is crucial to learn more about sex-specific transcriptional differences. In this study the transcriptome of right atrium and left ventricle was compared across sex and regional location. Paired biopsies from five male and five female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting were included. Gene expression analysis identified 620 differentially expressed transcripts in atrial and ventricular tissue in men and 471 differentially expressed transcripts in women. In total 339 of these transcripts overlapped across sex but notably, 281 were unique in the male tissue and 162 in the female tissue, displaying marked sex differences in the transcriptional machinery. The transcriptional activity was significantly higher in atrias than in ventricles as 70% of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the atrial tissue. Furthermore, pathway- and functional annotation analyses performed on the differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for a more heterogeneous composition of biological processes in atrial compared with the ventricular tissue, and a dominance of differentially expressed genes associated with infection disease was observed. The results reported here provide increased insights about transcriptional differences between the cardiac atrium and ventricle but also reveal transcriptional differences in the human heart that can be attributed to sex.", "journal": "Physiological genomics", "date": "2019-12-24", "authors": ["JaneSynnergren", "KristinaVukusic", "PierreD\u00f6nnes", "MarianneJonsson", "AndersLindahl", "G\u00f6ranDellgren", "AndersJeppsson", "JuliaAsp"], "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00036.2019"}

{"title": "Atorvastatin protects cardiomyocyte from doxorubicin toxicity by modulating survivin expression through FOXO1 inhibition.", "abstract": "Survivin has an anti-apoptotic effect against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Clinically, statin use is associated with a lower risk for heart failure in breast cancer patients with anthracycline chemotherapy. So, the purpose of our study was to investigate whether survivin mediates the protective effect of statin against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.\nMice were treated once a week with 5\u00a0mg/kg doxorubicin for 4\u00a0weeks with or without atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg/kg every day then heart tissues were analyzed. Molecular and cellular biology analyses were performed with H9c2 cell lysates.\nDoxorubicin suppressed survivin expression via activation of FOXO1 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Whereas, atorvastatin inhibited FOXO1 by increasing phosphorylation and inhibiting nuclear localization. Doxorubicin induced FOXO1 binding to STAT3 and prevented STAT3 from interacting with Sp1. However, atorvastatin inhibited these interactions and stabilized STAT3/Sp1 transcription complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that doxorubicin decreased STAT3/Sp1 complex binding to survivin promoter, whereas atorvastatin stabilized this binding. In mouse model, atorvastatin rescued doxorubicin-induced reduction of survivin expression and of heart function measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.\nOur study suggested a new pathophysiologic mechanism that survivin mediated protective effect of atorvastatin against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via FOXO1/STAT3/Sp1 transcriptional network.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2019-12-24", "authors": ["JaewonOh", "Beom SeobLee", "GibbeumLim", "HeejungLim", "Chan JooLee", "SunghaPark", "Sang-HakLee", "Ji HyungChung", "Seok-MinKang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.12.007"}
{"title": "Dissection of heterocellular cross-talk in vascularized cardiac tissue mimetics.", "abstract": "Cellular specialization and interaction with other cell types in cardiac tissue is essential for the coordinated function of cell populations in the heart. The complex interplay between cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts is necessary for adaptation but can also lead to pathophysiological remodeling. To understand this complex interplay, we developed 3D vascularized cardiac tissue mimetics (CTM) to study heterocellular cross-talk in hypertrophic, hypoxic and fibrogenic environments. This 3D platform responds to physiologic and pathologic stressors and mimics the microenvironment of diseased tissue. In combination with endothelial cell fluorescence reporters, these cardiac tissue mimetics can be used to precisely visualize and quantify cellular and functional responses upon stress stimulation. Utilizing this platform, we demonstrate that stimulation of \u03b1/\u03b2-adrenergic receptors with phenylephrine (PE) promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, metabolic maturation and vascularization of CTMs. Increased vascularization was promoted by conditioned medium of PE-stimulated cardiomyocytes and blocked by inhibiting VEGF or upon \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist treatment, demonstrating cardiomyocyte-endothelial cross-talk. Pathophysiological stressors such as severe hypoxia reduced angiogenic sprouting and increased cell death, while TGF \u03b22 stimulation increased collagen deposition concomitant to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Biochanin A (BCA) is a main constituent of Trifolium pratense L. This study was intended to explore the effect of BCA on Ml/R injury and explore the potential mechanism.\nIn vivo MI/R injury was established by transient coronary ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (TTC) was used to measure myocardial infarct size. ELISA assay was employed to evaluate the levels of myocardial enzyme and inflammatory cytokines. Western blot assay was conducted to detect related protein levels in myocardial tissues.\nBCA significantly ameliorated myocardial infarction area, reduced the release of myocardial enzyme levels including aspartate transaminase (AST), creatine kinase (CK-MB) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). It also decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) in serum of Ml/R rats.

{"title": "Bisphenol A-induced oxidative damage in the hepatic and cardiac tissues of rats: The modulatory role of sesame lignans.", "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental pollutant that is widely produced throughout the world. It is primarily used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, paints and dental materials. BPA has been reported to promote hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. The antioxidant activity of sesame lignans is well established. The current study assessed the protective efficiency of sesame lignans against BPA-induced hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Rats were divided into 4 groups: A control group, a BPA-treated group, a sesame lignans-treated group and a sesame lignans and BPA-treated group. Rats were orally administered their respective doses daily [30 mg/kg body weight (BW) BPA and/or 20 mg/kg BW sesame lignans] for 6 weeks. Liver function tests were performed using serum of all groups. Lipid profile and antioxidant status were also measured in liver tissue of the studied groups. The results were confirmed by histopathological examination of liver and heart tissues. The oral administration of BPA was revealed to elicit significant decreases in the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione. It also significantly increased levels of malondialdehyde. Furthermore, BPA-treatment resulted in lipid accumulation, elevated activities of alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase MB and lactate dehydrogenase, and histological changes of liver and heart tissues. However, the co-administration of sesame lignans and BPA attenuated hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and BPA-induced histological changes. The results of the current study indicated that sesame lignans may be helpful in the development of novel natural drugs to treat hepatic and cardiovascular disorders.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2019-12-20", "authors": ["Saber MEweda", "Al Sayeda ANewairy", "Heba MAbdou", "Assmaa SGaber"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2019.8193\n10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.07.010\n10.1016/j.tox.2006.06.009\n10.1590/S1413-81232012000200015\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.09.058\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.088\n10.1155/2012/194829\n10.1016/j.envres.2016.02.026\n10.1038/srep21982\n10.1016/j.microc.2018.04.011\n10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.07.028\n10.1097/01.shk.0000232274.88354.8d\n10.1016/j.cccn.2004.12.009\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.05.006\n10.1002/jsfa.7035\n10.1016/j.bioorg.2013.06.009\n10.1080/87559120903564464\n10.1021/jf2040687\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.07.016\n10.1016/j.cofs.2016.02.002\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.12.010\n10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.11.047\n10.1016/j.toxrep.2014.04.003\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.09.031\n10.1016/0003-2697(79)90738-3\n10.1016/0003-2697(80)90139-6\n10.1016/0003-2697(88)90564-7\n10.1111/j.1432-1033.1974.tb03714.x\n10.1016/j.tiv.2017.02.018\n10.3923/pjbs.2014.1152.1160\n10.3109/10715762.2010.498477\n10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.092\n10.1016/j.achaem.2017.08.005\n10.1016/j.fct.2017.12.021\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2017.05.001\n10.1002/hep.24685\n10.1016/j.tox.2014.08.006\n10.1016/j.tox.2012.09.013\n10.1016/j.fct.2010.07.019\n10.1016/j.jpba.2017.02.058\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2013.10.013\n10.1016/j.tox.2016.02.007\n10.1007/s10616-013-9672-1\n10.1155/2014/259763\n10.12816/0000829\n10.1016/j.fct.2013.11.017\n10.1016/j.fct.2010.05.055\n10.1155/2013/365892\n10.1016/j.jff.2017.08.036\n10.1007/s00394-006-0617-8\n10.1016/S0955-2863(01)00224-8\n10.6090/jarq.37.151\n10.1016/j.lfs.2015.02.008\n10.1016/S0952-3278(98)90112-0\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03224.x\n10.1590/S0102-695X2012005000027\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00024\n10.1016/S2221-1691(12)60162-2\n10.1039/C2FO30220A"}

Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to control, ISO, and ISO + ghrelin groups. ISO (2 mg/kg per day, subcutaneous) or vehicle was administered once daily for 7 days, then ghrelin (100 microg/kg per day, subcutaneous) was administered once daily for the next 3 weeks. Ghrelin treatment greatly improved the cardiac function of ISO-treated rats. Ghrelin also decreased plasma brain natriuretic peptide level and ratios of heart weight to body weight and left ventricular weight to body weight. Ghrelin significantly reduced myocardial collagen area and hydroxyproline content, accompanied by decreased mRNA levels of collagen type I and III. Furthermore, ghrelin increased plasma level of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and GDF15 mRNA and protein levels in heart tissues, which were significantly decreased with ISO alone. The phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and GSK-3beta at Ser9 was decreased with ISO, and ghrelin significantly reversed the downregulation of p-Akt and p-GSK-3beta. Mediated by GDF15, ghrelin could attenuate ISO-induced myocardial fibrosis via Akt-GSK-3beta signaling.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2019-12-20", "authors": ["QRen", "PLin", "QWang", "BZhang", "LFeng"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.934183\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.928846\n10.1083/jcb.200207165\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.01.019\n10.1530/JOE-13-0045\n10.1007/s00395-018-0671-4\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.02.021\n10.1159/000452571\n10.1002/jcp.22102\n10.1161/01.RES.0000202805.73038.48\n10.1016/j.hfc.2009.04.006\n10.1038/nm.2354\n10.1016/j.peptides.2012.02.025\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000001736\n10.1016/j.phrs.2017.08.016\n10.1097/CRD.0000000000000113\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2011.04.003\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfs120\n10.1161/01.hyp.0000122803.91559.55\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04864\n10.3390/ijms160921911\n10.1016/j.bcp.2015.10.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031635\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000149746.62908.BB\n10.1016/j.lfs.2017.10.034\n10.1152/ajpendo.00123.2013\n10.1172/JCI29576\n10.33549/physiolres.933761\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfs130\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60894-5\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312130\n10.1210/EN.2015-1333\n10.1152/ajpheart.00643.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311045\n10.1016/j.juro.2014.11.098\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.06.049\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.06161\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.10094\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv365\n10.2174/1381612822666151119144458\n10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.004\n10.1016/j.peptides.2017.01.013\n10.1111/1440-1681.12948\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01538.x\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfs158\n10.1152/ajpheart.00257.2011\n10.1074/jbc.M113.516278\n10.1016/j.peptides.2017.10.018\n10.1111/bph.13133\n10.1177/1479164117698917\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.052399"}
{"title": "The Art of Intercellular Wireless Communications: Exosomes in Heart Disease and Therapy.", "abstract": "Exosomes are nanoscale membrane-bound extracellular vesicles secreted by most eukaryotic cells in the body that facilitates intercellular communication. Exosomes carry several signaling biomolecules, including miRNA, proteins, enzymes, cell surface receptors, growth factors, cytokines and lipids that can modulate target cell biology and function. Due to these capabilities, exosomes have emerged as novel intercellular signaling mediators in both homeostasis and pathophysiological conditions. Recent studies document that exosomes (both circulating or released from heart tissue) have been actively involved in cardiac remodeling in response to stressors. Also, exosomes released from progenitor/stem cells have protective effects in heart diseases and shown to have regenerative potential in the heart. In this review we discuss- the critical role played by circulating exosomes released from various tissues and from cells within the heart in cardiac health; the gap in knowledge that needs to be addressed to promote future research; and exploitation of recent advances in exosome engineering to develop novel therapy.", "journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "date": "2019-12-19", "authors": ["MallikarjunPatil", "JohnHenderson", "HienLuong", "DivyaAnnamalai", "GopalkrishnaSreejit", "PrasannaKrishnamurthy"], "doi": "10.3389/fcell.2019.00315\n10.1172/jci.insight.93344\n10.1055/s-0030-1267044\n10.3389/fphys.2018.01169\n10.3390/pharmaceutics10040218\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.052126\n10.1021/acsnano.6b07607\n10.1186/cc6176\n10.1160/TH13-11-0977\n10.1172/JCI70577\n10.1186/s12967-019-1980-6\n10.1093/cvr/cvy055\n10.1093/cvr/cvu167\n10.1002/pmic.201800247\n10.1007/978-981-10-4397-0_5\n10.3390/cells8020166\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.12.022\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659\n10.4049/jimmunol.168.7.3235\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.03.007\n10.15252/emmm.201606924\n10.1097/JTO.0b013e318299ac32\n10.1111/jcmm.12589\n10.1038/s41467-019-08895-8897\n10.1074/mcp.M115.055731\n10.1111/jcmm.12529\n10.1038/nature08195\n10.3390/ijms17081322\n10.1038/s41598-018-26411-26417\n10.1128/MCB.00611-616\n10.1111/jcmm.13302\n10.1038/s41598-018-34357-z\n10.3402/jev.v1i0.18396\n10.1007/s12265-016-9705-9701\n10.1001/jama.298.7.765\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.04.030\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2015.08.010\n10.1172/jci.insight.89908\n10.3791/58814\n10.1002/stem.1571\n10.1111/jcmm.12436\n10.1002/jcp.20197\n10.1093/bja/aeh163\n10.3389/fimmu.2019.01560\n10.1111/jcmm.12923\n10.1067/s0002-9378(03)00469-461\n10.1186/1471-2164-13-357\n10.1016/j.apsb.2016.02.001\n10.1172/JCI64365\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2018.09.015\n10.1016/0006-291X(83)91776-X\n10.1083/jcb.201212113\n10.1038/ncb2441\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.044164\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.08.026\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.04.006\n10.1097/01.ccm.0000114829.17746.19\n10.1161/JAHA.114.001249\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586\n10.1007/s10616-016-9952-9957\n10.1089/ars.2016.6844\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.01.231\n10.1210/jc.2012-1996\n10.1016/j.healun.2017.07.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305990\n10.1016/j.nano.2015.10.012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.209643\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-421\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307654\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958975\n10.1152/ajpcell.00166.2006\n10.3892/ijmm.2018.3699\n10.1063/1.5087122\n10.1038/s41419-019-1910-1919\n10.2147/IJN.S154458\n10.7150/thno.30853\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.028\n10.3390/cancers10100370\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311326\n10.1038/aps.2017.12\n10.4049/jimmunol.1101988\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.10.022\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00117.x\n10.1155/2013/653789\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301209\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312420\n10.1038/s41598-019-46407-46401\n10.1007/s10741-012-9313-9313\n10.1093/cvr/cvz108\n10.1038/s41419-018-0274-x\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000000928\n10.1016/j.omtn.2018.05.013\n10.1001/jamacardio.2018.3539\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.05.022\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.007917\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.05.134\n10.1016/0092-8674(83)90040-90045\n10.1080/20013078.2018.1522236\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.015687\n10.1182/blood-2008-04-153536\n10.1021/acsnano.5b06939\n10.1172/JCI123135\n10.7150/thno.23453\n10.7150/ijbs.7502\n10.1128/IAI.01089-1089\n10.1084/jem.183.3.1161\n10.1093/cvr/cvx118\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aau1168\n10.2337/dbi16-0041\n10.2174/1874192401004010302\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.09.118\n10.4049/jimmunol.170.6.3037\n10.1021/bc500291r\n10.1161/01.cir.88.4.1931\n10.1007/s12265-018-9826-9829\n10.1038/srep36207\n10.1007/s12265-018-9825-x\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2008.04.033\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000002328\n10.1152/ajpheart.00602.2017\n10.1182/blood-2013-02-478925\n10.1056/nejm199007053230106\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.026\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2014.04.009\n10.1016/j.ymthe.2016.09.001\n10.2337/db15-1563\n10.1038/srep13721\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.001\n10.1016/j.devcel.2019.04.011\n10.1159/000489383\n10.1161/JAHA.117.007442\n10.1172/JCI81129\n10.1038/ncomms12277\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.08.035\n10.1089/ten.tea.2017.0084\n10.1038/s41598-017-09763-9764\n10.1016/j.tcm.2018.10.010\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.226357\n10.1073/pnas.1721521115\n10.1016/j.gpb.2015.02.001\n10.2337/db17-0356\n10.1038/nm0598-594\n10.1002/advs.201801313"}

Various in vitro methods have been developed to improve the accuracy in the result of drug-induced cardiac toxicity screening. Herein, we propose a novel SU-8 cantilever integrated with an electromechanical-stimulator to enhance the maturation of cultured cardiac cells. The simultaneous electromechanical stimulation significantly enhances the contraction force of the cardiomyocytes, thereby increasing cantilever displacement. Fluorescence microscopy analysis was performed to confirm the improved maturation of the cardiomyocytes. After the initial experiments, the contractile behaviors of the cultured cardiomyocytes were investigated by measuring the mechanical deformation of the SU-8 cantilever. Finally, the proposed electromechanical-stimulator-integrated SU-8 cantilever was used to evaluate the adverse effects of different cardiac vascular drugs, i.e., verapamil, lidocaine, and isoproterenol, on the cultured cardiomyocytes. The physiology of the cardiac-drug-treated cardiomyocytes was examined with and without electrical stimulation of the cardiomyocytes.

We previously demonstrated that canstatin inhibits isoproterenol (ISO)-induced dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)c4, which plays an important role in cardiac hypertrophy, in differentiated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Thus, we investigated whether in vivo canstatin administration prevents ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy through the inhibition of NFATc4 pathway. Rats were subcutaneously injected with ISO (5\u00a0mg/kg) or saline (Cont) for 7 days. Simultaneously, recombinant mouse canstatin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered. After left ventricular wall thickness and cardiac function were measured by echocardiography, the hearts were isolated and left ventricular weight (LVW) was weighed.

{"title": "RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling of cardiac tissue implicates novel putative disease mechanisms in FLNC-associated arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) encompasses a group of inherited cardiomyopathies including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) whose molecular disease mechanism is associated with dysregulation of the canonical WNT signalling pathway. Recent evidence indicates that ARVC and ACM caused by pathogenic variants in the FLNC gene encoding filamin C, a major cardiac structural protein, may have different molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. We sought to identify dysregulated biological pathways in FLNC-associated ACM. RNA was extracted from seven paraffin-embedded left ventricular tissue samples from deceased ACM patients carrying FLNC variants and sequenced. Transcript levels of 623 genes were upregulated and 486 genes were reduced in ACM in comparison to control samples. The cell adhesion pathway and ILK signalling were among the prominent dysregulated pathways in ACM. Consistent with these findings, transcript levels of cell adhesion genes JAM2, NEO1, VCAM1 and PTPRC were upregulated in ACM samples. Moreover, several actin-associated genes, including FLNC, VCL, PARVB and MYL7, were suppressed, suggesting dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Analysis of the transcriptome for dysregulated biological pathways predicted activation of inflammation and apoptosis and suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and MTORC1 signalling in ACM. Our data suggests dysregulated cell adhesion and ILK signalling as novel putative pathogenic mechanisms of ACM caused by FLNC variants which are distinct from the postulated disease mechanism of classic ARVC caused by desmosomal gene mutations. This knowledge could help in the design of future gene therapy strategies which would target specific components of these pathways and potentially lead to novel treatments for ACM.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2019-12-18", "authors": ["Charlotte LHall", "PriyatanshGurha", "MariaSabater-Molina", "AngelikiAsimaki", "MartaFutema", "Ruth CLovering", "Mari PazSu\u00e1rez", "BeatrizAguilera", "PilarMolina", "EstherZorio", "CristianCoarfa", "Matthew JRobertson", "Sirisha MCheedipudi", "Keat-EngNg", "PaulDelaney", "Juan PedroHern\u00e1ndez", "FranciscoPastor", "Juan RGimeno", "William JMcKenna", "Ali JMarian", "PetrosSyrris"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.12.002\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.09.048"}

The current study was designed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of FUC against microcystin-LR (MC-LR)-induced toxicity. Five mice groups (n\u2009=\u20098) were used. Group 1 received saline, Group 2 received oral FUC 100\u00a0mg/kg/day for 21\u00a0days, Group 3 received i.p.

Fisetin (FIS), as a natural flavonoid, has potential activities to alleviate obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of FIS against HFD-induced cardiac injury remain unclear. The present study was to explore the protective effects of FIS on cardiac dysfunction in HFD-fed mice. We found that FIS alleviated HFD-triggered metabolic disorder by reducing body weight, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and insulin resistance. Moreover, FIS supplements significantly alleviated dyslipidemia in both mouse hearts and cardiomyocytes stimulated by metabolic stress. FIS treatment abolished HFD-induced inflammatory response in heart tissues through suppressing TNF receptor-1/TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (Tnfr-1/Traf-2) signaling. Furthermore, FIS induced a strong reduction in the expression of fibrosis-related genes, contributing to the inhibition of fibrosis by inactivating transforming growth factor (Tgf)-\u03b21/Smads/Erk1/2 signaling.

{"title": "Unravelling the ultrastructural details of \u03b1T-catenin-deficient cell-cell contacts between heart muscle cells by the use of FIB-SEM.", "abstract": "The intercalated disc is an important structure in cardiomyocytes, as it is essential to maintain correct contraction and proper functioning of the heart. Adhesion and communication between cardiomyocytes are mediated by three main types of intercellular junctions, all residing in the intercalated disc: gap junctions, desmosomes and the areae compositae. Mutations in genes that encode junctional proteins, including \u03b1T-catenin (encoded by CTNNA3), have been linked to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death. In mice, the loss of \u03b1T-catenin in cardiomyocytes leads to impaired heart function, fibrosis, changed expression of desmosomal proteins and increased risk for arrhythmias following ischemia-reperfusion. Currently, it is unclear how the intercalated disc and the intercellular junctions are organised in 3D in the hearts of this \u03b1T-catenin knockout (KO) mouse model. In order to scrutinise this, ventricular cardiac tissue of \u03b1T-catenin KO mice was used for volume electron microscopy (VEM), making use of Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), allowing a careful 3D reconstruction of the intercalated disc, including gap junctions and desmosomes. Although \u03b1T-catenin KO and control mice display a comparable organisation of the sarcomere and the different intercalated disc regions, the folds of the plicae region of the intercalated disc are longer and more narrow in the KO heart, and the pale region between the sarcomere and the intercalated disc is larger. In addition, \u03b1T-catenin KO intercalated discs appear to have smaller gap junctions and desmosomes in the plicae region, while gap junctions are larger in the interplicae region of the intercalated disc. Although the reason for this remodelling of the ultrastructure after \u03b1T-catenin deletion remains unclear, the excellent resolution of the FIB-SEM technology allows us to reconstruct details that were not reported before. LAY DESCRIPTION: Cardiomyocytes are cells that make up the heart muscle. As the chief cell type of the heart, cardiomyocytes are primarily involved in the contractile function of the heart that enables the pumping of blood around the body. Cardiac muscle cells are connected to each other at their short end by numerous intercellular junctions forming together a structure called the intercalated disc. These intercellular junctions comprise specific protein complexes, which are crucial for both intercellular adhesion and correct contraction of the heart. Imaging by conventional electron microscopy (EM) revealed a heavily folded intercalated disc with apparently random organization of the intercellular junctions. However, this conclusion was based on analysis in two dimensions (2D). 3D information of these structures is needed to unravel their true organization and function. In the present study, we used a more contemporary technique, called volume EM, to image and reconstruct the intercalated discs in 3D. By this approach, EM images are made from a whole block of tissue what differs significantly from classical EM methods that uses only one very thin slice for imaging. Further, we analyzed in comparison to normal mice also a mouse model for cardiomyopathy in which a specific protein of the cardiac intercellular junctions, \u03b1T-catenin, is absent. Volume EM revealed that in the hearts of these mice with cardiomyopathy, the finger-like folds of the intercalated disc are longer and thinner compared to control hearts. Also the intercellular junctions on the folded parts of the intercalated disc are smaller and their connection to the striated cytoskeleton seems further away. In conclusion, our volume EM study has expanded our understanding of 3D structures at the intercalated discs and will pave the way for more detailed models of disturbed cell-cell contacts associated with heart failure.", "journal": "Journal of microscopy", "date": "2019-12-13", "authors": ["BVanslembrouck", "AKremer", "FVAN Roy", "SLippens", "JVAN Hengel"], "doi": "10.1111/jmi.12855"}

Among the reasons that lead to this disease, we may include infections caused by a virus, bacteria, protozoa, fungus, and others. One of the signs of the inflammation is the formation of edema, which may be a consequence of the interaction between interstitial fluid dynamics and immune response. This complex physiological process was mathematically modeled using a nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDE) based on porous media approach. By combing a model based on Biot's poroelasticity theory with a model for the immune response we developed a new hydro-mechanical model for inflammatory edema. To verify this new computational model, T2 parametric mapping obtained by Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging was used to identify the region of edema in a patient diagnosed with unspecific myocarditis.\nA patient-specific geometrical model was created using MRI images from the patient with myocarditis. With this model, edema formation was simulated using the proposed hydro-mechanical mathematical model in a two-dimensional domain. The computer simulations allowed us to correlate spatiotemporal dynamics of representative cells of the immune systems, such as leucocytes and the pathogen, with fluid accumulation and cardiac tissue deformation.\nThis study demonstrates that the proposed mathematical model is a very promising tool to better understand edema formation in myocarditis.

We examined whether ticagrelor can affect the number of progenitor cells in the border zone. Ticagrelor, started 24h after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, attenuates the decrease in heart function and adverse remodeling, an effect which is blocked by aspirin.\nRats underwent 40min ischemia followed by reperfusion. Oral dosing with vehicle, ticagrelor (300mg/kg/d), aspirin (20mg/kg/d), their combination or prasugrel (15mg/kg/d) started 7days after infarction. Echocardiography was used to assess systolic function. Heart tissue were analyzed by rt-PCR, immunoblotting, ELISA and immunohistochemistry 2weeks after infarction.\nBoth ticagrelor and aspirin attenuated the decrease in systolic function and remodeling, an effect that was blocked by their combination. Ticagrelor and aspirin attenuated the increase in ANP, BNP, collagen-I and collagen-III. Again, the effect was blocked by their combination. Ticagrelor increased c-Kit, Sca-1, Ki-67, CD34, attenuated the decrease in CD105 mRNA levels, and attenuated the increase in CD31, whereas aspirin increased Ki-67, suppressed the increase in CD31 and attenuated the decrease in CD105 mRNA levels.

{"title": "Coronary artery plaque growth: A two-way coupled shear stress-driven model.", "abstract": "Atherosclerosis in coronary arteries can lead to plaque growth, stenosis formation, and blockage of the blood flow supplying the heart tissue. Several studies have shown that hemodynamics play an important role in the growth of coronary artery plaques. Specifically, low wall shear stress (WSS) appears to be the leading hemodynamic parameter promoting atherosclerotic plaque growth, which in turn influences the blood flow and WSS distribution. Therefore, a two-way coupled interaction exists between WSS and atherosclerosis growth. In this work, a computational framework was developed to study the coupling between WSS and plaque growth in coronary arteries. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to quantify WSS distribution. Surface mesh nodes were moved in the inward normal direction according to a growth model based on WSS. After each growth stage, the geometry was updated and the CFD simulation repeated to find updated WSS values for the next growth stage. One hundred twenty growth stages were simulated in an idealized tube and an image-based left anterior descending artery. An automated framework was developed using open-source software to couple CFD simulations with growth. Changes in plaque morphology and hemodynamic patterns during different growth stages are presented. The results show larger plaque growth towards the downstream segment of the plaque, agreeing with the reported clinical observations. The developed framework could be used to establish hemodynamic-driven growth models and study the interaction between these processes.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2019-12-11", "authors": ["AmirhosseinArzani"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.3293"}
{"title": "MiR-338-5p ameliorates pathological cardiac hypertrophy by targeting CAMKII\u03b4.", "abstract": "Pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH) is characterized by an increase in cardiomyocyte size and thickening of the ventricular walls during the adaptive response to maintain cardiac function, which often progresses to a maladaptive response and, ultimately, to heart failure. Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play roles in the pathogenesis of PCH. In this study, we first found that the regulation of miR-338-5p was aberrant in cardiac tissues of heart failure patients and transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced PCH mice. Overexpression of miR-338-5p in the heart using recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) ameliorated TAC-induced PCH, as indicated by a decreased heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio. Furthermore, miR-338-5p mitigated the TAC-induced damage in heart contraction and relaxation function, as measured by echocardiography and a cardio hemodynamic measurement, respectively. We also identified CAMKII\u03b4 as a direct target of miR-338-5p using bioinformatics tools and the luciferase reporter assay. Finally, we observed that the miR-338-5p-mediated downregulation of CAMKII\u03b4 reversed the cell surface area enlargement induced by the Ang-II treatment in H9c2 cells. Therefore, we highlight a novel molecular mechanism of the miR-338-5p/CAMKII\u03b4 axis that contributes to the pathogenesis of PCH.", "journal": "Archives of pharmacal research", "date": "2019-12-11", "authors": ["KailongLi", "YuedongLin", "CongLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s12272-019-01199-w"}

Here, we analyzed the link between ANT1 expression and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)-mediated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, which represents a novel communication pathway between mitochondria and the extracellular environment. The interaction between ANT1 and HSP27 was identified by co-immunoprecipitation from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. ANT1 transgenic (ANT1-TG) cardiomyocytes demonstrated elevated HSP27 expression levels. Increased levels of HSP27 were released from the ANT1-TG cardiomyocytes under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Extracellular HSP27 stimulated TLR4 signaling via protein kinase B (AKT). The HSP27-mediated activation of the TLR4 pathway was more pronounced in ANT1-TG cardiomyocytes than in wild-type (WT) cardiomyocytes. HSP27-specific antibodies inhibited TLR4 activation and the expression of HSP27.

In the rat plasma, ELISA was used to assay the levels of coagulation and plasmin system indicators, including platelet activating factor, endothelin, tissue factor (TF), plasminogen inhibitor, thromboxane B2, plasma fibrinogen.\nThe results showed that SXNI can reduce the infarct size of myocardial tissue, decrease the myocardial enzyme and TnI levels and decrease the degree of myocardial damage compared with the model group. Additionally, SXNI can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reduce the MDA level and decrease the GRP78, CRT, CHOP and caspase-12 expression levels. SXNI also decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines in rat serum, lowered the level of procoagulant molecules in plasma and reduced the TLR4/NF-\u03baB expression.\nSXNI has protective effect on MIRI mainly by inhibiting oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), thereby regulating TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway to reduce inflammation, and lowing procoagulant-related factors levels to reduce the risk of thrombosis.", "journal": "Annals of translational medicine", "date": "2019-12-07", "authors": ["RuiyingWang", "MinWang", "JiahuiZhou", "TianyuanYe", "XuehengXie", "DongNi", "JingxueYe", "QiaolingHan", "CaixiaDi", "LiangGuo", "GuiboSun", "XiaoboSun"], "doi": "10.21037/atm.2019.09.40\n10.3892/mmr.2017.6616\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.255604\n10.1159/000460837\n10.1093/cvr/cvt160\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.189\n10.1590/S0100-879X2011007500119\n10.1016/j.ahj.2006.03.011\n10.1007/s11655-012-1113-z\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00312\n10.2147/DDDT.S156000\n10.1016/j.tips.2005.09.006\n10.1016/j.cbi.2017.06.011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.310266\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.12.132\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00180\n10.1038/srep21730\n10.1002/jcb.27587\n10.1016/j.intimp.2016.11.018\n10.1371/journal.pone.0108024\n10.1089/ars.2009.2695\n10.1016/j.peptides.2016.12.009\n10.1016/j.thromres.2010.11.007\n10.1254/jphs.13118FP\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00600\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045037\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000640\n10.1159/000494539\n10.2147/DDDT.S179101\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.11.004\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000070542.18001.87\n10.1111/micc.12050\n10.1007/s10753-016-0462-8\n10.1038/s41401-019-0214-z\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.07.039\n10.1073/pnas.0606956103\n10.1093/cvr/cvx086\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.188656\n10.1159/000445561\n10.3109/13880209.2011.554845\n10.1159/000355536\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2954\n10.4238/2015.May.25.9\n10.4061/2011/514623\n10.1111/jth.12472"}

However, the improvement in cardiac function in animal studies has not fully translated to humans. To help bridge the gap between species, we investigated the effects of adult human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) on contractile function of human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs) as a species-specific model of the human myocardium.\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyoctes (hCMs) were mixed with Collagen/Matrigel to fabricate control hECTs, with an experimental group of hCSC-supplemented hECT fabricated using a 9:1 ratio of hCM to hCSC. Functional testing was performed starting on culture day 6, under spontaneous conditions and also during electrical pacing from 0.25 to 1.0\u2009Hz, measurements repeated at days 8 and 10. hECTs were then frozen and processed for gene analysis using a Nanostring assay with a cardiac targeted custom panel.\nThe hCSC-supplemented hECTs displayed a twofold higher developed force vs. hCM-only controls by day 6, with approximately threefold higher developed stress and maximum rates of contraction and relaxation during pacing at 0.75\u2009Hz. The spontaneous beat rate characteristics were similar between groups, and hCSC supplementation did not adversely impact beat rate variability. The increased contractility persisted through days 8 and 10, albeit with some decrease in the magnitude of the difference of the force by day 10, but with developed stress still significantly higher in hCSC-supplemented hECT; these findings were confirmed with multiple hCSC and hCM cell lines.

{"title": "Immunomodulatory effects of interferon-\u03b3 on human fetal cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, are therapeutically used for diseases, including heart failure. As early gestational-phase embryonic tissues exhibit extraordinary regenerative potential, fetal MSCs exposed to inflammation offer a unique opportunity to evaluate molecular mechanisms underlying preferential healing, and investigate their inherent abilities to communicate with the immune system during development. The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) on the immunomodulatory effects of first-trimester human fetal cardiac (hfc)-MSCs.\nhfcMSCs (gestational week 8) were exposed to IFN\u03b3, with subsequent analysis of the whole transcriptome, based on RNA sequencing. Exploration of surface-expressed immunoregulatory mediators and modulation of T cell responses were performed by flow cytometry. Presence and activity of soluble mediators were assessed by ELISA or high-performance liquid chromatography.\nStimulation of hfcMSCs with IFN\u03b3 revealed significant transcriptional changes, particularly in respect to the expression of genes belonging to antigen presentation pathways, cell cycle control, and interferon signaling. Expression of immunomodulatory genes and associated functional changes, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, and regulation of T cell activation and proliferation via programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, were significantly upregulated. These immunoregulatory molecules diminished rapidly upon withdrawal of inflammatory stimulus, indicating a high degree of plasticity by hfcMSCs.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study performing a systematic evaluation of inflammatory responses and immunoregulatory properties of first-trimester cardiac tissue. In summary, our study demonstrates the dynamic responsiveness of hfcMSCs to inflammatory stimuli.

{"title": "A Novel Role of Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase 10A in Pathological Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), through degradation of cyclic nucleotides, play critical roles in cardiovascular biology and disease. Our preliminary screening studies have revealed PDE10A upregulation in the diseased heart. However, the roles of PDE10A in cardiovascular biology and disease are largely uncharacterized. The current study is aimed to investigate the regulation and function of PDE10A in cardiac cells and in the progression of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.\nWe used isolated adult mouse cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, as well as preclinical mouse models of hypertrophy and heart failure. The PDE10A selective inhibitor TP-10, and global PDE10A knock out mice were used.\nWe found that PDE10A expression remains relatively low in normal and exercised heart tissues. However, PDE10A is significantly upregulated in mouse and human failing hearts. In vitro, PDE10A deficiency or inhibiting PDE10A with selective inhibitor TP-10, attenuated cardiac myocyte pathological hypertrophy induced by Angiotensin II, phenylephrine, and isoproterenol, but did not affect cardiac myocyte physiological hypertrophy induced by IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). TP-10 also reduced TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2)-stimulated cardiac fibroblast activation, proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix synthesis. TP-10 treatment elevated both cAMP and cGMP levels in cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, consistent with PDE10A as a cAMP/cGMP dual-specific PDE. In vivo, global PDE10A deficiency significantly attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload via transverse aorta constriction or chronic neurohormonal stimulation via Angiotensin II infusion. Importantly, we demonstrated that the pharmacological effect of TP-10 is specifically through PDE10A inhibition. In addition, TP-10 is able to reverse pre-established cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. RNA-Sequencing and bioinformatics analysis further identified a PDE10A-regualted transcriptome involved in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiomyopathy.\nTaken together, our study elucidates a novel role for PDE10A in the regulation of pathological cardiac remodeling and development of heart failure. Given that PDE10A has been proven to be a safe drug target, PDE10A inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating cardiac diseases associated with cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2019-12-06", "authors": ["SiChen", "YishuaiZhang", "Janet KLighthouse", "Deanne MMickelsen", "JiangbinWu", "PengYao", "Eric MSmall", "ChenYan"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042178"}

Is pulmonary arterial hypertension a cancer-like disease? Does the adventitia play an important role in the initiation of pulmonary vascular remodeling? Is pulmonary arterial hypertension a systemic disease? Does capillary loss drive right ventricular failure? While pulmonary arterial hypertension does not replicate all features of cancer, anti-proliferative cancer therapeutics might still be beneficial in pulmonary arterial hypertension if monitored for safety and tolerability. It was recognized that the adventitia as a cell-rich compartment is important in the disease pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and should be a therapeutic target, albeit the data are inconclusive as to whether the adventitia is involved in the initiation of neointima formation. There was agreement that systemic diseases can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension and that pulmonary arterial hypertension can have systemic effects related to the advanced lung pathology, yet there was less agreement on whether idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a systemic disease per se. Despite acknowledging the limitations of exactly assessing vascular density in the right ventricle, it was recognized that the failing right ventricle may show inadequate vascular adaptation resulting in inadequate delivery of oxygen and other metabolites. Although the debate was not meant to result in a definite resolution of the specific arguments, it sparked ideas about how we might resolve the discrepancies by improving our disease modeling (rodent models, large-animal studies, studies of human cells, tissues, and organs) as well as standardization of the models. Novel experimental approaches, such as lineage tracing and better three-dimensional imaging of experimental as well as human lung and heart tissues, might unravel how different cells contribute to the disease pathology.", "journal": "Pulmonary circulation", "date": "2019-12-05", "authors": ["EddaSpiekerkoetter", "Elena AGoncharova", "ChristopheGuignabert", "KurtStenmark", "GrazynaKwapiszewska", "MarleneRabinovitch", "NorbertVoelkel", "Harm JBogaard", "BrianGraham", "Soni SPullamsetti", "Wolfgang MKuebler"], "doi": "10.1177/2045894019889775"}

{"title": "Cardiac Progenitor Cells from Stem Cells: Learning from Genetics and Biomaterials.", "abstract": "Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs) show great potential as a cell resource for restoring cardiac function in patients affected by heart disease or heart failure. CPCs are proliferative and committed to cardiac fate, capable of generating cells of all the cardiac lineages. These cells offer a significant shift in paradigm over the use of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes owing to the latter's inability to recapitulate mature features of a native myocardium, limiting their translational applications. The iPSCs and direct reprogramming of somatic cells have been attempted to produce CPCs and, in this process, a variety of chemical and/or genetic factors have been evaluated for their ability to generate, expand, and maintain CPCs in vitro. However, the precise stoichiometry and spatiotemporal activity of these factors and the genetic interplay during embryonic CPC development remain challenging to reproduce in culture, in terms of efficiency, numbers, and translational potential. Recent advances in biomaterials to mimic the native cardiac microenvironment have shown promise to influence CPC regenerative functions, while being capable of integrating with host tissue.

{"title": "ERK1/2 Phosphorylation of FHOD Connects Signaling and Nuclear Positioning Alternations in Cardiac Laminopathy.", "abstract": "Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause cardiomyopathy and also disrupt nuclear positioning in fibroblasts. LMNA mutations causing cardiomyopathy elevate ERK1/2 activity in the heart, and inhibition of the ERK1/2 kinase activity ameliorates pathology, but the downstream effectors remain largely unknown. We now show that cardiomyocytes from mice with an Lmna mutation and elevated cardiac ERK1/2 activity have altered nuclear positioning. In fibroblasts, ERK1/2 activation negatively regulated nuclear movement by phosphorylating S498 of FHOD1. Expression of an unphosphorylatable FHOD1 variant rescued the nuclear movement defect in fibroblasts expressing a cardiomyopathy-causing lamin A mutant. In hearts of mice with LMNA mutation-induced cardiomyopathy, ERK1/2 mediated phosphorylation of FHOD3, an isoform highly expressed in cardiac tissue. Phosphorylation of FHOD1 and FHOD3 inhibited their actin bundling activity. These results show that phosphorylation of FHOD proteins by ERK1/2 is a critical switch for nuclear positioning and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations.", "journal": "Developmental cell", "date": "2019-12-04", "authors": ["SusumuAntoku", "WeiWu", "Leroy CJoseph", "John PMorrow", "Howard JWorman", "Gregg GGundersen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.devcel.2019.10.023"}

Restriction of dietary BCAAs in rodent models of obesity lowers circulating BCAA levels and improves whole-animal and skeletal-muscle insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis, but the impact of BCAA supply on heart metabolism has not been studied.

{"title": "Exploring cardiac form and function: A length-scale computational biology approach.", "abstract": "The ability to adequately pump blood throughout the body is the result of tightly regulated feedback mechanisms that exist across many spatial scales in the heart. Diseases which impede the function at any one of the spatial scales can cause detrimental cardiac remodeling and eventual heart failure. An overarching goal of cardiac research is to use engineered heart tissue in vitro to study the physiology of diseased heart tissue, develop cell replacement therapies, and explore drug testing applications. A commonality within the field is to manipulate the flow of mechanical signals across the various spatial scales to direct self-organization and build functional tissue. Doing so requires an understanding of how chemical, electrical, and mechanical cues can be used to alter the cellular microenvironment. We discuss how mathematical models have been used in conjunction with experimental techniques to explore various structure-function relations that exist across numerous spatial scales. We highlight how a systems biology approach can be employed to recapitulate in vivo characteristics in vitro at the tissue, cell, and subcellular scales. Specific focus is placed on the interplay between experimental and theoretical approaches. Various modeling methods are showcased to demonstrate the breadth and power afforded to the systems biology approach. An overview of modeling methodologies exemplifies how the strengths of different scientific disciplines can be used to supplement and/or inspire new avenues of experimental exploration.

Injectable biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering have demonstrated the ability to restore cardiac function by preventing ventricular dilation, enhancing angiogenesis, and improving conduction velocity. However, limitations are still among them, such as poor mechanical stability, low conductivity, and complicated procedure. Here, we developed thermal plastic poly(glycolic acid) surgical suture and mussel-inspired conductive particle's adhesion into a highly elastic, conductive spring-like coils. The polypyrrole (PPy)-coated biospring acted as an electrode and then was assembled into a solid-state supercapacitor. After being injected through a syringe needle (0.33 mm inner diameter), the tangled coils formed an elastically conductive three-dimensional (3-D) network to modulate cardiac function. We found that cardiomyocytes (CMs) grew along the spring coils' track with elongated morphologies and formed highly oriented sarcomeres. The biospring enhanced the CMs' maturation in synchronous contraction accompanied by high expressions of cardiac-specific proteins, \u03b1-actinin, and connexin 43 (cx43).

An I/R model was established by means of recanalization after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery of the rats. The rats in the I/R + MALAT1 siRNA group were used to establish a model of MALAT1 knockdown by injecting MALAT1 siRNA from the tail vein. The myocardial infarction area in each group was detected via 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The ejection fraction% (EF%) and fractional shortening% (FS%) of the heart in each group were measured through echocardiography. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was adopted to determine the morphological changes in myocardial cells in each group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to detect the apoptosis levels of myocardial cells and fibroblasts in the cardiac tissues in each group, and Western blotting assay was conducted to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins [B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)]. In addition, the content of \u03b2-catenin in the three groups of rats was determined via immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the impacts of MALAT1 siRNA on the expression level of \u03b2-catenin protein were detected using Western blotting assay.\nMALAT1 siRNA could prominently ameliorate the I/R-induced cardiac insufficiency in the rats and improve the EF% and FS% of the heart (p<0.05). Moreover, MALAT1 siRNA was able to remarkably inhibit the I/R injury-induced myocardial infarction, reducing the infarction area from (59.54\u00b13.45) to (24.85\u00b11.30; p<0.05). The results of the H&E staining indicated that compared with those in the I/R group, the myofilaments of the myocardial cells were well-arranged, the degrees of degradation and necrosis of the myofilaments declined, and the cellular edema was relieved markedly in the I/R + MALAT1 siRNA group. It was shown in the results of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting that MALAT1 siRNA could notably reverse the I/R-induced up-regulation of \u03b2-catenin expression (p<0.05).\nMALAT1 knockdown can significantly ameliorate the I/R-induced myocardial injury and improve the cardiac function of the rats, whose mechanism is probably correlated with the inhibition of MALAT1 siRNA on \u03b2-catenin. Therefore, MALAT1 siRNA is expected to become a new target for the treatment of myocardial infarction.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2019-11-28", "authors": ["X-ZXu", "BLuo", "YXiao", "W-QZheng"], "doi": "10.26355/eurrev_201911_19450"}
{"title": "Postmortem interval determination using mRNA markers and DNA normalization.", "abstract": "Postmortem interval (PMI) determination is an important part of criminal investigations, but it is still subject to uncertainty. Degradation of mRNA in PMI determination has been studied in decays; however, some studies have reported no correlation between PMI and RNA degradation. Thus, we aimed to determine whether RNA quantity was correlated with PMI. Heart and brain tissues were separated from a mouse model of a 0-48 h PMI with 29 time points. We then coextracted the DNA and RNA in one tube with Bioteke coextraction kits and selected some mRNA markers associated with cell oxygen deprivation and apoptosis as target genes, such as hypoxia-associated factor (HAF), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2a), and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). We measured the quantity of these markers using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Caspase-3 DNA and 18S were each used for normalization. The results showed that in the heart tissue, the degradation of HIF2a, AIF, and FIH was correlated with PMI, as was the degradation of HIF2a, FIH, and AIF in brain tissue when normalized with Caspase-3 DNA. However, when normalized with 18S, only the degradation of HIF2a in brain tissue was correlated with PMI. Interestingly, the quantity of HAF in brain tissue was found to increase after death with either 18S or Caspase-3 DNA normalization, and it was significantly correlated with 0-48 h PMI. These results indicated that mRNA quantity can be used to determine PMI and that Caspase-3 DNA is feasible for PMI estimation. In summary, we established mathematical models for PMI determination using multiple mRNA markers and multiple tissues and further studies are needed to validate and investigate these markers and mathematical models in human tissues.Duo Peng and Meili Lv contributed equally to this work.", "journal": "International journal of legal medicine", "date": "2019-11-28", "authors": ["DuoPeng", "MeiliLv", "ZhilongLi", "HuanTian", "ShengQiuQu", "BoJin", "BingLong", "WeiboLiang", "LinZhang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00414-019-02199-7"}
{"title": "Transcriptome Analysis of Hypertrophic Heart Tissues from Murine Transverse Aortic Constriction and Human Aortic Stenosis Reveals Key Genes and Transcription Factors Involved in Cardiac Remodeling Induced by Mechanical Stress.", "abstract": "Mechanical stress-induced cardiac remodeling that results in heart failure is characterized by transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression. However, a systematic study of genomic changes involved in this process has not been performed to date. To investigate the genomic changes and underlying mechanism of cardiac remodeling, we collected and analyzed DNA microarray data for murine transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and human aortic stenosis (AS) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and the European Bioinformatics Institute.\nThe differential expression genes (DEGs) across the datasets were merged. The Venn diagrams showed that the number of intersections for early and late cardiac remodeling was 74 and 16, respectively. Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that metabolic changes, cell differentiation and growth, cell cycling, and collagen fibril organization accounted for a great portion of the DEGs in the TAC model, while in AS patients' immune system signaling and cytokine signaling displayed the most significant changes. The intersections between the TAC model and AS patients were few. Nevertheless, the DEGs of the two species shared some common regulatory transcription factors (TFs), including SP1, CEBPB, PPARG, and NFKB1, when the heart was challenged by applied mechanical stress.\nThis study unravels the complex transcriptome profiles of the heart tissues and highlighting the candidate genes involved in cardiac remodeling induced by mechanical stress may usher in a new era of precision diagnostics and treatment in patients with cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "Disease markers", "date": "2019-11-28", "authors": ["PengYu", "BaoliZhang", "MingLiu", "YingYu", "JiZhao", "ChunyuZhang", "YanaLi", "LeiZhang", "XueYang", "HongJiang", "YunzengZou", "JunboGe"], "doi": "10.1155/2019/5058313\n10.1016/j.carpath.2011.11.007\n10.1093/cvr/cvu122\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.07.013\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.632430\n10.3791/1729\n10.3390/genes9010056\n10.1186/s12859-015-0611-3\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu684\n10.1093/nar/gkw937\n10.1038/nprot.2012.004\n10.1093/nar/gkx1013\n10.1152/ajpheart.00050.2015\n10.1172/JCI79964\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00040.2004\n10.1073/pnas.0602543103\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00071.2003\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.01.030\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.90296.2008\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00028.2006\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306721\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131019\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001469\n10.1038/ncomms12418\n10.1161/circulationaha.117.028561\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.002\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029430\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.014\n10.1038/nature12504\n10.1038/nature12146\n10.1038/nature06396\n10.1038/nchembio.1429\n10.1074/jbc.M605789200\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.027\n10.1093/hmg/ddu286\n10.1161/01.RES.0000104085.76261.02\n10.1152/ajpheart.00451.2010\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.036\n10.1007/s10741-008-9114-x\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.11.007\n10.1111/jcmm.12743"}

{"title": "Effect of Rosmarinic Acid and Sinapic Acid on Oxidative Stress Parameters in the Cardiac Tissue and Serum of Type 2 Diabetic Female Rats.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common complications of type 2 diabetes. They are considered the leading cause of death among diabetics. One of the mechanisms underlying diabetic cardiovascular complications is oxidative stress. Many phenolic acids are regarded as antioxidants. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of rosmarinic acid (RA) and sinapic acid (SA) on oxidative stress parameters in the cardiac tissue and serum of type 2 diabetic female rats. Additionally, the effect of these compounds on glucose homeostasis and lipid profile in the serum was evaluated. Type 2 diabetes was induced with high-fat diet and streptozotocin. RA at the doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg and SA at the doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg were administrated orally for 28 days.

In this study Balb/c mice were intramuscularly immunized with S. pyogenes SF370 for 4 weeks. Prior to euthanization, physiological parameters like body weight and electrical signalling of the heart were recorded. After euthanization, the heart tissue homogenate was prepared and proteomic alterations were studied using SDS-PAGE and 2D electrophoresis. The expression levels of inflammatory genes like TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3\u00a0and TGF-\u03b2\u00a0were quantified using real time PCR. Insilico analysis was performed to identify the functions of hypothetical proteins and virulence factors involved in the induction of rheumatic carditis. The results showed a reduction in body weight, ulceration, inflammation, cardiac lesions and prolonged PR interval in mice immunized with S. pyogenes SF370, as a result of RHD. The heart related proteins like \u03b1-actinin, fatty acid binding protein-heart, myosin light chain 3, hemoglobin subunit alpha, myoglobin regulatory light chain 2, (ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform), myosin-6, troponin-1 were found to be up-regulated when compared with the control. The functional annotation of S. pyogenes (SF370) was carried out by retrieving 1696 identified proteins and 653 hypothetical protein sequences in NCBI genome database. The conserved domain was identified for 505 proteins. The pfam database documented that the super families of 279 sequences and 40 signal peptides enabled the classification of proteins in different categories like biological (20%), cellular (22%) and molecular functions (36%). Putative transcription repair coupling factor and putative lysine aminopeptidase N terminal are the two virulence factors identified by VICMPRED in S. pyogenes SF370. The two identified virulence factors are involved in altering the mice heart proteome and thereby controlling the streptococcus pyogenes infection.

{"title": "Zinc protects against cadmium-induced toxicity in neonatal murine engineered cardiac tissues via metallothionein-dependent and independent mechanisms.", "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential heavy metal and a prevalent environmental toxin that has been shown to induce significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis in neonatal murine engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs). In contrast, zinc (Zn) is a potent metallothionein (MT) inducer, which plays an important role in protection against Cd toxicity. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of Zn against Cd toxicity in ECTs and explore the underlying mechanisms. ECTs were constructed from neonatal ventricular cells of wild-type (WT) mice and mice with global MT gene deletion (MT-KO). In WT-ECTs, Cd (5-20 \u03bcM) caused a dose-dependent toxicity that was detected within 8\u2009h evidenced by suppressed beating, apoptosis, and LDH release; Zn (50-200 \u03bcM) dose-dependently induced MT expression in ECTs without causing ECT toxicity; co-treatment of ECT with Zn (50\u2009\u00b5M) prevented Cd-induced toxicity. In MT-KO ECTs, Cd toxicity was enhanced; but unexpectedly, cotreatment with Zn provided partial protection against Cd toxicity. Furthermore, Cd, but not Zn, significantly activated Nrf2 and its downstream targets, including HO-1; inhibition of HO-1 by a specific HO-1 inhibitor, ZnPP (10\u2009\u00b5M), significantly increased Cd-induced toxicity, but did not inhibit Zn protection against Cd injury, suggesting that Nrf2-mediated HO-1 activation was not required for Zn protective effect. Finally, the ability of Zn to reduce Cd uptake provided an additional MT-independent mechanism for reducing Cd toxicity. Thus, Zn exerts protective effects against Cd toxicity for murine ECTs that are partially MT-mediated.

Depletion of Kindlin-2 contributes to cardiac hypertrophy and progressive heart failure, however, the precise mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear. GATA4 is a critical transcription factor in regulating cardiogenesis. We found that Kindlin-2 suppresses the expression of GATA4 through binding to its promoter and prevents cardiomyocytes from hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (ISO) treatment. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 interacts with histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and recruits it to GATA4 promoter leading to the occupancy of histone H3K9 di- and tri-methylation. Furthermore, to confirm the function of Kindlin-2 in vivo, we generated mice with targeted deletion of cardiac Kindlin-2. We found that 6-month-old Kindlin-2 cKO mice have developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that this pathological process can be accelerated by ISO-treatment. GATA4 expression was markedly activated in cardiac tissues of Kindlin-2 cKO mice compared to wild-type animals.

{"title": "MicroRNA expression signatures of atrial fibrillation: The critical systematic review and bioinformatics analysis.", "abstract": "Association between microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures and atrial fibrillation has been evaluated with inconsistent findings in different studies. This study aims to identify miRNAs that actually play vital role in pathophysiological process of atrial fibrillation and explore miRNA-targeted genes and the involved pathways. Relevant studies were retrieved from the electronic databases of Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library to determine the miRNA expression profiles between atrial fibrillation subjects and non-atrial fibrillation controls. Robustness of results was assessed using sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed based on species, miRNA detection method, sample source, and ethnicity. Quality assessment of studies was independently conducted according to QUADAS-2. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to explore the potential genes and pathways associated with atrial fibrillation, which were targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. Form of pooled results was shown as log10 odds ratios (logORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and random-effects model was used. In total, 40 articles involving 283 differentially expressed miRNAs were reported. And 51 significantly dysregulated miRNAs were identified in consistent direction, with 22 upregulated and 29 downregulated. Among above-mentioned miRNAs, miR-223-3p (logOR 6.473; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was the most upregulated, while miR-1-5p (logOR 7.290; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was the most downregulated. Subgroup analysis confirmed 53 significantly dysregulated miRNAs (21 upregulated and 32 downregulated) in cardiac tissue, with miRNA-1-5p and miRNA-223-3p being the most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs, respectively. Additionally, miR-328 and miR-1-5p were highly blood-specific, and miR-133 was animal-specific. In the detection method sub-groups, miRNA-29b and miRNA-223-3p were differentially expressed consistently. Four miRNAs, including miRNA-223-3p, miRNA-21, miRNA-328, and miRNA-1-5p, were consistently dysregulated in both Asian and non-Asian. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that 47 out of 51 (92.16%) miRNAs were dysregulated consistently.

Five important miRNAs, including miR-29b, miR-328, miR-1-5p, miR-21, and miR-223-3p may act as potential biomarkers for atrial fibrillation.\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is considered as the most common arrhythmia, and it subsequently causes serious complications including thrombosis and heart failure that increase the social burden. The definite mechanisms underlying AF pathogenesis remain complicated and unclear. Many studies attempted to discover the transcriptomic changes using microarray technologies, and the present studies for this hot topic have assessed individual miRNAs profiles for AF. However, results of different articles are controversial and not each reported miRNA is actually associated with the pathogenesis of AF. The present systematic review and meta-analysis identified that 51 consistently dysregulated miRNAs were associated with AF. Of these miRNAs, five miRNAs (miRNA-1-5p, miRNA-328, miRNA-29b, miRNA-21, and miRNA-223-3p) may act as novel biomarkers for AF.

This partly arises from the presence of activated phagocytes releasing myeloperoxidase (MPO) and its production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The dietary supplement selenomethionine (SeMet) has been shown to bolster endogenous antioxidant processes as well as readily react with MPO-derived oxidants. The aim of this study was to assess whether supplementation with SeMet could modulate the extent of cellular damage observed in an in vitro cardiac myocyte model exposed to (patho)-physiological levels of HOCl and an in vivo rat model of cardiac I/R injury. Exposure of the H9c2 cardiac myoblast cell line to HOCl resulted in a dose-dependent increase in necrotic cell death, which could be prevented by SeMet supplementation and was attributed to SeMet preventing the HOCl-induced loss of mitochondrial inner trans-membrane potential, and the associated cytosolic calcium accumulation. This protection was credited primarily to the direct oxidant scavenging ability of SeMet, with a minor contribution arising from the ability of SeMet to bolster cardiac myoblast glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity.

{"title": "Engineered Cardiac Pacemaker Nodes Created by TBX18 Gene Transfer Overcome Source-Sink Mismatch.", "abstract": "Every heartbeat originates from a tiny tissue in the heart called the sinoatrial node (SAN). The SAN harbors only \u224810 000 cardiac pacemaker cells, initiating an electrical impulse that captures the entire heart, consisting of billions of cardiomyocytes for each cardiac contraction. How these rare cardiac pacemaker cells (the electrical source) can overcome the electrically hyperpolarizing and quiescent myocardium (the electrical sink) is incompletely understood. Due to the scarcity of native pacemaker cells, this concept of source-sink mismatch cannot be tested directly with live cardiac tissue constructs. By exploiting TBX18 induced pacemaker cells by somatic gene transfer, 3D cardiac pacemaker spheroids can be tissue-engineered.

Ten different species (n = 3, total = 30) of live ornamental fish were randomly sampled from one big aquarium in a pet store in Belgium. All fish samples were dissected manually for the collection of targeted tissues. The tissue samples were ashed by microwave oven, and the extract was analyzed for copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and Zinc (Zn) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Fe was associated with Cu in muscle tissue (p < 0.05), but neither of them were associated with Zn in the muscle. However, the three micromineral concentrations were correlated in the heart (p < 0.05). Similarly, all of them were correlated in the liver (p < 0.05), but none of them showed a significant association in the tail fin. Excess deposition of minerals in heart tissue is a new observation, and it is not known if this is meant as storage or rather the fish heart has a high requirement for microminerals. Storage in the tail fin should be interpreted as a sign of permanent deposition as a tool to dispose off toxic excess. The lack of correlation between the muscular concentrations of Zn on the one hand, and those of Fe and Cu on the other hand, further suggests that fish species distinctly differ in their micromineral metabolism.

Despite the investigation of a broad range of pharmacologic interventions, to date the only drug shown to reduce DOX-related cardiotoxicity in preclinical studies and limited clinical trials is the iron chelating agent, dexrazoxane (DRZ), although the mechanisms responsible for DRZ mediated protection from DOX related cardiotoxicity remain unclear. Engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) can be used for tissue repair strategies and as in vitro surrogate models to test cardiac toxicities and preventative countermeasures. Neonatal murine ECTs display cardiotoxicity in response to the environmental toxin, cadmium, and reduced cadmium toxicity with Zinc co-treatment, in part via the induction of the anti-oxidant Metallothionein (MT).

We investigated the physical and protein cues from the extracellular matrix to engineer anisotropic cardiac tissues as highly aligned monolayers on top of the microelectrode array (MEA). The MEA platform allows non-invasive measurement of beating rate and conduction velocity. The effect of different extracellular proteins was tested by using the most common extracellular matrix proteins in the heart, fibronectin and gelatin, after aligning myocytes using a microcontact (\u03bcC) printing technique. Both proteins showed similar electrophysiological results before the monolayer began to delaminate after the sixth day of culture. Additionally, there were no significant differences on day 4 between the two microcontact printed proteins in terms of sarcomere alignment and gap junction expression. To test the effect of substrate stiffness, a micromolded (\u03bcM) gelatin hydrogel was fabricated in different concentrations (20% and 2%), corresponding to the elastic moduli of approximately 33 kPa and 0.7 kPa, respectively, to cover both spectra of the in vivo range of myocardium. Cardiac monolayers under micromolded conditions beat in a much more synchronized fashion, and exhibited conduction velocity that was close to the physiological value. Both concentrations of gelatin hydrogel conditions yielded similar sarcomere alignment and gap junction expression on day 4 of culture. Ultimately, the 3D micromolded gelatin hydrogel that recapitulated myocardial stiffness improved the synchronicity and conduction velocity of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) without any stimulation.

Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism of alcohol-induced cardiac dysplasia remains unknown. We previously reported that alcohol exposure during pregnancy can cause abnormal expression of cardiomyogenesis-related genes, and histone H3K9me3 hypomethylation was observed in alcohol-treated foetal mouse heart. Hence, an imbalance in histone methylation may be involved in alcohol-induced cardiac dysplasia. In this study, we investigated the involvement of G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase in alcohol-induced cardiac dysplasia in vivo and in vitro using heart tissues of foetal mice and primary cardiomyocytes of neonatal mice. Western blotting revealed that alcohol caused histone H3K9me3 hypomethylation by altering G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase expression in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, overexpression of cardiomyogenesis-related genes (MEF2C, Cx43, ANP and \u03b2-MHC) was observed in alcohol-exposed foetal mouse heart. Additionally, we demonstrated that G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase directly interacted with histone H3K9me3 and altered its methylation. Notably, alcohol did not down-regulate H3K9me3 methylation after G9\u03b1 suppression by short hairpin RNA in primary mouse cardiomyocytes, preventing MEF2C, Cx43, ANP and \u03b2-MHC overexpression. These findings suggest that G9\u03b1 histone methyltransferase-mediated imbalance in histone H3K9me3 methylation plays a critical role in alcohol-induced abnormal expression cardiomyogenesis-related genes during pregnancy.

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we conducted experiments to determine ultrastructural changes of rabbit cardiac tissue under different experimental conditions, including differing doses of trastuzumab and supplementation with oral sodium selenite, an antioxidant. Histopathology revealed lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration in myocardium of rabbits receiving four doses of trastuzumab. Transmission electron microscopy showed substantial changes with trastuzumab, including edema with separation of myofibril bundles and rupture of sarcomeres. Within mitochondria, edema resulted in disorganization of the cristae. Some mitochondria exhibited eccentric projections of their membranes with disruption of both inner and outer membranes. These changes were seen to a lesser extent in rabbits who received oral sodium selenite prior to trastuzumab. Selenium is integral to functioning of mitochondrial glutathione peroxidases, important antioxidants that also maintain membrane integrity. If mitochondria are disrupted as part of trastuzumab cardiac toxicity, selenium supplementation might be an important therapeutic or preventive consideration.

NRK-2 expression dramatically increases in mouse and human ischemic heart however, the specific role of NRK-2 in the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiac diseases is unknown. We employed NRK2 knockout (KO) mice to identify the role of NRK-2 in ischemia-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Following myocardial infarction (MI), or sham surgeries, serial echocardiography was performed in the KO and littermate control mice. Cardiac contractile function rapidly declined and left ventricular interior dimension (LVID) was significantly increased in the ischemic KO vs. control mice at 2\u00a0weeks post-MI. An increase in mortality was observed in the KO vs. control group. The KO hearts displayed increased cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure reflected by morphometric analysis. Consistently, histological assessment revealed an extensive and thin scar and dilated LV chamber accompanied with elevated fibrosis in the KOs post-MI. Mechanistically, we observed that loss of NRK-2 enhanced p38\u03b1 activation following ischemic injury. Consistently, ex vivo studies demonstrated that the gain of NRK-2 function suppresses the p38\u03b1 as well as fibroblast activation (\u03b1-SMA expression) upon TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, and limits cardiomyocytes death upon hypoxia/re\u2011oxygenation.

{"title": "Effect of ghrelin on VEGF-B and connexin-43 in a rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Background Since their discovery in the early 1960s, doxorubicin (DOX) remains the most effective anticancer drug. However, this drug has confirmed to be a double-edged sword because it causes a cardiomyopathy that leads to congestive heart failure. Ghrelin, a multi-functional peptide, plays an important role in cardiovascular protection. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ghrelin on vascular endothelial growth factor-beta (VEGF-B) and connexin-43 (Cx43) expression in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Methods Forty adult male rats were divided randomly into four groups: normal, normal + ghrelin, DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, and DOX-induced cardiomyopathy + ghrelin. Biochemical and histopathological analysis, electrocardiograph (ECG), heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and immunohistochemical staining of VEGF-B and Cx43 were assessed for all rats in heart tissue specimens. The duration of the study was 2 weeks. Results DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in rats showed significant ECG changes such as prolongation of PR, QT, QTC intervals and ST segment, a decrease in amplitude and an increase in the duration of QRS complex, bradycardia, and a decrease in SBP. Also, rats in the DOX group showed myocardial histopathological damage in the form of severe fibrosis with decreased expression of Cx43 and a non-significant difference in expression of VEGF-B when compared to normal rats. Treatment with ghrelin resulted in a significant improvement in all the studied parameters and was associated with an increase in VEGF-B and Cx43 expression. Conclusions Ghrelin has a beneficial effect against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy which may be mediated through VEGF-B and Cx43 expression in the myocardium.

{"title": "Development and characterization of a suturable biomimetic patch for cardiac applications.", "abstract": "3D scaffolds used to repair damaged tissues should be able to mimic both composition and functions of natural extracellular matrix, which is mainly composed of polysaccharides and proteins. In our previous research new biomimetic sponges, based on blends of alginate with gelatin, were produced and characterized for myocardial tissue engineering applications. It was observed that these scaffolds can potentially function as a promising cardiac extracellular matrix substitute, but a reinforcement is required to improve their suturing properties. Aim of the present work was the development of a suturable biomimetic patch by the inclusion of a synthetic mesh within an alginate/gelatin scaffold. The mesh, produced by dry spinning, was made of eight superimposed layers of polycaprolactone microfibers, each one rotated of 45\u00b0 with respect to the adjacent one. Reinforced scaffolds were obtained through the use of a mold, specially designed to place the fibrous mesh exactly in the center of the sponge. Both the reinforcement mesh and the reinforced scaffold were characterized. A perfect integration between the mesh and the sponge was observed. The fibrous mesh reduced the capacity of the sponge to absorb water, but the degree of hydrophilicity of the material was still comparable with that of natural cardiac tissue. The reinforced system showed a suitable stability in aqueous environment and it resulted much more resistant to suturing than not reinforced scaffold and even than human arteries. Polycaprolactone mesh was not cytotoxic and the reinforced scaffold was able to support cardiomyocytes adhesion and proliferation. Overall, the obtained results confirmed that the choice to modify the alginate/gelatin sponges through the insertion of an appropriate reinforcement system turned out to be correct in view of their potential use in myocardial tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of materials science.

Bisphenol A induced a significant increase in mean values of serum copeptin level, histopathological changes in the form of dilated congested blood vessels and extensive collagen fiber deposition in the myocardium. Ultrastructurally, disturbed indented nuclei, focal lysis of myofibrils, normal cross striations loss, mitochondrial swelling, and intercalated disks distortion were noticed. Immunohistochemical study showed a significant increase in TLR2 immunoreactions in the myocytes of BPA administered rats.

However, doxorubicin may cause cardiac toxicity, which can cause congestive heart failure in severe cases, and this seriously limits its clinical application. It is believed that doxorubicin promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species, inducing oxidative stress, and at the same time, reduces the content of antioxidant substances in cardiac tissues, causing adverse effects. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are biomolecules expressed on the surfaces of macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells that can recognize various types of pathogen-related or damage-related molecular patterns.

However, most heart-on-a-chips are not developed for online and continuous monitoring of contractile behavior, which are the main functional characteristics of cardiac tissue. In this study, we designed and investigated on a heart-on-a-chip platform that provides online monitoring of contractile behavior of a 3D cardiac tissue construct. The contractile behavior include contraction force, frequency, and synchronization. They can be evaluated by an image processing system and a piezoelectric sensing system simultaneously. Based on the deformation of a micro-pillar array embedded within the 3D cardiac tissue upon subjected to cardiac contraction, the image processing system provides in situ multi-site detection of the contractile behavior. At the same time, the piezoelectric sensing system measures the contractile behavior of the entire cardiac tissue construct. A 3D cardiac tissue construct was successfully fabricated. Then the heart-on-a-chip platform was validated by applying various motion patterns on the micro-pillars, which mimicked the contraction patterns of the 3D cardiac tissue. The drug reactivity of the 3D cardiac tissue construct after a treatment of isoproterenol and doxorubicin was evaluated by measuring the contractile behavior via the image processing and the piezoelectric sensing systems.

{"title": "The Effects of Progranulin in a Rat Model of Acute Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion are Mediated by Activation of the P13K/Akt Signaling Pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Progranulin is an adipokine, encoded by the progranulin (GRN) gene. Progranulin is expressed in atherosclerosis, but its effects in cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of progranulin in a rat model of acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS The model of acute MI/R injury was established in male Wistar rats by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 30 minutes and reperfusion for 60 minutes. Before modeling, one group was treated with progranulin (0.03 \u00b5g/kg), and one group was treated with the P13K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002 (3 mg/kg). Left ventricular function (LV) was monitored, including the LV systolic pressure (LVSP), LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and changes in LV pressure. At the end of the study, blood and myocardial tissue were examined. Cardiac biochemical markers, histopathology, gene expression, and apoptosis were analyzed. RESULTS Progranulin improved cardiac function following acute MI/R injury and significantly improved recovery of cardiac contractility and LVSP. Progranulin significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis, inflammation, and tissue edema, and was highly expressed in cardiac tissue following MI/R injury. The cardioprotective effect of progranulin was reduced by blocking the P13K/Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS In the rat model of acute MI/R injury, progranulin had a protective effect on cardiac function and morphology, associated with activation of the P13K/Akt signaling pathway. The mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and inotropic effects of progranulin in the setting of acute MI/R injury require further in vivo studies.", "journal": "Medical science monitor basic research", "date": "2019-11-07", "authors": ["Asma MohammedAlyahya", "AbeerAl-Masri", "AhmadHersi", "EmanEl Eter", "SufiaHusain", "RahmatunnesaLateef", "Ola HMawlana"], "doi": "10.12659/MSMBR.916258"}
{"title": "Mitochondrial transplantation enhances murine lung viability and recovery after ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "The most common cause of acute lung injury is ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), during which mitochondrial damage occurs. We have previously demonstrated that mitochondrial transplantation is an efficacious therapy to replace or augment mitochondria damaged by IRI, allowing for enhanced muscle viability and function in cardiac tissue. Here, we investigate the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation in a murine lung IRI model using male C57BL/6J mice. Transient ischemia was induced by applying a microvascular clamp on the left hilum for 2 h. Upon reperfusion mice received either vehicle or vehicle-containing mitochondria either by vascular delivery (Mito V) through the pulmonary artery or by aerosol delivery (Mito Neb) via the trachea (nebulization). Sham control mice underwent thoracotomy without hilar clamping and were ventilated for 2 h before returning to the cage. After 24 h recovery, lung mechanics were assessed and lungs were collected for analysis. Our results demonstrated that at 24 h of reperfusion, dynamic compliance and inspiratory capacity were significantly increased and resistance, tissue damping, elastance, and peak inspiratory pressure (Mito V only) were significantly decreased (", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of Huoxue Qianyang (HXQY) decoction on cardiac remodeling in obese spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and explore its impacts on the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) ER stress signaling pathway.\nTwenty-seven obese SHRs were randomly divided into Obese SHR, Obese SHR\u202f+\u202fHXQY and Obese SHR\u202f+\u202fValsartan groups, and treated with the indicated drugs for 8 weeks. Nine age-matched male SHRs were used as controls. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), body weight (BW), and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were measured weekly or at end point.

Here, we report a new technique for engineering human cardiac tissue with perfusable blood vessels. Our method involved the layering of cardiac cell sheets derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) on a vascular bed derived from porcine small intestinal tissue.\nFor the vascular bed, a segment of porcine small intestine was harvested together with a branch of the superior mesenteric artery and a branch of the superior mesenteric vein. The small intestinal tissue was incised longitudinally, and the mucosa was resected. Human cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs were co-cultured with endothelial cells and fibroblasts on a temperature-responsive dish and harvested as a cardiac cell sheet. A triple-layer of cardiac cell sheets was placed onto the vascular bed, and the resulting construct was subjected to perfusion culture in a bioreactor system.\nThe cardiac tissue on the vascular bed pulsated spontaneously and synchronously after one day of perfusion culture.

We developed a straight-forward high throughput screen with simple readouts to identify small molecules that modulate cardiomyocyte proliferation. We identify human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiCMs) as a model system for such a screen, as a very small subset of hiCMs have the potential to proliferate. The ability of hiCMs to proliferate is density-dependent, and cell density has no effect on the outcome of proliferation: cytokinesis or binucleation.

Using a Langendorff apparatus, excised rat hearts underwent 40\u2009min of global ischemia without irrigation and then 30\u2009min of reperfusion. GGT activity was markedly increased in cardiac tissues exposed to ischemia, and was inhibited by the treatment with GGsTop. Exacerbation of cardiac functional parameters caused by ischemia and reperfusion, namely the reduction of left ventricular (LV) developed pressure and the maximum and negative minimum values of the first derivative of LV pressure, and the increment in LV end-diastolic pressure was significantly attenuated by GGsTop treatment. The treatment with GGsTop suppressed excessive norepinephrine release in the coronary perfusate, a marker for myocardial dysfunction, after ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, oxidative stress indicators in myocardium, including superoxide and malondialdehyde, after ischemia/reperfusion were significantly low in the presence of GGsTop. These observations demonstrate that enhanced GGT activity contributes to cardiac damage after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, possibly via increased oxidative stress and subsequent norepinephrine overflow.

In this study, we evaluated the myocardial and PBMCs GRK2 levels in early diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM).\nC57BL/KS-db/db male diabetic mice at 12\u2009weeks of age, as the type 2 diabetes (T2DM) animal model of early DCM were evaluated. Forty-four T2DM patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), without evidence of hypertension, coronary artery diseases, congestive heart failure, and diabetic complications and without evidence of ischemia in a maximal treadmill exercise test, were recruited as the DM\u2009+\u2009LVDD group; 30 age-matched T2DM patients without LVDD were recruited as the DM control group. Left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated by cardiac tissue Doppler. The pseudonormal pattern of ventricular filling and E'/A'\u2009<\u20091 were regarded as LVDD.\nCompared to 8-week-old diabetic mice and 12-week-old control mice, GRK2-mRNA level and expression in myocardial tissues of 12-week-old diabetic mice were significantly increased, as well as the left ventricular wall thickness and systolic function. And the collagen volume fraction (CVF), collagen-3 expression, P53 expression, and cell apoptotic rate in the myocardium of 12-week-old diabetic mice elevated as well. The GRK2-mRNA level in PBMCs of DM with LVDD was significantly higher than in DM control without LVDD.\nGRK2 expression increased in the myocardial tissue and the PBMCs at the early stage of DCM. These data support further research on the role of GRK2 as the clinical biomarker for early DCM.\n\u80cc\u666f: \u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aG\u86cb\u767d\u5076\u8054\u53d7\u4f53\u6fc0\u91762(GRK2)\u662f\u8c03\u8282\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u5b50, \u800c\u5fc3\u808cGRK2\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5916\u5468\u8840\u5355\u6838\u7ec6\u80de(PBMC)\u7684GRK2\u8868\u8fbe\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6027\u5fc3\u808c\u75c5(DCM)PBMC\u7684GRK2\u6c34\u5e73\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5: \u52a8\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u4ee512\u5468\u9f84\u7684C57BL/KS-db/db\u96c4\u6027\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5c0f\u9f20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671fDCM\u76842\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5(T2DM)\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4eba\u7fa4\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u62db\u52df\u4e8644\u4f4dT2DM\u4f34\u6709\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u8212\u5f20\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d(LVDD)\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e3aDM + LVDD\u7ec4, \u4ed6\u4eec\u5747\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u3001\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u5145\u8840\u6027\u5fc3\u529b\u8870\u7aed\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u7b49\u75be\u75c5, \u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d1f\u8377\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u8840\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u62db\u52df 30\u4f4d\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65e0LVDD\u7684T2DM\u60a3\u8005\u4e3aDM\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u8212\u5f20\u529f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u810f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5047\u6027\u6b63\u5e38\u5316\u5145\u76c8\u548cE\u2019/A\u2019 <1\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3aLVDD\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c: \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a, \u4e0e8\u5468\u9f84\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5c0f\u9f20\u548c12\u5468\u9f84\u5bf9\u7167\u5c0f\u9f20\u76f8\u6bd4, 12\u5468\u9f84\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5c0f\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2dGRK2-mRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u660e\u663e\u589e\u52a0, \u4e14\u5de6\u5fc3\u5ba4\u58c1\u539a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u6536\u7f29\u529f\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u80f6\u539f\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570(CVF)\u3001\u80f6\u539f\u86cb\u767d3\u3001P53\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u7387\u572812\u5468\u9f84\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5c0f\u9f20\u5fc3\u808c\u4e2d\u4e5f\u660e\u663e\u5347\u9ad8\u3002\u4eba\u7fa4\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a, \u4e0eDM\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005\u76f8\u6bd4, DM+LVDD\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005PBMC\u4e2dGRK2-mRNA\u6c34\u5e73\u660e\u663e\u5347\u9ad8\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba: \u5728DCM\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5, \u5fc3\u808c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548cPBMC\u7684GRK2\u6c34\u5e73\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8GRK2\u5728\u65e9\u671fDCM\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002.", "journal": "Journal of diabetes", "date": "2019-11-05", "authors": ["ShuiqingLai", "XiaoyingFu", "ShufenYang", "ShutingZhang", "QiuxiongLin", "MengzhenZhang", "HongmeiChen"], "doi": "10.1111/1753-0407.12991"}

Animals used in this study were categorized into four groups. The first group was treated with sodium carboxymethylcellulose (0.3%; CMC-Na) solution. The second group received Dox (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 6, 12, 18, and 24. The third and fourth groups received Dox (3 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 6, 12, 18, and 24 and received protective doses of genistein (100 [group 3] and 200 [group 4] mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 30 days. Treatment with genistein significantly improved the altered cardiac function markers and oxidative stress markers. This was coupled with significant improvement in cardiac histopathological features. Genistein enhanced the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which showed protection against oxidative insult induced by Dox. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay showed substantial inhibition of apoptosis by genistein in myocardia. The study showed that genistein has a strong reactive oxygen species scavenging property and potentially (P \u2264 .001) decreases the lipid peroxidation as well as inhibits DNA damage in cardiac toxicity induced by Dox. In conclusion, the potential antioxidant effect of genistein may be because of its modulatory effect on Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and by this means exhibits cardioprotective effects from Dox-induced oxidative injury.", "journal": "Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer", "date": "2019-11-05", "authors": ["MiaoChen", "Vijaya PaulSamuel", "YiWu", "MinyanDang", "YukiatLin", "RaghavaSriramaneni", "Sushil KumarSah", "Gopala KrishnaChinnaboina", "GuangpingZhang"], "doi": "10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2019029341"}

With novel microRNAs being evolutionarily discovered, numbers of them remained functionally unknown. We aimed to discover novel microRNAs with therapeutic or diagnostic potential in the setting of early cardiac I/R injury.\nCardiac electrical activity, biochemical detection and histopathology analysis were performed to reveal early changes of cardiac I/R injury. A microRNA array was performed to screen differential microRNAs in the mouse model of cardiac I/R injury. The differentially expressed microRNAs were validated in cardiac tissues and in serum samples.\nThe abnormality in electrocardiogram and increases in serum cTnI levels suggested the successful establishment of cardiac I/R injury in mice. A total of 1882 microRNAs were identified, of which 11 were significantly down-regulated and 41 were significantly up-regulated at 3\u2009h post reperfusion. microRNA 223-3p and microRNA 3113-5p were among the mostly altered microRNAs and were validated to be up-regulated within the early hours of I/R injury in heart tissues. In the circulating system, cTnI, a sensitive marker of cardiac injury, or microRNA 223-3p only increased within the first 6\u2009h post I/R injury.

Here a novel strategy is presented to direct three-dimensional (3D) cellular alignment by embedding cell/collagen hydrogel into the predefined electrohydrodynamically-printed microlattices. The cell/collagen hydrogel, originally filled within the printed microlattices uniformly, was found to gradually develop into densely-populated and highly-aligned bands along the longitudinal direction of the printed microlattices. The cellular alignment was highly dependent on the height, spacing and orientation of the microlattices. The presented method was applicable to multiple cell types including primary cardiomyocytes and the gaps formed between the aligned bands and the lateral walls of the microlattice facilitated the subsequent seeding and rapid alignment of other cell types which enables to engineer anisotropic multicellular tissue constructs. The engineered cardiac patches expressed mature cardiomyocyte-specific phenotypes and exhibited synchronous contractive activities. Multilayer cellular alignment with varied orientation in 3D collagen hydrogel was successfully achieved by using electrohydrodynamically-printed microlattices with layer-specific orientations. This exploration offers a promising way to engineer complex 3D tissue constructs with predefined cellular alignments.

Upon aging, extracellular cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling appeared with accumulation of collagen in Lmna R225X mutant hearts as visualized by Masson's trichrome stain. This could be explained by the upregulated ECM gene expression, such as Fibronectin: Fn1, collagen: Col12a1, intergrin: Itgb2 and 3, as detected by microarray gene chip. Also, endurance exercise for 3 month improved the ventricular ejection fraction, attenuated fibrosis and cardiomyocytes apoptosis in the aged mutant mice.\nThe mechanism of LMNA nonsense mutation induced cardiac conduction defects through AV node fibrosis is due to upregulated ECM gene expression upon activation of cardiac apoptosis.

In this study, we found that miR-665 was enriched in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes, and then investigated the underlying role of nuclear miR-665 in heart failure. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization assays in human heart tissue sections and primary cardiomyocytes showed that miR-665 was localized in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes. Increased expression of nuclear miR-665 was observed not only in the cardiomyocytes isolated from the heart of mice treated in vivo by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), but also in phenylephrine (PE)-treated cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro. To further explore the role of miR-665 in heart failure, a type 9 recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) system was employed to manipulate the expression of miR-665 in mice. Overexpression of miR-665 aggravated TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction, while down-expression of miR-665 showed opposite effects. Bioinformatic prediction and biological validation confirmed that the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene was one of the targets of miR-665 in the nucleus.

The presence of high-conductance connexin 43 (Cx43) was evaluated in SVC cross-sections using immunofluorescence. It was found that SVC myocardium is excitable, electrically coupled with the atrial tissue, and conducts excitation waves at all stages of postnatal development. However, the conduction velocity (CV) of excitation and action potential (AP) upstroke velocity in SVC were significantly lower in neonatal than in adult animals and increased with postnatal maturation. Connexins Cx43 were identified in both neonatal and adult rat SVC myocardium; however, the abundance of Cx43 was significantly less in neonates. The gap junction uncoupler octanol affected conduction more profound in the neonatal than in adult SVC. We demonstrated for the first time that the conduction characteristics of SVC myocardium change from a slow-conduction (nodal) to a high-conduction (working) phenotype during postnatal ontogenesis. An age-related CV increase may occur due to changes of AP characteristics, electrical coupling, and Cx43 presence in SVC cardiomyocyte membranes.

Our findings show functional recovery post-MI using rHCI by promoting a healing environment, cardiomyocyte survival, and less pathological remodeling of the myocardium.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2019-10-28", "authors": ["SarahMcLaughlin", "BrianMcNeill", "JamesPodrebarac", "KatsuhiroHosoyama", "VeronikaSedlakova", "GregoryCron", "DavidSmyth", "RichardSeymour", "KeshavGoel", "WenbinLiang", "Katey JRayner", "MarcRuel", "Erik JSuuronen", "Emilio IAlarcon"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-12748-8\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306838\n10.1101/gad.2018411\n10.1016/j.recesp.2012.11.013\n10.1016/j.stem.2015.06.007\n10.1006/jmcc.2001.1506\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1016/j.lfs.2012.08.034\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.07.015\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.056952\n10.1016/S0945-053X(00)00076-7\n10.1155/2011/179057\n10.1016/j.lfs.2010.07.010\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.939512\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.06.010\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005503\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.011\n10.1016/j.ahj.2015.08.017\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv259\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021571\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.11.004\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.02.028\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.11.001\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.09.013\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.04.056\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1860\n10.1016/S0190-9622(89)70330-3\n10.1016/j.smim.2007.11.003\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3001022\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.108.839761\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000121424.76486.20\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2007.11.017\n10.1113/eph8702385\n10.1369/0022155413493912\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1152/ajpheart.00553.2013\n10.1021/acsnano.7b09107\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003997\n10.3389/fbioe.2016.00062\n10.1186/s13287-015-0237-4\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00212-6\n10.1002/bip.22486\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.078\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.04.011\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.11.061\n10.1161/01.CIR.76.1.44\n10.1161/01.CIR.87.3.755\n10.15420/ecr.2015:9:3\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1007/s11897-012-0116-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300507\n10.1089/ars.2012.4849\n10.1038/nrcardio.2009.103\n10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.01.001\n10.1186/s12929-017-0322-3\n10.1007/s00018-014-1796-8\n10.2174/1573403X14666180111145207\n10.1039/C5TB02035B\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025045\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303567\n10.1113/jphysiol.2014.285551"}

{"title": "The rationale and emergence of electroconductive biomaterial scaffolds in cardiac tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The human heart possesses minimal regenerative potential, which can often lead to chronic heart failure following myocardial infarction. Despite the successes of assistive support devices and pharmacological therapies, only a whole heart transplantation can sufficiently address heart failure. Engineered scaffolds, implantable patches, and injectable hydrogels are among the most promising solutions to restore cardiac function and coax regeneration; however, current biomaterials have yet to achieve ideal tissue regeneration and adequate integration due a mismatch of material physicochemical properties. Conductive fillers such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, metallic nanoparticles, and MXenes and conjugated polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and poly(3,4-ethylendioxythiophene) can possibly achieve optimal electrical conductivities for cardiac applications with appropriate suitability for tissue engineering approaches. Many studies have focused on the use of these materials in multiple fields, with promising effects on the regeneration of electrically active biological tissues such as orthopedic, neural, and cardiac tissue. In this review, we critically discuss the role of heart electrophysiology and the rationale toward the use of electroconductive biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering.

{"title": "Time-Lapsing Perfusion: Proof of Concept of a Novel Method to Study Drug Delivery in Whole Organs.", "abstract": "Perfusion is one of the most important processes maintaining organ health. From a computational perspective, however, perfusion is among the least-studied physiological processes of the heart. The recent development of novel nanoparticle-based targeted cardiac therapy calls for novel simulation methods that can provide insights into the distribution patterns of therapeutic agents within the heart tissue. Additionally, resolving the distribution patterns of perfusion is crucial for gaining a full understanding of the long-term impacts of cardiovascular diseases that can lead to adverse remodeling such as myocardial ischemia and heart failure. In this study, we have developed and used a, to our knowledge, novel particle-tracking-based method to simulate the perfusion-mediated distribution of nanoparticles or other solutes. To model blood flow through perfused tissue, we follow the approach of others and treat the tissue as a porous medium in a continuum model. Classically, solutes are modeled using reaction-advection-diffusion kinetics. However, because of the discrepancy of scales between advection and diffusion in blood vessels, this method becomes practically numerically unstable. Instead, we track a bolus of solutes or nanoparticles using particle tracking based purely on advection in arteries. In capillaries, we employ diffusion kinetics, using an effective diffusion coefficient to mimic capillary blood flow. We first demonstrate the numerical validity and computational efficiency of this method on a two-dimensional benchmark problem. Finally, we demonstrate how the method is used to visualize perfusion patterns of a healthy and ischemic human left ventricle geometry. The efficiency of the method allows for nanoparticle tracking over multiple cardiac cycles using a conventional laptop, providing a framework for the simulation of experimentally relevant timeframes to advance preclinical research.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2019-10-28", "authors": ["Alexandra KDiem", "KristianValen-Sendstad"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2019.09.029"}
{"title": "Isolation of Cardiomyocytes Undergoing Mitosis With Complete Cytokinesis.", "abstract": "Adult human cardiomyocytes do not complete cytokinesis despite passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle. As a result, polyploidization and multinucleation occur. To get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms surrounding division of cardiomyocytes, there is a crucial need for a technique to isolate cardiomyocytes that complete cell division/cytokinesis.\nMarkers of cell cycle progression based on DNA content cannot distinguish between mitotic cardiomyocytes that fail to complete cytokinesis from those cells that undergo true cell division. With the use of molecular beacons (MBs) targeting specific mRNAs, we aimed to identify truly proliferative cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting combined with MBs was performed to sort cardiomyocyte populations enriched for mitotic cells. Expressions of cell cycle specific genes were confirmed by means of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with gene signatures of cell cycle progression. We characterized the sorted groups by proliferation assays and time-lapse microscopy which confirmed the proliferative advantage of MB-positive cell populations relative to MB-negative and G2/M populations. Gene expression analysis revealed that the MB-positive cardiomyocyte subpopulation exhibited patterns consistent with the processes of nuclear division, chromosome segregation, and transition from M to G1 phase. The use of dual-MBs targeting \nThis study demonstrates a novel alternative to existing DNA content-based approaches for sorting cardiomyocytes with true mitotic potential that can be used to study the unique dynamics of cardiomyocyte nuclei during mitosis.

We studied cardiomyocyte ultrastructural remodeling of subcellular organelles by electronic microcopy in all groups.\nSHR group showed significant morphometric and stereological changes in mitochondria and subcellular organelles (cytoplasm and nucleus, myofibril structure, mitochondria structure, Z-Disk, intercalated disk, T-system and cystern), and also changes in the extracellular matrix (collagen) with respect to WKY group. Esmolol significantly improved the morphology and stereology mitochondrial, reduced the organelle phenotype abnormalities but no produced changes in the extracellular matrix with respect to SHR group. Interesantly, parameters of mitochondria (regularity factor, ellipsoidal form factor and density of volume), and all parameters of subcellular organelles returned to the normality in SHR-E.\nOur results show that left ventricular hypertrophy reversal after short-term treatment with esmolol is associated with reversal of subcellular organelle phenotype.", "journal": "Pharmacological reports : PR", "date": "2019-10-28", "authors": ["Bego\u00f1aQuintana-Villamandos", "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fasDelgado-Martos", "EmilioDelgado-Baeza"], "doi": "10.1016/j.pharep.2019.06.013"}
{"title": "Effect of Chronic Continuous Normobaric Hypoxia on Functional State of Cardiac Mitochondria and Tolerance of Isolated Rat Heart to Ischemia and Reperfusion: Role of \u00b5 and delta2 Opioid Receptors.", "abstract": "Chronic continuous normobaric hypoxia (CNH) increases cardiac tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and this effect is mediated via \u00b5 and delta2 opioid receptors (ORs) activation. CNH has also been shown to be cardioprotective in isolated rat heart. In this study, we hypothesize that this cardioprotective effect of CNH is mediated by activation of \u00b5 and delta2 ORs and preservation of mitochondrial function. Hearts from rats adapted to CNH (12 % oxygen) for 3 weeks were extracted, perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to 45 min of global ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion. Intervention groups were pretreated for 10 min with antagonists for different OR types: naloxone (300 nmol/l), the selective delta OR antagonist TIPP(psi) (30 nmol/l), the selective delta1 OR antagonist BNTX (1 nmol/l), the selective delta2 OR antagonist naltriben (1 nmol/l), the selective peptide \u00b5 OR antagonist CTAP (100 nmol/l) and the selective delta OR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (3 nmol/l). Creatine kinase activity in coronary effluent and cardiac contractile function were monitored to assess cardiac injury and functional impairment. Additionally, cardiac tissue was collected to measure ATP and to isolate mitochondria to measure respiration rate and calcium retention capacity. Adaptation to CNH decreased myocardial creatine kinase release during reperfusion and improved the postischemic recovery of contractile function. Additionally, CNH improved mitochondrial state 3 and uncoupled respiration rates, ADP/O, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium retention capacity and myocardial ATP level during reperfusion compared to the normoxic group. These protective effects were completely abolished by naloxone, TIPP(psi), naltriben, CTAP but not BNTX or nor-binaltorphimine. These results suggest that cardioprotection associated with adaptation to CNH is mediated by \u00b5 and delta2 opioid receptors activation and preservation of mitochondrial function.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2019-10-28", "authors": ["E SProkudina", "N VNaryzhnaya", "A VMukhomedzyanov", "A SGorbunov", "YZhang", "A SYaggi", "S YTsibulnikov", "E ANesterov", "Y BLishmanov", "M SSuleiman", "P ROeltgen", "L NMaslov"], "doi": "10.33549/physiolres.933945"}

The AMI rat model was prepared through ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular systolic diameter (LVDs), and left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd) of rats were determined using a color Doppler ultrasound system. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure the expression levels of lncRNA XIST, microRNA (miR)-449, and Notch1 in rat heart tissues in each group. Pathological morphology of rat heart tissues in each group was observed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Cell apoptosis in rat heart tissues was evaluated through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.\nCompared with those in Sham group, rats in Model group had significantly increased LVEDV, LVESV, LVDs, and LVDd. After transfection with lncRNA XIST siRNA, XIST level in rat heart tissues was remarkably declined in XIST siRNA group compared with that in Model group. According to HE staining results, the pathological injuries in rat heart tissues were greatly improved in XIST siRNA group compared with those in Model group. TUNEL staining results revealed that the apoptosis rate of cells in rat heart tissues in XIST siRNA group was markedly lower than that in Model group.

We report here that cardiac pacemaker cells can generate cardiomyocytes from fibroblasts in vitro. Sinoatrial node cells (SANCs) were isolated from adult guinea pig hearts and were cultured at relatively low cell densities. Within a week, a number of fibroblast-like cells were observed to gather around SANCs, and these formed spontaneously beating clusters with cardiomyocyte structures. The clusters expressed genes and proteins that are characteristic of atrial cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological blocking of pacemaker currents inhibited generation of action potentials, and the spontaneous beating were ceased by physically destroying a few central cells. Inhibition of beating during culture also hampered the cluster formation. Moreover, purified guinea pig\u00a0cardiac fibroblasts (GCFs)\u00a0expressed cardiac-specific proteins in co-culture with SANCs or in SANC-preconditioned culture medium under electrical stimulation.

{"title": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycan promotes fibroblast growth factor-2 function for ischemic heart repair.", "abstract": "It is well known that the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes angiogenesis after myocardial infarction (MI), but its biological functions decrease in the event of diffusion, enzymolysis, and weak binding with co-receptors in vivo. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are a major component of extracellular matrices and have been shown to regulate a wide range of cellular functions and bioprocesses by acting as a co-receptor for bFGF and affecting its bioactivities. However, the influence of HSPG on the function of bFGF after myocardial infarction is unknown. Here, exogenous HSPG along with bFGF was injected into the hearts of rats to deliver the angiogenic growth factor for ischemic heart repair following induced MI. The specific binding of HSPG with bFGF protein was demonstrated, which was about 6-fold stronger than the binding of bFGF with heparin. The biological mechanisms of HSPG binding with bFGF were further studied by cell adhesion assay, and assays of bFGF and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activities demonstrated that HSPG enhances cell adhesion, promotes the bioactivity of bFGF in angiogenesis, and protects bFGF from enzymolysis. Our results indicate that HSPG has potential clinical utility as a delivery agent for heparin-binding growth factors. Additionally, HSPG shows high binding affinities with different ECM proteins which also help to anchor bFGF to heart tissue. Therefore, extracellular proteins that mimic the bio-scaffold of the extracellular matrix could promote the activities of bFGF to facilitate ischemic heart repair.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2019-10-24", "authors": ["JiajiaShi", "CaixiaFan", "YanZhuang", "JieSun", "XianglinHou", "BingChen", "ZhifengXiao", "YanyanChen", "ZixuanZhan", "YannanZhao", "JianwuDai"], "doi": "10.1039/c9bm01336a"}
{"title": "A magnetics-based approach for fine-tuning afterload in engineered heart tissues.", "abstract": "Afterload plays important roles during heart development and disease progression, however, studying these effects in a laboratory setting is challenging. Current techniques lack the ability to precisely and reversibly alter afterload over time. Here, we describe a magnetics-based approach for achieving this control and present results from experiments in which this device was employed to sequentially increase afterload applied to rat engineered heart tissues (rEHTs) over a 7-day period. The contractile properties of rEHTs grown on control posts marginally increased over the observation period. The average post deflection, fractional shortening, and twitch velocities measured for afterload-affected tissues initially followed this same trend, but fell below control tissue values at high magnitudes of afterload. However, the average force, force production rate, and force relaxation rate for these rEHTs were consistently up to 3-fold higher than in control tissues. Transcript levels of hypertrophic or fibrotic markers and cell size remained unaffected by afterload, suggesting that the increased force output was not accompanied by pathological remodeling. Accordingly, the increased force output was fully reversed to control levels during a stepwise decrease in afterload over 4 hours. Afterload application did not affect systolic or diastolic tissue lengths, indicating that the afterload system was likely not a source of changes in preload strain. In summary, the afterload system developed herein is capable of fine-tuning EHT afterload while simultaneously allowing optical force measurements. Using this system, we found that small daily alterations in afterload can enhance the contractile properties of rEHTs, while larger increases can have temporary undesirable effects. Overall, these findings demonstrate the significant role that afterload plays in cardiac force regulation. Future studies with this system may allow for novel insights into the mechanisms that underlie afterload-induced adaptations in cardiac force development.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2019-10-23", "authors": ["Marita LRodriguez", "Tessa RWerner", "BenjaminBecker", "ThomasEschenhagen", "Marc NHirt"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01568\n10.1152/ajpheart.00799.2013\n10.1529/biophysj.107.124545\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.10.050\n10.1089/ten.a.2007.0092\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.029\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237206\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.12.052\n10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.09.028\n10.1002/stem.2036\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.07.003\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.11.058\n10.1002/ajmg.c.31366\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00318\n10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1152/ajpheart.01267.2006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0144309\n10.1161/CIRCEP.111.964783\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.943431\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.01.008\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1016/S0006-3495(69)86379-4\n10.1136/heart.84.1.59\n10.1016/j.echo.2016.01.002\n10.1002/uog.6137\n10.1111/j.1471-0528.1982.tb05037.x\n10.1016/S0735-1097(10)80282-7\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.01.005\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a059928\n10.1093/cvr/28.8.1199\n10.1161/01.RES.51.4.430\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016\n10.1017/CBO9780511623073\n10.1109/20.42430\n10.3109/15368378.2014.881744\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.07.004\n10.1088/0031-9155/31/7/006\n10.2131/jts.42.223\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.08.015\n10.1002/1522-2586(200007)12:1<122::AID-JMRI14>3.0.CO;2-C\n10.1371/journal.pone.0070416\n10.1002/bem.21875\n10.1155/2013/529173\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.02.020\n10.1042/bsr20160082\n10.1096/fj.04-2695fje\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.055\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1962.202.5.931\n10.1161/01.RES.12.6.597\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1963.204.4.604\n10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00215-0\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0341\n10.1172/JCI105214\n10.1161/01.RES.18.2.149\n10.1161/01.CIR.53.2.293\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.106.079426\n10.1113/jphysiol.1912.sp001553\n10.3109/13813455909072295\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1973.224.5.1195\n10.1152/ajpheart.00508.2012\n10.1038/nature15727\n10.1002/cnm.3147\n10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.06.132\n10.1016/0141-5425(82)90020-6\n10.1161/01.RES.28.6.611\n10.1080/10255842.2011.569885\n10.1161/01.RES.49.4.829\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.024\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0214"}
{"title": "Modular design of a tissue engineered pulsatile conduit using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Single ventricle heart defects (SVDs) are congenital disorders that result in a variety of complications, including increased ventricular mechanical strain and mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to heart failure without surgical intervention. Corrective surgery for SVDs are traditionally handled by the Fontan procedure, requiring a vascular conduit for completion. Although effective, current conduits are limited by their inability to aid in pumping blood into the pulmonary circulation. In this report, we propose an innovative and versatile design strategy for a tissue engineered pulsatile conduit (TEPC) to aid circulation through the pulmonary system by producing contractile force. Several design strategies were tested for production of a functional TEPC. Ultimately, we found that porcine extracellular matrix (ECM)-based engineered heart tissue (EHT) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and primary cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) wrapped around decellularized human umbilical artery (HUA) made an efficacious basal TEPC. Importantly, the TEPCs showed effective electrical and mechanical function. Initial pressure readings from our TEPC in vitro (0.68\u202fmmHg) displayed efficient electrical conductivity enabling them to follow electrical pacing up to a 2\u202fHz frequency. This work represents a proof of principle study for our current TEPC design strategy. Refinement and optimization of this promising TEPC design will lay the groundwork for testing the construct's therapeutic potential in the future. Together this work represents a progressive step toward developing an improved treatment for SVD patients. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Single Ventricle Cardiac defects (SVD) are a form of congenital disorder with a morbid prognosis without surgical intervention. These patients are treated through the Fontan procedure which requires vascular conduits to complete. Fontan conduits have been traditionally made from stable or biodegradable materials with no pumping activity. Here, we propose a tissue engineered pulsatile conduit (TEPC) for use in Fontan circulation to alleviate excess strain in SVD patients. In contrast to previous strategies for making a pulsatile Fontan conduit, we employ a modular design strategy that allows for the optimization of each component individually to make a standalone tissue.

{"title": "Induced cardiac progenitor cells repopulate decellularized mouse heart scaffolds and differentiate to generate cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Native myocardium has limited regenerative potential post injury. Advances in lineage reprogramming have provided promising cellular sources for regenerative medicine in addition to research applications. Recently we have shown that adult mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to expandable, multipotent, induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) by employing forced expression of five cardiac factors along with activation of canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT signaling. Here we aim to further characterize iCPCs by highlighting their safety, ease of attainability, and functionality within a three-dimensional cardiac extracellular matrix scaffold. Specifically, iCPCs did not form teratomas in contrast to embryonic stem cells when injected into immunodeficient mice. iCPC reprogramming was achieved in wild type mouse fibroblasts without requiring a cardiac-specific reporter, solely utilizing morphological changes to identify, clonally isolate, and expand iCPCs, thus increasing the versatility of this technology. iCPCs also show the ability to repopulate decellularized native heart scaffolds and differentiated into organized structures containing cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Optical mapping of recellularized scaffolds shows field-stimulated calcium transients that propagate across islands of reconstituted tissue and bipolar local stimulation demonstrates cell-cell coupling within scaffolds. Overall, iCPCs provide a readily attainable, scalable, safe, and functional cell source for a variety of application including drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative therapy.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta.

{"title": "Exogenous supplemental NAD+ protect myocardium against myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury in swine model.", "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Although ameliorative therapies against ischemic injury have remarkably reduced death rates among patients, they are inevitably complicated by reperfusion injury. Therefore, it is essential to explore other approaches to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Modulating the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a promising therapeutic strategy against some aging-related diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the role of NAD+ in a swine model of myocardial IRI. Fourteen Bama miniature pigs were subjected to 90 min transluminal balloon occlusion, and then randomly administrated with 20 mg/kg NAD+ or saline before reperfusion. Emission computerized tomography (ECT) was performed immediately and 4 weeks after reperfusion, and the cardiac tissues were analyzed histologically. In addition, the levels of cardiac function markers and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were also measured. NAD+ administration markedly reduced myocardial necrosis, enhanced glucose metabolism, and promoted cardiac function recovery. The extent of inflammation was also reduced in the NAD+ treated animals, and corresponded to less cardiac fibrosis and better ventricular compliance. Thus, NAD+ supplementation protected the myocardium from IRI, making it a promising therapeutic agent against acute myocardial ischemic disease.", "journal": "American journal of translational research", "date": "2019-10-22", "authors": ["XinrongZhai", "WenzhengHan", "MingWang", "ShaofengGuan", "XinkaiQu"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Effects of the combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin on cardiac function and inflammatory response in myocardial ischemia mice.", "abstract": "Ventricular remodeling is a major pathological process of normal heart failure. With the aging of society, poor diet control, social, psychological and other risk factors in our country, the incidence of myocardial infarction and hypertension is reported to increase yearly. Many treatment methods have effectively delayed the occurrence of ventricular remodeling. However, in order to prevent and delay the occurrence and development of ventricular remodeling, the new treatment strategy cannot be ignored.\nIn this study, we used male C57BL/6 mice (8\u202fweeks old), weight 23\u202fg-27\u202fg, SPF grade. According to the established methods of the research group, the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery (LAD) was used to make the model of myocardial ischemia, and which was evaluated by the change of EF value in mice. The experiment included seven groups: sham operation group, model group, metoprolol group, puerarin group, tanshinone IIA group, tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 group, tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:2 group. The changes of cardiac function in each group were observed by echocardiography and hemodynamics after the drug delivery cycle was 3d, 7d, 14d and 28d. Detection of 3d serum enzyme indexes LDH, CK and CK-MB by automatic biochemical analyzer. The expression of CD11b, F4/80, Ly6C in cardiac tissues were detected by flow cytometry at 3d and 7d. The expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF- \u03b1 in serum were detected by ELISA. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, iNOS and other related genes were detected by RT-PCR method. HE, Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining were used to observe the changes of myocardial histomorphology in mice. We also examined the effects of different drug treatments on the proliferation and function of Raw264.7 cells, H9C2 cells and HUVECs. Western blot examined the effects of different drug treatments on the expression of inflammatory pathway related proteins TLR4 and C/EBP-\u03b2.\n1. Echocardiographic results showed that with the prolongation of ischemic time, the ejection fraction of the model group, the shortening rate of the short axis of the left ventricle, the flow rate of the outflow tract were significantly decreased, and the structure of the ventricle was significantly changed. Hemodynamic tests showed that the maximum and maximum rate of decline in the post-ischemia model group were significantly reduced, with increased systolic and diastolic volume, and a decrease in pressure difference. After treatment with drugs, all groups improved, but tanshinone IIA: puerarin\u202f=\u202f1:1 group can significantly improve the above indicators after 28d of administration, which can effectively relieve the deterioration of cardiac function caused by acute myocardial infarction. 2. After administration for 3 and 7\u202fdays, the inflammatory cell CD11b monocytes and the F4/80 phenotype macrophages in heart tissue were detected by flow cytometry, and it was found that tanshinone IIA: puerarin\u202f=\u202f1:1 can inhibit the release of inflammatory cells. The results of RT-PCR showed that the tanshinone IIA: puerarin\u202f=\u202f1:1 group significantly improved the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and iNOS. In the immunohistochemical analysis of iNOS and Arg-1, the tanshinone IIA and puerarin 1:1 treatment group was able to inhibit the expression of M1 macrophages in the early stage of inflammation and promote the expression of M2 macrophages. 3. The cardiac index increased significantly and the serum TGF-\u03b2 increased after 28d. The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin could significantly reduce these indexes. HE, Masson, Sirius red and immunohistochemical staining were found in the combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin can significantly reduce the structure of acute ischemic myocardial cell damage and interstitial edema, reduce collagen synthesis, and fibroblasts release, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and heart remodeling. 4. MTT assay showed a significantly greater proliferation of above two cells types treated with tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 and more nodes and meshes were found in tanshinone IIA: puerarin =1:1 group compared with other groups. 5. The combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin could regulate inflammation through inhibiting the expression of TLR4 protein, but up-regulating the expression of C/EBP-\u03b2 protein.\nThe combination of tanshinone IIA and puerarin inhibits the immersion of inflammatory cells. Improving hemodynamics by improving cardiac function, reducing the destruction of cardiac myocytes, reducing collagen synthesis, inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling.

The study aimed to evaluate the transcriptional levels of the natriuretic peptides (NP), endothelin (ET)-1, adrenomedullin (ADM), their receptors and long non-coding (Lnc) RNA MIAT, MALAT-1, CARMEN and XIST in rat cardiac tissue as cardiovascular biomarkers of aging. Three groups of male Wistar rats were studied: A (n\u202f=\u202f6; young), B (n\u202f=\u202f13; adult), C (n\u202f=\u202f10; old). Total RNA was extracted from left ventricle and analyzed by Real-Time PCR. Echocardiographic and histological analyses were performed. A significant increase of Atrial NP (ANP) and Brain NP (BNP) mRNA was observed in C while C-type NP (CNP) remained in a steady-state in B and C; ET-1 mRNA increased significantly as a function of age. Any difference was observed for NP receptors. ETA expression was statistically lower in B than A while ETB were similar in all the three groups. The ADM showed an opposite trend to that of the other peptides decreasing significantly as a function of age and presenting a counter-regulation of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP)-2. LncRNA transcripts decreased significantly as a function of age except for XIST. ADM and LncRNA trend suggest that the animals are subjected to \"successful aging\" as also confirmed by histological analysis. Applying a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only LnANP (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) and LnADM (p\u202f=\u202f0.023) resulted significantly associated with aging identifying them, for the first time, as independent markers of aging.

{"title": "Nanogels for regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Nanogels have been widely explored for drug delivery, but their applications in the tissue engineering field are still quite recent. Regenerative medicine also demands controlled delivery of growth factors and other active substances able to promote cell adhesion and guide cell differentiation and tissue formation. Moreover, nanogels could be added to tissue scaffolds for modifying their inner architecture, texture and mechanical properties, which are critical for regulating cell behavior. This review aims to provide an insight into the different roles that nanogels may play for improving tissue regeneration. Last decade literature has been carefully analyzed with a focus on in vivo outcomes. After an introductory section to nanogels, relevant examples of their performance for skin and bone tissue regeneration applications are discussed. Healing of chronic wounds and critical size bone fractures may significantly improve thanks to the use of nanogels solely or in combination with scaffolds. Nanogel roles in regenerating vessels, cardiac tissue, urothelium and urethral muscle tissue are also presented. Overall, the information gathered in the review clearly highlights the relevance of multidisciplinary approaches to design nanogels that can face up to the needs of the regenerative medicine.

We evaluated FLNC variants in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) and investigated the disease mechanism at a molecular level.\n120 gene-elusive ACM patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) were screened by whole exome sequencing. Fixed cardiac tissue from FLNC variant carriers who had died suddenly was investigated by histology and immunohistochemistry.\nNovel or rare FLNC variants, four null and five variants of unknown significance, were identified in nine ACM probands (7.5%). In FLNC null variant carriers (including family members, n\u202f=\u202f16) Task Force diagnostic electrocardiogram repolarization/depolarization abnormalities were uncommon (19%), echocardiography was normal in 69%, while 56% had >500 ventricular ectopics/24\u202fh or ventricular tachycardia on Holter and 67% had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI).

Blocking LFA-1 has reduced or aggravated inflammation depending on the inflammation model. To investigate the effect of LFA-1 in myocarditis, mice with experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) were treated with a function blocking anti-LFA-1 antibody from day 1 of disease until day 21, the peak of inflammation. Cardiac inflammation was evaluated by measuring infiltration of leukocytes into the inflamed cardiac tissue using histology and flow cytometry and was assessed by analysis of the heart weight/body weight ratio. LFA-1 antibody treatment severely enhanced leukocyte infiltration, in particular infiltration of CD11b+ monocytes, F4/80+ macrophages, CD4+ T cells, Ly6G+ neutrophils, and CD133+ progenitor cells at peak of inflammation which was accompanied by an increased heart weight/body weight ratio.

This shortcoming results in mechanically invasive devices and nonnatural signal transduction across cells and tissues. Moreover, resolving heterocellular electrical communication in vivo is extremely limited due to the invasiveness of traditional interconnected electrical probes. In this paper, we present a cell-silicon hybrid that integrates native cellular behavior (e.g., gap junction formation and biosignal processing) with nongenetically enabled photosensitivity. This hybrid configuration allows interconnect-free cellular modulation with subcellular spatial resolution for bioelectric studies. Specifically, we hybridize cardiac myofibroblasts with silicon nanowires and use these engineered hybrids to synchronize the electrical activity of cardiomyocytes, studying heterocellular bioelectric coupling in vitro. Thereafter, we inject the engineered myofibroblasts into heart tissues and show their ability to seamlessly integrate into contractile tissues in vivo.

{"title": "Homeobox gene Meis1 modulates cardiovascular regeneration.", "abstract": "Regeneration of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (three major lineages of cardiac tissues) following myocardial infarction is the critical step to recover the function of the damaged heart. Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Meis1) was first discovered in leukemic mice in 1995 and its biological function has been extensively studied in leukemia, hematopoiesis, the embryonic pattering of body axis, eye development and various genetic diseases, such as restless leg syndrome. It was found that Meis1 is highly associated with Hox genes and their cofactors to exert its regulatory effects on multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Recently with the advent of bioinformatics, biochemical methods and advanced genetic engineering tools, new function of Meis1 has been found to be involved in the cell cycle regulation of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. For example, inhibition of Meis1 expression increases the proliferative capacity of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, whereas overexpression of Meis1 results in the reduction in the length of cardiomyocyte proliferative window. Interestingly, downregulation of one of the circular RNAs, which acts downstream of Meis1 in the cardiomyocytes, promotes angiogenesis and restores the myocardial blood supply, thus reinforcing better regeneration of the damaged heart. It appears that Meis1 may play double roles in modulating proliferation and regeneration of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells post-myocardial infarction. In this review, we propose to summarize the major findings of Meis1 in modulating fetal development and adult abnormalities, especially focusing on the recent discoveries of Meis1 in controlling the fate of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells.", "journal": "Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "date": "2019-10-19", "authors": ["SwagatikaPaul", "XiaonanZhang", "Jia-QiangHe"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.10.003\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2007.06.023\n10.1172/JCI99659\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.08.127\n10.1161/JAHA.112.005652\n10.1038/nature12054\n10.1387/ijdb.072430nm\n10.1038/nrg1723\n10.1371/journal.pone.0058857\n10.1038/leu.2012.356\n10.3324/haematol.2010.027698\n10.1101/gad.1619407\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.004\n10.1182/blood-2012-05-432260\n10.3324/haematol.2017.177485\n10.1101/gad.1602107\n10.1182/blood-2002-08-2484\n10.1038/sj.onc.1204174\n10.1038/46580\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e318211c366\n10.1016/j.sleep.2016.08.002\n10.1242/dev.122176\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175489\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600038\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.03.029\n10.1093/nar/25.21.4173\n10.1007/s00239-006-0023-0\n10.1101/gad.1007602\n10.1002/dvdy.24016\n10.1242/dev.02298\n10.1074/jbc.273.14.7941\n10.1016/s0039-128x(96)00157-2\n10.1007/s11033-017-4126-z\n10.1038/ng0296-149\n10.1128/mcb.19.4.3051\n10.1182/blood-2004-12-4664\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302023\n10.1002/dvg.22833\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.07.011\n10.1002/jez.1402510210\n10.1067/mnc.2001.118924\n10.1038/sj.mn.7800173\n10.1038/74651\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.035\n10.1242/dmm.006791\n10.1186/gm299\n10.1002/wdev.312\n10.1038/nature12111\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.075\n10.1111/j.1439-0264.2008.00894.x\n10.1007/s10456-005-9016-7\n10.1016/j.devcel.2013.02.011\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.12.017\n10.1242/jcs.00969\n10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.048\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038361\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1001304\n10.1136/jmg.2010.087858\n10.1101/gr.166751.113\n10.7554/eLife.11627\n10.3390/jdb4010001\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.07.004\n10.1096/fj.201801330RR\n10.1101/cshperspect.a013847\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.02.008\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.07.035\n10.1016/j.drudis.2014.12.018\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002279\n10.1007/s11033-018-4247-z\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.08.065\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.019357\n10.1002/iub.1456\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00959\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.08.030\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.09.106\n10.1073/pnas.1406508111\n10.1073/pnas.231115398"}

Platforms utilizing hybrid hydrogels containing various types of conductive nanoparticles have been a critical tool for constructing engineered cardiac tissues with outstanding mechanical integrity and improved electrophysiological properties. However, there has been no attempt to directly compare the efficacy of these hybrid hydrogels and decipher the mechanisms behind how these platforms differentially regulate cardiomyocyte behavior. Here, we employed gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels containing three different types of carbon-based nanoparticles: carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced GO (rGO), to investigate the influence of these hybrid scaffolds on the structural organization and functionality of cardiomyocytes. Using immunofluorescent staining for assessing cellular organization and proliferation, we showed that electrically conductive scaffolds (CNT- and rGO-GelMA compared to relatively nonconductive GO-GelMA) played a significant role in promoting desirable morphology of cardiomyocytes and elevated the expression of functional cardiac markers, while maintaining their viability. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that these engineered cardiac tissues showed distinct cardiomyocyte phenotypes and different levels of maturity based on the substrate (CNT-GelMA: ventricular-like, GO-GelMA: atrial-like, and rGO-GelMA: ventricular/atrial mixed phenotypes). Through analysis of gene-expression patterns, we uncovered that the engineered cardiac tissues matured on CNT-GelMA and native cardiac tissues showed comparable expression levels of maturation markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that engineered cardiac tissues matured on CNT-GelMA have increased functionality through integrin-mediated mechanotransduction (", "journal": "ACS nano", "date": "2019-10-18", "authors": ["JunminLee", "VijayanManoharan", "LouisCheung", "SeungkyuLee", "Byung-HyunCha", "PeterNewman", "RaziehFarzad", "ShreyaMehrotra", "KaizhenZhang", "FazalKhan", "MasoumehGhaderi", "Yi-DongLin", "SairaAftab", "PooriaMostafalu", "MarioMiscuglio", "JoanLi", "Biman BMandal", "Mohammad AsifHussain", "Kai-TakWan", "Xiaowu ShirleyTang", "AliKhademhosseini", "Su RyonShin"], "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.9b03050"}

{"title": "Finite element modelling of discontinuous action potential propagation in larval zebrafish and human cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Recently the larval zebrafish has emerged as a model organism which is used to assist in the studies of human cardiac electrophysiology. Although they share many similar electrophysiological characteristics, it has been found that the conduction velocity (CV) of action potential (AP) propagation in larval zebrafish heart is up to two orders of magnitude smaller than in the adult mammalian heart. To address this difference, we have developed three dimensional discrete models of larval zebrafish ventricular fibres (LZVF) in order to simulate AP propagation, taking into account the cellular nature of the tissues and intercellular conduction via gap junctions. Since our ultimate goal is to simulate a whole larval zebrafish heart, we have used the phenomenological Fitzhugh Nagumo (FHN) equations to describe transmembrane currents, and manually adjusted the FHN parameters, to fit published AP shapes for larval zebrafish ventricular cells. This has the benefit of reduced computational load compared to approaches based on biophysical ion current models. We have created models for 48 and 72\u2009h post fertilisation LZVF tissue using published AP and cell size data for zebrafish embryos and used mammalian values for passive electrical parameters. Using the gap junction resistivity per myocyte as an adjustable parameter, we were able to obtain CVs in both of our LZVF models which agree with experimental observations. In order to validate our approach, we have applied it to a human ventricular fibre (HVF) model similar in structure and parameters to other models of the mammalian heart, but adjusting the FHN parameters to fit published AP shapes for human ventricular cells. We find good agreement with the human models.

{"title": "Quantification of Contractile Dynamic Complexities Exhibited by Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes Using Nonlinear Dimensional Analysis.", "abstract": "Understanding the complexity of biological signals has been gaining widespread attention due to increasing knowledge on the nonlinearity that exists in these systems. Cardiac signals are known to exhibit highly complex dynamics, consisting of high degrees of interdependency that regulate the cardiac contractile functions. These regulatory mechanisms are important to understand for the development of novel in vitro cardiac systems, especially with the exponential growth in deriving cardiac tissue directly from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). This work describes a unique analytical approach that integrates linear amplitude and frequency analysis of physical cardiac contraction, with nonlinear analysis of the contraction signals to measure the signals' complexity. We generated contraction motion waveforms reflecting the physical contraction of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and implemented these signals to nonlinear analysis to compute the capacity and correlation dimensions.

{"title": "Shikonin attenuates sympathetic remodeling in chronic heart failure mice via regulating miR-124.", "abstract": "Shikonin is a naphthoquinone compound extracted from the root of Lithospermum with various pharmacological activities. Sympathetic neural remodeling greatly contributes to chronic heart failure. Growing evidence has identified a critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of cardiac biological processes. This study aimed to verify whether shikonin could attenuate sympathetic neural remodeling and explore the possible regulatory role of miRNAs in this process.\nShikonin was administered to mice after transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to assess the expression of TAC-induced sympathetic remodeling-related proteins.\nTAC-induced expression of the sympathetic remodeling-related proteins, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), growth associated protein 43 (GAP43), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and nerve growth factor (NGF), was significantly decreased in cardiac tissues. MiR-124 expression significantly increased after heart failure and decreased after shikonin treatment. An adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vector was packaged and used to transfect myocardial tissues of aortic-constricted mice with miR-124, resulting in increased heart miR-124 levels and inhibition of the effects of shikonin on sympathetic neural remodeling. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the density of TH-, GAP43-, and ChAT-positive nerves was significantly increased in aortic-constricted mice after transfection with AAV9-miR-124.\nOur data demonstrate that shikonin administration prevents sympathetic neural remodeling in mice with TAC-induced heart failure. The effects of shikonin on heart failure may be partly due to miR-124-mediated attenuation of sympathetic remodeling.

The most common conditions that lead to HF are coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valve disorders, high blood pressure, and cardiomyopathy. Due to the limited regenerative capacity of the heart, the only curative therapy currently available is heart transplantation. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of novel regenerative strategies to repair the injured myocardium, replace damaged valves, and treat occluded coronary arteries. Recent advances in manufacturing technologies have resulted in the precise fabrication of 3D fiber scaffolds with high architectural control that can support and guide new tissue growth, opening exciting new avenues for repair of the human heart. This review discusses the recent advancements in the novel research field of fiber patterning manufacturing technologies for cardiac tissue engineering (cTE) and to what extent these technologies could meet the requirements of the highly organized and structured cardiac tissues.

Attempts to regenerate the complicated heart-tissue alignment has rarely featured macroscale 3D constructs required for myocardial tissue engineering. The feasibility of engineered scaffolds with micro/macro-architecture for guiding spatial cell alignment following complex patterns is reported. The scaffold is composed of stackable dual-structured layers with linear micro-ridge/groove patterns and macro-through-hole arrays, which enable tailorable anisotropy and interconnective free space. When human mesenchymal stem cells are seeded on the scaffold, well-organized spreading alignment showing the precise control in cellular orientation is significantly introduced over nonpatterned controls. Moreover, spatial cell distribution in the scaffold and directional changes of the layered linear patterns that made cell alignment orientations turning accordingly are observed, leading to the complex 3D pattern reconstruction of cellular alignment resembling natural myocardial tissue.

Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee\u2009+\u2009honey (GH) for 18\u00a0months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic acids, and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, G-protein mediated events, phospholipid metabolism, and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic acid, ellagic acid, and arachidonic acid components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered metabolic profile following long-term AR administration.

However, recently its application has been limited due to the cardiotoxic effects it has caused. Severe cardiotoxicity of DOX causes cardiac hypertrophy that may lead to heart failure. It has previously been demonstrated that CACNA1H is re-expressed in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of CACNA1H in DOX-induced acute cardiotoxicity, and to investigate its possible underlying mechanisms of action involved.\nFirstly, DOX-induced cardiac injury and changes in the expression of CACNA1H were evaluated. We explored the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in mice that underwent DOX-induced cardiac injury. Next, to explore the role of CACNA1H in this process, we evaluated the changes in DOX-induced cardiac injury and ER stress after treatment with the CACNA1H specific inhibitor ABT-639. Next, we used ER stress inhibitor UR906 to verify the role of ER stress in DOX induced cardiotoxicity in H9C2 cells.\nDOX-treatment caused acute heart injury, leading to a decrease in cardiac function in mice, an increase in apoptosis of cardiac myocytes, and a significant increase in the expression level of CACNA1H in heart tissue. Next, mice were treated with CACNA1H inhibitor ABT-639 and we demonstrated that it partly protects myocardial function and reduces myocardial cell apoptosis. In addition, our data indicated that CACNA1H may play a role in alleviating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by reducing the severity of ER stress because the use of ABT-639 significantly changed ER stress-related proteins, including p-PERK, PERK, CHOP, GRP78, ATF6, and ATF4. Furthermore, we found that the use of ER stress inhibitor UR906 in H9C2 cells significantly alleviated the increased expression of ER stress related proteins and apoptosis related proteins caused by DOX, and meanwhile reduced the degree of intracellular oxidative stress and intracellular calcium ion concentration.\nCACNA1H inhibitors significantly alleviated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and apoptosis induced by ER stress.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2019-10-04", "authors": ["JunxiaHu", "QiWu", "ZhiweiWang", "JunmouHong", "RuoshiChen", "BowenLi", "ZhipengHu", "XiaopingHu", "MinZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109475"}

In this study, we designed 4 different ventricular models mimicking wave propagation in cardiac tissues under normal, myocardial infarction (MI), MI with random fibrosis and MI with gradient fibrosis conditions. Simulation results of ideal square tissues indicate that vulnerable windows (VWs) of random and gradient fibrosis distributions are similar with low levels of fibrosis.

In this study, small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles formulated with a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) nanomaterial were applied to the injured heart of zebrafish. The distribution of nanoparticles in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages and leukocytes was quantitatively analyzed with precision at the cell level by using transgenic models. Based on the distribution characteristics, gene silencing effects in a specific group of cells were analyzed to illustrate how siRNA nanoparticles could get potent gene silencing in different cells in vivo. The results elucidated the heterogeneous distribution of siRNA nanoparticles and how nanoparticles could be efficient despite the significant difference in cellular uptake efficiency in different cells.

{"title": "Synchronization-based reconstruction of electromechanical wave dynamics in elastic excitable media.", "abstract": "The heart is an elastic excitable medium, in which mechanical contraction is triggered by nonlinear waves of electrical excitation, which diffuse rapidly through the heart tissue and subsequently activate the cardiac muscle cells to contract. These highly dynamic excitation wave phenomena have yet to be fully observed within the depths of the heart muscle, as imaging technology is unable to penetrate the tissue and provide panoramic, three-dimensional visualizations necessary for adequate study. As a result, the electrophysiological mechanisms that are associated with the onset and progression of severe heart rhythm disorders such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation remain insufficiently understood. Here, we present a novel synchronization-based data assimilation approach with which it is possible to reconstruct excitation wave dynamics within the volume of elastic excitable media by observing spatiotemporal deformation patterns, which occur in response to excitation. The mechanical data are assimilated in a numerical replication of the measured elastic excitable system, and within this replication, the data drive the intrinsic excitable dynamics, which then coevolve and correspond to a reconstruction of the original dynamics. We provide a numerical proof-of-principle and demonstrate the performance of the approach by recovering even complicated three-dimensional scroll wave patterns, including vortex filaments of electrical excitation from within a deformable bulk tissue with fiber anisotropy. In the future, the reconstruction approach could be combined with high-speed imaging of the heart's mechanical contractions to estimate its electrophysiological activity for diagnostic purposes.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2019-10-03", "authors": ["JanLebert", "JanChristoph"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5101041"}

We show that the characteristic length ranges from 40 to 20\u00a0cm during one-to-one responses and it decreases to a specific value of about 3\u00a0cm at the transition from period-doubling bifurcation to fibrillation. We further show that during fibrillation, the characteristic length is about 1\u00a0cm. Another significant outcome of our analysis is the finding of a constitutive phenomenological law obtained from a nonlinear fitting of experimental data which relates the conduction velocity restitution curve with the characteristic length of the system.

{"title": "The Role of Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Extracellular Vesicles in Cardiac Cell Death.", "abstract": "Exosomes play a crucial role in the progression of infectious diseases, as exosome release and biogenesis are affected by external factors, such as pathogenic infections. Pyrogens may aide in the progression of diseases by triggering inflammation, endothelial cell injury, and arterial plaque rupture, all of which can lead to acute coronary disease, resulting in cardiac tissue death and the onset of a cardiac event (CE). To better understand the effects of Gram-negative bacterial infections on exosome composition and biogenesis, we examined exosome characteristics after treatment of AC16 human cardiomyocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which served as a model system for Gram-negative bacterial infection. Using increasing doses (0, 0.1, 1, or 10 \u00b5g) of LPS, we showed that treatment with LPS substantially altered the composition of AC16-derived exosomes. Both the relative size and the quantity (particles/mL) of exosomes were decreased significantly at all tested concentrations of LPS treatment compared to the untreated group. In addition, LPS administration reduced the expression of exosomal proteins that are related to exosomal biogenesis. Conversely, we observed an increase in immunomodulators present after LPS administration.

{"title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Cardiac Remodeling and Regeneration in Physical Exercise.", "abstract": "Regular physical activity with aerobic and muscle-strengthening training protects against the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular disease and can improve cardiac function in heart failure patients. In the past decade significant advances have been made in identifying mechanisms of cardiomyocyte re-programming and renewal including an enhanced exercise-induced proliferational capacity of cardiomyocytes and its progenitor cells. Various intracellular mechanisms mediating these positive effects on cardiac function have been found in animal models of exercise and will be highlighted in this review. 1) activation of extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), EGFR/JNK/SP-1, nitric oxide (NO)-signaling, and extracellular vesicles; 2) gene expression modulation via microRNAs (miR), in particular via miR-17-3p and miR-222; and 3) modulation of cardiac cellular metabolism and mitochondrial adaption. Understanding the cellular mechanisms, which generate an exercise-induced cardioprotective cellular phenotype with physiological hypertrophy and enhanced proliferational capacity may give rise to novel therapeutic targets.

However, the anti-inflammatory effects of As-IV following LPS stimulation in mice and H9C2 cardiomyocytes remain unclear. The present study was designed to explore the mechanism of action of As-IV. MATERIAL AND METHODS In vivo, C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: the control group, the LPS group (10 mg/kg), and 3 LPS groups receiving different doses of As-IV (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg). The protective effect of As-IV on LPS-stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes was evaluated in vitro. Cardiac function was detected by echocardiography, and H&E staining was used to evaluate morphologic changes. Cardiomyocyte viability was detected by MTT assay. ELISA was used to detect free fatty acid (FFA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1\u00df\u00a0(IL-1\u00df), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in mouse serum and in cell supernatant. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) contents in myocardial tissues and cells were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. ATP5D and TLR4/NF-kappaB/PPARalpha signaling pathway proteins (TLR4, NF-kappaB, p65, and PPARalpha) were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS As-IV significantly improved cardiac function, myocardial cell viability, and pathological changes and reduced FFA, IL-1\u00df, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels. The ATP/AMP ratio in the cardiac tissues of mice and in H9C2 cardiomyocytes was increased compared to that in the LPS group. In addition, As-IV enhanced ATP synthase and PPARalpha protein expression. In H9C2 cardiomyocytes, the p65-specific inhibitor BAY11-7082 exerted similar effects as As-IV.

{"title": "The inhibitory role of Chinese materia medica in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and underlying molecular mechanism.", "abstract": "Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved suicide process. It plays critical roles in the development and homeostasis of cardiac tissues. However, excessively stimulated apoptotic activity induced by a myriad of deleterious stimuli can result in too much cardiomyocyte death. The regenerative potential of the adult cardiomyocytes is limited. The cardiomyocyte loss cannot be compensated by efficient cell proliferation. It inevitably leads to various heart diseases. Therefore, the inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis is an important therapeutic strategy for heart diseases. Chinese materia medica (CMM) has more than 2000 years of history and provides effective adjuvant therapeutic strategies for heart disease at the clinical level. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of CMM on heart diseases have been a major focus of recent research. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that CMM can up-regulate the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and down-regulate the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins to inhibit apoptotic activity, thereby suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to harmful stimuli. The inhibitory effects of CMM on apoptotic activity are mediated by the transduction of intracellular signaling.

For the treatment of cancer many anticancer drugs have been developed but, unfortunately, their potential cardiotoxic side effects raised serious concerns about their use among clinicians. Cyclophosphamide is a potent anticancer and immunosuppressant drug but its use is limited due to cardiotoxic side effect. Thus, there is a need for the development of certain drug which can reduce cardiotoxicity and can be used as an adjuvant therapy in cancer patients. In this direction we, therefore planned to evaluate nerolidol (NER) for its cardioprotective potential against cyclophosphamide-induced cardiotoxicity in Swiss Albino mice.

{"title": "Tet inactivation disrupts YY1 binding and long-range chromatin interactions during embryonic heart development.", "abstract": "Tet-mediated DNA demethylation plays an important role in shaping the epigenetic landscape and chromatin accessibility to control gene expression. While several studies demonstrated pivotal roles of Tet in regulating embryonic development, little is known about their functions in heart development.

We find that cardiac-specific deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 in mice (Tet2/3-DKO) leads to ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) with embryonic lethality. Single-cell RNA-seq analyses reveal a reduction in cardiomyocyte numbers and transcriptional reprogramming in cardiac tissues upon Tet2/3 depletion. Impaired DNA demethylation and reduced chromatin accessibility in Tet2/3-DKO mice further compromised Ying-yang1 (YY1) binding to its genomic targets, and perturbed high-order chromatin organization at key genes involved in heart development. Our studies provide evidence of the physiological role of Tet in regulating DNA methylation dynamics and chromatin organization during early heart development.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2019-09-22", "authors": ["ShaohaiFang", "JiaLi", "YangXiao", "MinjungLee", "LeiGuo", "WeiHan", "TingtingLi", "Matthew CHill", "TingtingHong", "WilliamMo", "RangXu", "PingZhang", "FenWang", "JiangChang", "YubinZhou", "DeqiangSun", "James FMartin", "YunHuang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-12325-z\n10.1073/pnas.1510510112\n10.1038/nature20095\n10.1038/nature10443\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.003\n10.1038/s41588-017-0002-y\n10.1126/science.1170116\n10.1126/science.1210944\n10.1126/science.1210597\n10.1038/nature09586\n10.1038/ng.3522\n10.1021/jacs.7b01459\n10.1093/nar/gky063\n10.1056/NEJMoa1408617\n10.1126/science.aag1381\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.12.037\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.302752\n10.1038/ncomms6288\n10.1038/s41467-017-02762-z\n10.1038/ncomms12418\n10.1080/15592294.2014.998536\n10.1093/jn/136.7.1774\n10.1097/00001648-200107000-00014\n10.1038/pr.2014.128\n10.1038/nature13992\n10.1038/nbt.1630\n10.1038/nature12052\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008888\n10.1126/science.1212483\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.07.010\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.06.003\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.06.001\n10.1073/pnas.1112317108\n10.1182/blood-2010-12-325241\n10.1002/gene.10022\n10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044336\n10.1038/nm.3046\n10.1038/ncb3280\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.061\n10.1038/nprot.2012.103\n10.1038/nature10102\n10.1038/ng.3610\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.259259\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.025\n10.1126/science.aad3346\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.11.008\n10.1016/j.tibs.2018.03.006\n10.1038/nmeth.3999\n10.1101/gr.160374.113\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.300947\n10.1002/dvdy.24263\n10.1038/sj.onc.1209080\n10.1038/ng.3868\n10.1074/jbc.M114.605881\n10.1038/45797\n10.1016/j.devcel.2018.03.019\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.082\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1038/nbt.3192\n10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r38\n10.1038/nmeth.2688\n10.1038/nprot.2018.015\n10.1186/s13059-015-0831-x\n10.1038/nmeth.2440\n10.1126/science.1181369\n10.1038/nmeth.3542"}

Here we report identification of circRNA transcripts that are differentially expressed in post myocardial infarction (MI) mouse hearts including circFndc3b which is significantly down-regulated in the post-MI hearts. Notably, the human circFndc3b ortholog is also significantly down-regulated in cardiac tissues of ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. Overexpression of circFndc3b in cardiac endothelial cells increases vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression and enhances their angiogenic activity and reduces cardiomyocytes and endothelial cell apoptosis. Adeno-associated virus 9 -mediated cardiac overexpression of circFndc3b in post-MI hearts reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis, enhances neovascularization and improves left ventricular functions. Mechanistically, circFndc3b interacts with the RNA binding protein Fused in Sarcoma to regulate VEGF expression and signaling. These findings highlight a physiological role for circRNAs in cardiac repair and indicate that modulation of circFndc3b expression may represent a potential strategy to promote cardiac function and remodeling after MI.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2019-09-22", "authors": ["Venkata Naga SrikanthGarikipati", "Suresh KumarVerma", "ZhongjianCheng", "DongmingLiang", "May MTruongcao", "MariaCimini", "YujiaYue", "GraceHuang", "ChunlinWang", "CindyBenedict", "YanTang", "VandanaMallaredy", "JessicaIbetti", "LaurelGrisanti", "Sarah MSchumacher", "ErheGao", "SudarsanRajan", "Jeremy EWilusz", "DavidGoukassian", "Steven RHouser", "Walter JKoch", "RajKishore"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-019-11777-7\n10.1002/emmm.201100191\n10.1002/stem.2121\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.09.009\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305990\n10.1038/nature11928\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030733\n10.1261/rna.035667.112\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.03.020\n10.3389/fnmol.2016.00025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151753\n10.1126/science.1238522\n10.1038/ncomms11215\n10.1038/srep30919\n10.1038/nbt.2890\n10.1016/j.molcel.2014.08.019\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.017\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.021\n10.1038/cr.2017.31\n10.1093/nar/gkw027\n10.1080/15476286.2017.1279788\n10.1038/nn.3975\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.306319\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehx501.P440\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151753\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.06.040\n10.4161/cc.20121\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.01.040\n10.1126/science.aam8526\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.248369\n10.1093/cvr/cvx052\n10.1038/nature11993\n10.1080/15476286.2015.1128065\n10.1016/j.molcel.2017.05.022\n10.1101/cshperspect.a012328\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.06.015\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.07.007\n10.1159/000445617\n10.1186/s13059-014-0409-z\n10.1080/15476286.2017.1279788\n10.1038/srep31313\n10.1097/JTO.0b013e31816bce65\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3463\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210547\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210500\n10.1177/1947601911423031\n10.1073/pnas.091415198\n10.1038/nrg3162\n10.1101/gad.270421.115\n10.1016/j.omtn.2018.08.008\n10.1128/JVI.76.2.791-801.2002\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.09.009\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.1.H429\n10.1007/s00395-014-0422-0"}

The I/R model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and then recanalizing it. PFL siRNAs were injected intravenously into the tail vein of rats in I/R + PFL siRNA group to construct a PFL knockout model. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test was used to detect the infarction area of each group. Echocardiography was adopted to measure the ejection fraction [EF (%)] and fraction shortening [FS (%)] of rats in each group. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied to detect the morphological changes in myocardial cells in each group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was conducted to detect the apoptosis levels of myocardial cells and fibroblasts in heart tissues in each group. Meanwhile, the protein expression levels of apoptosis-related genes, Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), and Bcl-2, were measured via Western blotting. Also, the expression level of heat shock protein 20 (HSP-20) in the heart of three groups of rats was examined using immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the effects of PFL siRNAs on the expression level of HSP-20 were detected via Western blotting.\nPFL siRNAs could significantly improve I/R-induced cardiac insufficiency in rats, thus increasing EF (%) and FS (%) (p<0.05). Besides, PFL siRNAs could remarkably inhibit cardiac infarction caused by I/R injury and reduce the infarction area from (59.54\u00b13.45)% to (24.85\u00b11.30)% (p<0.05). H&E staining results manifested that, compared with those in I/R group, the cardiac myofilament was better in alignment, degradation and necrosis were milder, and cell edema was notably reduced in I/R + PFL siRNA group. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting results showed that PFL siRNAs could remarkably reverse the decrease in the HSP-20 expression caused by I/R (p<0.05).\nWe found that PFL knockdown can significantly improve the myocardial injury caused by I/R and improve the cardiac function in rats. The mechanism may be related to the activation of HSP-20 by PFL siRNAs. Therefore, PFL is expected to become a new target for the treatment of MI.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2019-09-21", "authors": ["R-LYin", "HYou", "Y-MWu", "F-LYe", "W-XGu", "JShen"], "doi": "10.26355/eurrev_201909_18885"}

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) may be a new adjuvant therapy against the progression of DCM and its underlying microvascular pathology.\nDiabetes was induced in Wistar rats with a high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin injections, and ucOC was upregulated after warfarin administration in the treated group. After 8 weeks, cardiac functions were assessed using a Langendorff apparatus. Cardiac tissue samples were also extracted to assess the ucOC receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for histopathological studies.\nBoth the systolic and the diastolic dysfunction observed in the DCM group were significantly improved after the increase in ucOC blood levels. Significant improvement in VEGF and CD31 expression after warfarin injection was associated with increased capillary density, neovascularization, and decreased myocardial fibrosis together with the reestablishment of myocardial structural and ultrastructural patterns.\nUndercarboxylated osteocalcin may have a promising effect in improving microvascular insufficiency and myocardial dysfunction in DCM.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics", "date": "2019-09-20", "authors": ["Nermeen BSadek", "Sarah MGamal", "Basma EAboulhoda", "Laila ARashed", "Heba MShawky", "Maha MGamal El-Din"], "doi": "10.1177/1074248419876632"}

The commensal rodents Mus musculus and Rattus rattus are reservoirs of this parasite, which invades cardiac fibers and develops parasite nests causing various lesions. Histopathological studies in naturally infected rodents are scarce. Objective: To describe the types and frequencies of microscopic lesions in cardiac tissue of M. musculus and R. rattus infected with T. cruzi captured in M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9xico. Materials and methods: The rodents were captured in suburban environments of M\u00e9rida. Cardiac tissue was extracted and processed by the paraffin inclusion technique and hematoxylin and eosin stained. The observation was made with a conventional microscope and all the lesions, as well as their degree, were identified. Results: Eight tissue samples of M. musculus and seven of R. rattus were studied. Parasite nests were found in 7/15, specifically 3/8 in M. musculus and 4/7 in R. rattus. The inflammatory infiltrate was the most frequent lesion. Other lesions were: Degeneration of cardiac fibers (8/15), congestion of blood vessels (6/15), and necrosis (5/15). Discussion: The lesions we observed have been described in experimental animal models and in humans with American trypanosomiasis. The inflammatory infiltrate has been identified as the most significant lesion in humans and reservoirs in the chronic stage of the disease.

We have successfully created multiple cell sheet-based tissues for therapies of a vast variety of diseases, in particular, myocardial diseases. On the other side, the discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) enables stable production of defined tissue-specific cell types and thus makes it possible to regenerate tissues or even organs for clinical application and in vitro drug screening/disease modeling. Recently, we have combined cell sheet technology and hiPSC-derived cardiac cells for fabrication of functional human cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Spatiotemporal delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor to directly and simultaneously attenuate cardiac fibrosis and promote cardiac tissue vascularization following myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Following myocardial infarction (MI), the destruction of vasculature in the infarcted heart muscle and progression of cardiac fibrosis lead to cardiac function deterioration. Vascularization of the damaged tissue and prevention of cardiac fibrosis represent promising strategies to improve cardiac function. Herein we have developed a bFGF release system with suitable release kinetics to simultaneously achieve the two goals. The release system was based on an injectable, thermosensitive, and fast gelation hydrogel and bFGF. The hydrogel had gelation time <7\u202fs. It can quickly solidify upon injection into tissue so as to increase drug retention in the tissue. Hydrogel complex modulus can be tuned by hydrogel solution concentration. The complex modulus of 176.6\u202fPa and lower allowed cardiac fibroblast to maintain its phenotype. Bioactive bFGF was able to gradually release from the hydrogel for 4\u202fweeks. The released bFGF promoted cardiac fibroblast survival under ischemic conditions mimicking those of the infarcted hearts. It also attenuated cardiac fibroblasts from differentiating into myofibroblasts in the presence of TGF\u03b2 when tested in 3D collagen model mimicking the scenario when the bFGF release system was injected into hearts. Furthermore, the released bFGF stimulated human umbilical endothelial cells to form endothelial lumen. After 4\u202fweeks of implantation into infarcted hearts, the bFGF release system significantly increased blood vessel density, decreased myofibroblast density and collagen content, augmented cardiac cell survival/proliferation, and reduced macrophage density. In addition, the bFGF release system significantly increased cardiac function. These results demonstrate that delivery of bFGF with appropriate release kinetics alone may represent an efficient approach to control cardiac remodeling after MI.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2019-09-16", "authors": ["ZhaoboFan", "ZhaobinXu", "HongNiu", "YangSui", "HaichangLi", "JianjieMa", "JianjunGuan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.09.005"}

{"title": "Intrinsic Adaptation of SHR Right Atrium Reduces Heart Rate.", "abstract": "Hypertension represents an autonomic dysfunction, characterized by increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic cardiovascular tone leading to resting tachycardia. Therefore, studies assessing hypertension-associated changes in isolated cardiac tissues were conducted under electric field stimulation to stimulate the neurons. Herein, we characterize the influence of the autonomic neurotransmitter on the baseline atrial chronotropism of unpaced isolated right atria of normotensive Wistar rats (NWR) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Our results revealed a resting bradycardia in tissues from SHR in comparison to NWR. The release of autonomic neurotransmitters, acetylcholine or norepinephrine, still occurs in the electrically unstimulated right atrium, after excision of the sympathetic nerve, which could explain differences in basal heart rate between NWR and SHR. Nicotine and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine reduced the chronotropism of right atria from either NWR or SHR. Conversely, the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine did not affect the basal chronotropism of tissues from both strains. Furthermore, tyramine increased the chronotropism of NWR and SHR atria indicating availability of the neuronal stocks of noradrenaline. Although the monoamine uptake inhibitor cocaine increased right atrium chronotropism in both strains, the basal heart rate was not affected by the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. In summary, after acute section of the sympathetic nerve, autonomic neurotransmitters are still released either in resting conditions or upon pharmacological stimulation of right atria from both strains. Nevertheless, autonomic neurotransmission does not affect resting chronotropism, nor is the responsible for reduced basal heart rate of the isolated right atrium of hypertensive rats.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology", "date": "2019-09-14", "authors": ["Juliano Quintella DantasRodrigues", "HenriqueCamara", "Edilson Dantasda Silva Junior", "Rosely OliveiraGodinho", "AronJurkiewicz"], "doi": "10.1097/FJC.0000000000000746"}

{"title": "Mechanical loading of isolated cardiac muscle with a real-time computed Windkessel model of the vasculature impedance.", "abstract": "To date, the mechanical loads imposed on isolated cardiac muscle tissue in vitro have been oversimplified. Researchers typically applied loads that are time-invariant, resulting in either isometric and auxotonic contractions, or flat-topped (isotonic shortening) work-loops. These contraction types do not fully capture the dynamic response of contracting tissues adapting to a variable load, such as is experienced by ventricular tissue in vivo. In this study, we have successfully developed a loading system that presents a model-based, time-varying, continuously updated, load to cardiac tissue preparations. We combined a Windkessel model of vascular fluid impedance together with Laplace's Law and encoded it in a real-time hardware-based force-length control system. Experiments were carried out on isolated rat left ventricular trabeculae; we directly compare the work-loops arising from this protocol with those of a typical simplified isotonic shortening work-loop system. We found that, under body conditions, cardiac trabeculae achieved greater mechanical work output against our new loading system, than with the simplified isotonic work-loop protocol. We further tested whether loading the tissue with a mechanical impedance defined by \"diseased\" Windkessel model parameters had an effect on the performance of healthy trabeculae. We found that trabecula shortening decreased when applying the set of Windkessel parameters describing the hypertensive condition, and increased in the hypotensive state.

Afterward, the hearts in all groups were subjected to 20-minute global ischemia and 30-minute reperfusion. Parameters of heart function were registered, including maximum and minimum rate of pressure development, systolic and diastolic left ventricular pressure, heart rate and coronary flow.

Its pathogenesis in broilers is poorly understood, and little is known about the proteome of the heart tissue of SDS broilers. A quantitative proteomic approach using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling of peptides was used to characterize the protein expression profiles in the left ventricle of SDS broilers. These proteins were further analyzed by bioinformatics, and two proteins were validated by western blot analysis. We identified 186 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), of which 72 were upregulated, and 114 were downregulated in the SDS group.

Infection with one of the four serotypes provides lifelong homotypic immunity. However, immunity against the heterologous serotypes is transient. As a consequence, secondary infection may lead to severer manifestations due to cross-reactivity of antibodies and T-cells. Over 500,000 people are hospitalized every year and around 2,5 million, living in endemic areas, are at risk of infection. Given the background, the development of vaccines and anti-DENV drugs is of the utmost importance, as is the characterization of an animal model for testing them. The purpose of this study was to investigate ultrastructural alterations caused by DENV secondary infection in BALB/c mice heart. To achieve our goal, six BALB/c mice were infected with DENV-1 and, 4 months later, reinfected with DENV-2. Uninfected mice were used as negative controls. Heart samples were collected and processed for ultrastructural and histopathological analysis. Our results showed edema, endothelium activation characterized by the presence of transport vesicles, free platelets in interstitium, mitochondria presenting rarefied matrix and degenerated cristae, and disorganization of muscle fibers. These results point not only to BALB/c mice susceptibility to DENV infection, but also to the fact that, although it is not an often reported occurrence, dengue can lead to heart damage.

We investigated the possible protective effect of infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitor on DOX-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of DOX (17.5\u00a0mg/kg) in the absence or presence of infliximab (5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Plasma and urinary markers of kidney function, oxidative stress, and inflammation were measured. Kidney and heart tissue was evaluated histopathologically. DOX-induced nephrotoxicity was confirmed by increased plasma urea, creatinine, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and clusterin concentrations. In addition, DOX increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity, kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) concentrations, and reduced creatinine clearance. DOX significantly reduced renal antioxidants and increased plasma inflammatory markers and adiponectin concentrations. Concomitant treatment with infliximab did not significantly affect DOX-induced changes in plasma creatinine, cystatin C, or creatinine clearance. However, infliximab significantly reduced DOX-induced action on plasma urea, NGAL, clusterin, and adiponectin. Infliximab also significantly reduced urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, NAG activity, and KIM-1 concentrations, as well as the occurrence of fibrotic lesions in kidney tissue.

MicroRNAs have recently emerged as a crucial part of signalling cascade in both development and diseases. We aimed to identify, validate, and perform functional annotation of putative novel miRNAs using chicken as a cardiac development model system. Novel miRNAs were obtained through deep sequencing of small RNAs extracted from chicken embryonic cardiac tissue of different developmental stages. After filtering out real pre-miRNAs, their expression analysis, potential target gene's prediction and functional annotations were performed. Expression analysis revealed that miRNAs were differentially expressed during different developmental stages of chicken heart.

Mitochondrion-targeted antioxidant peptide SS31 has been revealed to be responsible for certain cardiovascular disease by ameliorating oxidative stress injury. But whether it protects a septic heart remains little known. This study sought to prove that SS31 was capable of improving sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction dramatically. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), exposed to systemic inflammation. Thirty-five C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham group, LPS group (5\u00a0mg/kg), SS31 group (5\u00a0mg/kg), and SS31 + LPS group (treatment group). Heart tissues were harvested for pathological examination at the indicated time points. H9C2 cell were treated with LPS with or without the presence of SS31 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C to assess the effect on cardiomyocytes at the indicated time points. SS31 restored myocardial morphological damage and suppressed inflammatory response as evidenced by significantly decreasing the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, myocardial energy deficiency secondary to sepsis was remarkedly ameliorated by SS31. Furthermore, we found that SS-31 normalized the activity of malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in vitro and in vivo, and maintained mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as well. And western blot was applied to measure the expressions of p-p38MAPK, p-JNK1/2, p-ERK, p62, and NF-\u03baB p65; the results illuminated that the cardioprotective effect of SS31 was partly linked to NF-\u03baB.

A thermocouple was used to measure the interstitial tissue temperature during the laser ablation process. Tissue-strain-based ultrasound thermal imaging was conducted to monitor the spatial distribution of the temperature in the cardiac tissue. The tissue temperature was estimated from the time shifts of ultrasound signals owing to the changes in the speed of sound and was compared with the measured temperature. The temperature estimation coefficient k of porcine cardiac tissue was calculated from the estimated thermal strain and the measured temperature. The degree of tissue coagulation (temperatures\u2009>\u200950\u00b0C) was derived from the estimated temperature and was compared with that of the tested cardiac tissue.\nThe estimated tissue temperature using strain-based ultrasound thermal imaging at a depth of 1\u2009mm agreed with thermocouple measurements. During the 30-second period of the laser ablation process, the estimated tissue temperature increased from 25 to 70\u00b0C at a depth of 0.1\u2009mm, while the estimated temperature at a depth of 1\u2009mm increased up to 46\u00b0C. Owing to the uncertainty of the coefficient k, the k value of the porcine cardiac tissue varied from 160 to 220\u00b0C with temperature changes of up to 20\u00b0C.

However, the immature phenotype of hiPS-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) limits their utility. We have developed a protocol to generate engineered cardiac tissues from hiPS cells and electromechanically mature them toward an adult-like phenotype. This protocol also provides optimized methods for analyzing these tissues' functionality, ultrastructure, and cellular properties. The approach relies on biological adaptation of cultured tissues subjected to biomimetic cues, applied at an increasing intensity, to drive accelerated maturation. hiPS cells are differentiated into cardiomyocytes and used immediately after the first contractions are observed, when they still have developmental plasticity. This starting cell population is combined with human dermal fibroblasts, encapsulated in a fibrin hydrogel and allowed to compact under passive tension in a custom-designed bioreactor. After 7 d of tissue formation, the engineered tissues are matured for an additional 21 d by increasingly intense electromechanical stimulation. Tissue properties can be evaluated by measuring contractile function, responsiveness to electrical stimuli, ultrastructure properties (sarcomere length, mitochondrial density, networks of transverse tubules), force-frequency and force-length relationships, calcium handling, and responses to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists. Cell properties can be evaluated by monitoring gene/protein expression, oxidative metabolism, and electrophysiology.

In this study, we investigate the efficacies of PAI-1 inhibitors in both in vitro and in vivo models of homocysteine (Hcy)-induced cardiovascular aging. Elevated Hcy, a known risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, induces endothelial senescence as evidenced by increased senescence-associated \u03b2-Gal positivity (SA-\u03b2-Gal), flattened cellular morphology, and cylindrical appearance of cellular nuclei. Importantly, inhibition of PAI-1 by small molecule inhibitors reduces the number of SA-\u03b2-Gal positive cells, normalizes cellular morphology and nuclear shape. Furthermore, while Hcy induces the levels of senescence regulators PAI-1, p16, p53 and integrin \u03b23, and suppresses catalase expression, treatment with PAI-1 inhibitors blocks the Hcy-induced stimulation of senescence cadres, and reverses the Hcy-induced suppression of catalase, indicating that PAI-1 specific small molecule inhibitors are efficient to prevent Hcy-induced cellular senescence. Our in vivo study shows that the levels of integrin \u03b23, a recently identified potential regulator of cellular senescence, and its interaction with PAI-1 are significantly elevated in Hcy-treated heart tissues. In contrast, Hcy suppresses antioxidant gene regulator Nrf2 expression in hearts. However, co-treatment with PAI-1 inhibitor completely blocks the stimulation of Hcy-induced induction of integrin \u03b23 and reverses Nrf2 expression. Collectively these in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 improves endothelial and cardiac health by suppressing the pro-senescence effects of hyperhomocysteinemia through suppression of Hcy-induced master regulators of cellular senescence PAI-1 and integrin \u03b23. Therefore, PAI-1 inhibitors are promising drugs for amelioration of hyperhomocysteinemia-induced vascular aging and aging-related disease.", "journal": "Cellular signalling", "date": "2019-09-01", "authors": ["TianjiaoSun", "Asish KGhosh", "MesutEren", "ToshioMiyata", "Douglas EVaughan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cellsig.2019.109394"}

Sixty Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomized into five groups (N = 12): control, diabetic, diabetic treated with calcitriol and/or pomegranate peel extract (PPE), and mated with non-diabetic healthy males. After confirmation of pregnancy, treatments were kept until gestational day (E-18). Serum and cardiac tissues of mothers and foetuses were collected and processed for biochemical, histopathological, and molecular assessments. We observed that, compared to the control, diabetic mothers showed dramatically increased hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia associated with decreased myocardial functions and disrupted maternal performance. Also, diabetic mothers and their neonates exhibited elevated levels of myocardial injury (troponin I, endothelin 1, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase), with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1, interleukin 1\u03b2, transforming growth factor \u03b2) and oxidative redox.

{"title": "Electrospun Conducting and Biocompatible Uniaxial and Core-Shell Fibers Having Poly(lactic acid), Poly(ethylene glycol), and Polyaniline for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.", "abstract": "Electroactive and biocompatible fibrous scaffolds have been prepared and characterized using polyaniline (PAni) doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) combined with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PLA/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) mixtures. The composition of simple and core-shell fibers, which have been obtained by both uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning, respectively, has been corroborated by Fourier-transform infrared and micro-Raman spectroscopies. Morphological studies suggest that the incorporation of PEG enhances the packing of PLA and PAni chains, allowing the regulation of the thickness of the fibers. PAni and PEG affect the thermal and electrical properties of the fibers, both decreasing the glass transition temperature and increasing the electrical conductivity. Interestingly, the incorporation of PEG improves the PAni-containing paths associated with the conduction properties. Although dose response curves evidence the high cytotoxicity of PAni/DBSA, cell adhesion and cell proliferation studies on PLA/PAni fibers show a reduction of such harmful effects as the conducting polymer is mainly retained inside the fibers through favorable PAni\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7PLA interactions. The incorporation of PEG into uniaxial fibers resulted in an increment of the cell mortality, which has been attributed to its rapid dissolution into the culture medium and the consequent enhancement of PAni release. In opposition, the delivery of PAni decreases and, therefore, the biocompatibility of the fibers increases when a shell coating the PAni-containing system is incorporated through coaxial electrospinning.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the cellular fate of cardiomyocytes in a 3D scaffold microenvironment, as well as their role in generating the cellular diversity of ECTs by single-cell sequencing analysis. Consistent with the observed plasticity of cardiomyocytes during cardiac regeneration, cardiomyocytes in 3D scaffolds appeared to dedifferentiate, showing an initial loss of normal cytoskeleton organization in the adaptive response to the new scaffold microenvironment. Cardiomyocytes undergoing this process regained their proliferation potential and gradually developed into myocardial cells at different developmental stages, generating heterogeneous regenerative ECTs. To better characterize the remodeled ECTs, high-throughput single-cell sequencing was performed. The ECTs contained a wide diversity of cells related to endogenous classes in the heart, including myocardial cells at different developmental stages and different kinds of interstitial cells.

Among the various isoforms of apelin, an increase in the apelin-36 plasma level has been associated with oxidative stress, and this isoform has various biological effects, such as positive inotropic, vasodilatory, and antiatherosclerotic effects. Therefore, apelin-36 may be used as a biomarker of heart failure (HF). Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF cannot be achieved without the use of animal models. However, it is unclear whether chronic systemic hypoxia can cause HF in rats. The present study aimed to determine whether chronic systemic hypoxia can cause HF in rats and whether apelin-36 can be used as a biomarker of HF. The study included Sprague-Dawley rats.

{"title": "IFITM3 protects the heart during influenza virus infection.", "abstract": "Influenza virus can disseminate from the lungs to the heart in severe infections and can induce cardiac pathology, but this has been difficult to study due to a lack of small animal models. In humans, polymorphisms in the gene encoding the antiviral restriction factor IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) are associated with susceptibility to severe influenza, but whether IFITM3 deficiencies contribute to cardiac dysfunction during infection is unclear. We show that IFITM3 deficiency in a new knockout (KO) mouse model increases weight loss and mortality following influenza virus infections. We investigated this enhanced pathogenesis with the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) influenza virus strain, which is lethal in KO mice even at low doses, and observed increased replication of virus in the lungs, spleens, and hearts of KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Infected IFITM3 KO mice developed aberrant cardiac electrical activity, including decreased heart rate and irregular, arrhythmic RR (interbeat) intervals, whereas WT mice exhibited a mild decrease in heart rate without irregular RR intervals. Cardiac electrical dysfunction in PR8-infected KO mice was accompanied by increased activation of fibrotic pathways and fibrotic lesions in the heart. Infection with a sublethal dose of a less virulent influenza virus strain (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]) resulted in a milder cardiac electrical dysfunction in KO mice that subsided as the mice recovered. Our findings reveal an essential role for IFITM3 in limiting influenza virus replication and pathogenesis in heart tissue and establish IFITM3 KO mice as a powerful model for studying mild and severe influenza virus-induced cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2019-08-28", "authors": ["Adam DKenney", "Temet MMcMichael", "AlexanderImas", "Nicholas MChesarino", "LizhiZhang", "Lisa EDorn", "QianWu", "OmarAlfaour", "FouedAmari", "MinChen", "AshleyZani", "MaheshChemudupati", "FedericaAccornero", "VincenzoCoppola", "Murugesan V SRajaram", "Jacob SYount"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1900784116"}

Historically, respiratory failure has been the leading cause of mortality in DMD, but recent improvements in symptomatic respiratory management have extended the life expectancy of DMD patients. With increased longevity, the clinical relevance of heart disease in DMD is growing, as virtually all DMD patients over 18 year of age display signs of cardiomyopathy. This review will focus on the pathophysiological basis of DMD in the heart and discuss the therapeutic approaches currently in use and those in development to treat dystrophic cardiomyopathy. The first section will describe the aspects of the DMD that result in the loss of cardiac tissue and accumulation of fibrosis. The second section will discuss cardiac small molecule therapies currently used to treat heart disease in DMD, with a focus on the evidence supporting the use of each drug in dystrophic patients. The final section will outline the strengths and limitations of approaches directed at correcting the genetic defect through dystrophin gene replacement, modification, or repair. There are several new and promising therapeutic approaches that may protect the dystrophic heart, but their limitations suggest that future management of dystrophic cardiomyopathy may benefit from combining gene-targeted therapies with small molecule therapies.

{"title": "Hawthorn revisited: time- and dose-dependent cardioprotective action of WS-1442 special extract in the reperfusion-induced arrhythmia model in rats in vivo.", "abstract": "Standardized WS-1442 extract from Crataegus oxycantha (hawthorn) leaves and berries is one of the most widely studied preparations received from hawthorn. This popular substance is known from its positive influence on the cardiovascular system. The current research aimed to evaluate the optimal dose of standardized WS-1442 extract and the most beneficial period for its use. The study analysis was based on experiments previously conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 152). The animals were divided into subgroups to examine the relationship between the dose-dependent (n = 96) and time-dependent (n = 56) effects of the mentioned extract. The research was performed based on the modified early reperfusion-induced arrhythmias model in vivo. The following parameters were assessed during the study: efficiency of mortality index reduction, reduction of ventricular arrhythmias incidences as well as the influence of standardized WS-1442 extract on hemodynamic parameters and amount of biochemical marker of cardiac tissue damage (creatine kinase). The current study revealed the dose- and time-dependent cardioprotective effect of standardized WS-1442 extract. It was expressed by mortality index reduction, decrease in the incidence and duration of severe ventricular arrhythmias and decline in the total amount of creatine kinase. Analyzed data coming from a model of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in rats suggests that standardized WS-1442 extract is a potent cardioprotective agent whose action depends on both dose and intake time.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2019-08-24", "authors": ["MZorniak", "M PPorc", "T FKrzeminski"], "doi": "10.26402/jpp.2019.2.14"}
{"title": "Immunometabolic cross-talk in the inflamed heart.", "abstract": "Inflammatory processes underlie many diseases associated with injury of the heart muscle, including conditions without an obvious inflammatory pathogenic component such as hypertensive and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Persistence of cardiac inflammation can cause irreversible structural and functional deficits. Some are induced by direct damage of the heart muscle by cellular and soluble mediators but also by metabolic adaptations sustained by the inflammatory microenvironment. It is well established that both cardiomyocytes and immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming in the site of inflammation, which allow them to deal with decreased availability of nutrients and oxygen. However, like in cancer, competition for nutrients and increased production of signalling metabolites such as lactate initiate a metabolic cross-talk between immune cells and cardiomyocytes which, we propose, might tip the balance between resolution of the inflammation versus adverse cardiac remodeling. Here we review our current understanding of the metabolic reprogramming of both heart tissue and immune cells during inflammation, and we discuss potential key mechanisms by which these metabolic

{"title": "Administration of losartan preserves cardiomyocyte size and prevents myocardial dysfunction in tail-suspended mice by inhibiting p47", "abstract": "Spaceflight or microgravity conditions cause myocardial atrophy and dysfunction, contributing to post-flight orthostatic intolerance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood and preventive approaches are limited. This study investigated whether and how losartan, a blocker of angiotensin-II receptor, preserved cardiomyocyte size and prevented myocardial dysfunction during microgravity.\nAdult male mice were suspended with their tails to simulate microgravity. Echocardiography was performed to assess myocardial function. Heart weight and cardiomyocyte size were measured.

Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) is an endogenous heptapeptide from the renin-angiotensin system with a cardioprotective role due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities in cardiac cells. Although the beneficial aspects of Ang-(1-7) in animal models of cardiac ischemia have been reported, the molecular events underlying Ang-(1-7) cardioprotective effect remains elusive. This study investigated the impact of oral treatment with Ang-(1-7) included in hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD/Ang-(1-7)) on the cardiac proteome dysregulation due to experimental myocardial infarction. Wistar male rats were submitted to experimental myocardial infarction and treated daily with HP\u03b2CD/Ang-(1-7) during 7\u202fdays or 60\u202fdays by gavage. Our results showed that HP\u03b2CD/Ang-(1-7) treatment ameliorates the post-infarction condition due to the modulation of proteins that initially favor the resolution of inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, this study reported for the first time that Ang-(1-7) treatment after experimental myocardial infarction leads to the downregulation of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). SIGNIFICANCE: Myocardial infarction triggers a sequence of cellular and molecular events that starts with an intense inflammatory response that is resolved in the proliferative phase. Prolonged inflammatory phase can lead to adverse cardiac repair and heart failure. In this context, we proposed a post-MI treatment using Ang-(1-7) included in HP\u03b2CD and administrated orally. We observed that HP\u03b2CD/Ang-(1-7) treatment led to CXCR4 downregulation, highlighting this C-X-C chemokine receptor as a potential therapeutic target for ischemic heart diseases.", "journal": "Journal of proteomics", "date": "2019-08-23", "authors": ["Diana PaolaG\u00f3mez-Mendoza", "F\u00falvia DiasMarques", "Marcella NunesMelo-Braga", "Richard RSprenger", "Rub\u00e9n DarioSinisterra", "FrankKjeldsen", "Robson AugustoSantos", "ThiagoVerano-Braga"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jprot.2019.103486"}

{"title": "Halofuginone protects against advanced glycation end products\u2011induced injury of H9C2 cells via alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress\u2011associated apoptosis and inducing autophagy.", "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been reported to serve an important role in the stiffening of cardiac tissues and myocardial cell injury. Serious myocardial cell injury can result in various heart diseases with high mortality. Halofuginone (HF), which possesses marked anti\u2011inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, has recently been applied to inhibit the effects of cardiac stress. The present study aimed to investigate the potential effects of HF and its underlying mechanism in the treatment of AGEs\u2011induced H9C2 cardiomyocyte damage. The western blot results of the present study demonstrated that HF may reduce the expression levels of myocardial injury markers, including myoglobin, creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin I. In addition, flow cytometric analysis indicated that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly decreased by HF. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was suppressed in response to treatment with HF, as observed by low expression levels of ER stress\u2011associated proapoptotic proteins (CCAAT/enhancer\u2011binding protein homologous protein and cleaved caspase\u201112); overexpression of prosurvival proteins (growth arrest and DNA damage\u2011inducible protein GADD34 and binding immunoglobulin protein) was also reported. Furthermore, the expression levels of microtubule\u2011associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3)II/LC3I and Beclin 1 were elevated, whereas P62 expression levels were reduced following treatment with HF. These findings, together with immunofluorescence staining of LC3, indicated that HF may induce autophagy. Finally, the protective effects of HF on AGEs\u2011treated H9C2 cells were reversed following treatment with the inhibitor 3\u2011methyladenine, as indicated by inhibition of autophagy, and increases in apoptosis, ROS production and the ER stress response. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that the protective effects of HF against AGEs\u2011induced myocardial cell injury may be associated with the induction of autophagy and amelioration of ROS\u2011mediated ER stress and apoptosis. These findings may contribute to the development of a novel therapeutic method to inhibit the progression of myocardial cell injury.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2019-08-23", "authors": ["Yu-HuiLi", "Wei-LiZhang", "Hao-YingZhou", "Da-WeiYu", "Xiao-NingSun", "QinHu"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2019.10554\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.05.001\n10.1073/pnas.95.3.1301\n10.1016/j.cbi.2016.03.015\n10.1126/science.1230719\n10.1016/j.intimp.2016.12.016\n10.1177/0960327116660753\n10.1097/BCR.0000000000000400\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.029\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318256ce10\n10.1002/stem.2015\n10.1038/nrd2755\n10.1038/s41467-017-00171-w\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.10.015\n10.1038/cddis.2017.203\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000181744.58265.63\n10.1002/jcb.23212\n10.1136/bmj.i3477\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60107-0\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.09.003\n10.1002/ptr.2575\n10.1124/jpet.107.133918\n10.1016/j.mehy.2013.01.001\n10.1186/1475-2840-12-158\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.05.023\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.224519\n10.1016/j.jpurol.2012.01.015\n10.3109/00207454.2012.746974\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.03.025\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175448\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.237339\n10.1001/jama.2009.371\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135757"}

In addition, the different oriented layers of the left ventricle lead to a dynamic biaxial stretching on cardiomyocytes, which makes the mechanical microenvironment in the myocardium much more complex. Thus, it is important to investigate the effect of dynamic mechanical stimulation along different directions to preoriented cardiomyocytes on the functionalities of engineered cardiac tissues. In this study, we regenerate oriented cardiac tissues using electrospun silk fibroin scaffolds, followed by applying the dynamic mechanical stimulation parallel or perpendicular to the cell orientation. The design and utilization of nanofibrous scaffolds combining the aligned topography and random substrate ensure the realization of dynamic mechanical stimulation with a homogeneous strain along both directions. The results reveal that the parallel mechanical stretching promotes the alignment of cardiomyocytes and the formation of sarcomeres and gap junctions, while the perpendicular stimulation interferes with the cell alignment and gap junction formation.

{"title": "The Role of Macrophages in the Infarcted Myocardium: Orchestrators of ECM Remodeling.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is the most common form of acute cardiac injury attributing to heart failure. While there have been significant advances in current therapies, mortality and morbidity remain high. Emphasis on inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling as key pathological factors has brought to light new potential therapeutic targets including macrophages which are central players in the inflammatory response following myocardial infarction. Blood derived and tissue resident macrophages exhibit both a pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotype, essential for removing injured tissue and facilitating repair, respectively. Sustained activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages evokes extensive remodeling of cardiac tissue through secretion of matrix proteases and activation of myofibroblasts. As the heart continues to employ methods of remodeling and repair, a destructive cycle prevails ultimately leading to deterioration of cardiac function and heart failure. This review summarizes not only the traditionally accepted role of macrophages in the heart but also recent advances that have deepened our understanding and appreciation of this dynamic cell. We discuss the role of macrophages in normal and maladaptive matrix remodeling, as well as studies to date which have aimed to target the inflammatory response in combatting excessive matrix deposition and subsequent heart failure.", "journal": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine", "date": "2019-08-17", "authors": ["Sinead AO'Rourke", "AislingDunne", "Michael GMonaghan"], "doi": "10.3389/fcvm.2019.00101\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000491\n10.15420/cfr.2016:25:2\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00143\n10.3390/ijms19113361\n10.15420/cfr.2015.1.2.64\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.006\n10.1038/nrm1911\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.14.1375\n10.1253/circj.CJ-16-1003\n10.1016/S1054-8807(97)00119-1\n10.2174/13816128113199990452\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1038/nri3073\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.008\n10.2741/2692\n10.1186/2050-7771-2-1\n10.1189/jlb.0104014\n10.1007/s10753-013-9621-3\n10.1172/JCI1112\n10.1016/j.mib.2013.10.007\n10.1038/ni.2705\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314357\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311071\n10.1038/s41591-018-0059-x\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.308270\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314028\n10.1038/s41590-018-0272-2\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.1038/cmi.2014.116\n10.1016/j.matbio.2017.12.001\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1152/ajpheart.00862.2004\n10.1002/bdra.20810\n10.1073/pnas.1424236112\n10.1096/fasebj.5.11.1868978\n10.1038/s41569-018-0064-2\n10.1155/2017/7396462\n10.1038/s41598-017-16201-y\n10.1016/0033-0620(90)90039-5\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2018.10.002\n10.1097/HCO.0000000000000158\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00630-0\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303567\n10.1016/j.trsl.2017.10.001\n10.1084/jem.20070885\n10.1007/s00395-018-0686-x\n10.3389/fimmu.2014.00420\n10.1038/nri3607\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.12.004\n10.3389/fcvm.2017.00086\n10.1186/s12872-017-0473-x\n10.2119/2007-00119.Tilg\n10.1101/cshperspect.a005058\n10.1074/jbc.270.11.5872\n10.1016/j.matbio.2017.04.003\n10.1172/JCI20741\n10.1073/pnas.1221602110\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65060-2\n10.1182/blood-2015-05-644260\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.09.024\n10.1016/0304-4165(92)90095-C\n10.1093/cvr/cvv214\n10.1007/s00395-017-0646-x\n10.1002/cphy.c140067\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63309-3\n10.1002/eji.1830200404\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.03.009\n10.1152/ajpheart.00141.2011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.217737\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.216101\n10.4049/jimmunol.1300725\n10.1016/j.matbio.2013.03.008\n10.1161/01.RES.0000136520.07995.aa\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.11.004\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1000023\n10.1016/j.cyto.2014.12.024\n10.7150/thno.19435\n10.1007/s00395-014-0440-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.112185\n10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00148-6\n10.1016/j.ahj.2005.02.040\n10.1177/1074248417699884\n10.1016/j.cardfail.2009.06.439\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01700.x\n10.1186/s40064-016-2751-y\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016160\n10.1113/expphysiol.2012.069831\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.12.059\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehu272\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.01.287\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32814-3\n10.1136/heartjnl-2013-303648\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000124490.27666.B2\n10.2174/156802610791561255\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf1435\n10.1038/nbt.1989\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000116\n10.1038/mt.2013.288\n10.1089/ten.tea.2016.0527\n10.1093/cvr/cvy145\n10.1038/nri1418\n10.1016/j.biochi.2004.10.006\n10.1016/j.biocel.2007.12.005\n10.1038/srep43057\n10.1038/nm1361\n10.1093/hmg/dds439\n10.1007/s10930-012-9415-8\n10.1016/j.biocel.2008.05.025\n10.1016/j.peptides.2012.08.014\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199712)173:3<327::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-P\n10.1023/A:1006550503612\n10.1042/bj2700459"}
{"title": "DNA methylation microarray uncovers a permissive methylome for cardiomyocyte differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Differentiation of Wharton's Jelly-Mesenchymal Stem cells (WJ-MSCs) into cardiomyocytes (CMs) in vitro has been reported widely although contradictions remain regarding the maturation of differentiated MSCs into fully functioning CMs. Studies suggest that use of epigenetic modifiers like 5'Azacytidine (5-AC) in MSCs de-methylates DNA and results in expression of cardiac-specific genes (CSGs). However, only partial expression of the CSG set leads to incomplete differentiation of WJ-MSCs to CMs. We used the Agilent 180\u202fK human DNA methylation microarray on WJ-MSCs, 5-AC treated WJ-MSCs and human cardiac tissue (hCT) to analyze differential DNA methylation profiles which were then validated by bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). BSP confirmed that only a limited number of CSGs were de-methylated by 5-AC in WJ-MSCs. It also revealed that hCT displays a methylation profile similar to promoter regions of CSG in untreated WJ-MSCs. Thus, the presence of hypo-methylated CSGs indicates that WJ-MSCs are ideal cell types for cardiomyogenic differentiation.", "journal": "Genomics", "date": "2019-08-16", "authors": ["KavithaGovarthanan", "Piyush KumarGupta", "DeepaRamasamy", "PavitraKumar", "ShobanaMahadevan", "Rama ShankerVerma"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ygeno.2019.08.007"}
{"title": "[First Isolation of Coxiella burnetii in Turkey from a Patient with Endocarditis; Antigen Production and Phase Change Study].", "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever, a zoonotic infection. The bacteria is a gram-negative, pleomorphic, coccobacilli and capable to survive and proliferate within the host cell's phagolysosome. There are two morphological cell types of C.burnetii including small and large cell variants. C.burnetii is divided into phase I and phase II serologically variants according to LPS structure in the cell wall. Phase I is the natural phase found in infected animals or humans and is highly infectious. Phase II is not very infectious and could be obtained only in laboratories after serial passages in cell cultures or embryonated egg cultures. Q fever can be asymptomatic (in 50% of the cases), acute or chronic. Major presentations of acute Q fever are flu-like illness, pneumonia, and hepatitis, whereas the chronic form presents mainly as infective endocarditis. The aim of this study was to obtain C.burnetii phase II variant from C.burnetii phase I variant by a phase change study. In this study, C.burnetii was isolated by cell culture method from the heart valve tissue of a Q fever endocarditis case. C.burnetii phase I antigen for the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was prepared from the isolated strain. For the isolation and identification of C.burnetii, heart valve tissue of the patient was homogenized and DNA was extracted by tissue extraction kit. C.burnetii DNA in the valve tissue was determined by real-time PCR (Rt-PCR). This C.burnetii DNA positive specimen was inoculated into Vero cells by shell vial centrifugation method. The scraped Vero cells were fixed on the slides after one week of incubation and IFAT was performed using C.burnetii phase I IgG positive sera, bacteria that were grown in and surrounding the Vero cells stained apple green were determined microscopically. Infected cells were disrupted by freeze and thaw method to obtain bacterial suspension. The DNA obtained from the bacterial suspension was again found to be positive for C.burnetii by Rt-PCR. Isolation sample was found to be positive in PCR at an earlier cycle compared to heart tissue sample, thus the bacterial growth was also confirmed with PCR. 16S ribosomal RNA gene of our isolate was amplified by PCR using 27F and 1492 primers and then sequenced. The DNA sequences were compared with reference DNA sequences of GeneBank; and the nucleotide sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of our isolate was found to be 99% similar to C.burnetii strain ATCC VR-615 an accession number NR104916. Serial cell culture passages of the isolated strain were performed to obtain C.burnetii phase II variant from C.burnetii phase I variant. After each passage, presence of phase change was investigated by IFAT using C.burnetii phase I and phase II IgG positive sera. At the end of 17 cell culture passages, phase change could not be observed. C.burnetii phase I IFAT antigen was prepared from the obtained bacterial suspension. In this study, we presented the isolation and identification of C.burnetii by cell culture, molecular and serological methods from the heart valve of a patient with endocarditis for the first time in our country.", "journal": "Mikrobiyoloji bulteni", "date": "2019-08-16", "authors": ["Bekir\u00c7elebi", "B\u00fclentBa\u015f", "ElifAg\u00fclo\u011flu Bali", "Serap\u015eim\u015fek Yavuz"], "doi": "10.5578/mb.68336"}

The cardiac patches were generated using 3D-bioprinting technology in conjunction with cellular spheroids created from a coculture of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Once printed and cultured, the cardiac patches were implanted into a rat myocardial infarction model (n = 6). A control group (n = 6) without the implantation of cardiac tissue patches was used for comparison. The potential for regeneration was measured 4 weeks after the surgery with histology and echocardiography. 4 weeks after surgery, the survival rates were 100% and 83% in the experimental and the control group, respectively. In the cardiac patch group, the average vessel counts within the infarcted area were higher than those within the control group. The scar area in the cardiac patch group was significantly smaller than that in the control group.

Furthermore, downregulated miR-218 and MITF aggravated the conditions than downregulation of miR-218 alone in MI rats.\nMI models were performed in rats, and then the rats were injected with miR-218 inhibitors and/or MITF overexpression plasmid to elucidate the role of miR-218 and/or MITF on the cardiac function, pathological damage, cardiac fibrosis, angiogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammatory injury of cardiac tissues in MI rats by performing a series of assays.\nCollectively, we found that the suppression of miR-218 alleviates cardiac fibrosis and cardiac function impairment, and stimulates angiogenesis in MI rats through inhibiting MITF.", "journal": "Aging", "date": "2019-08-14", "authors": ["LinfengQian", "ShaoboPan", "LipingShi", "YongyiZhou", "LaiSun", "ZhedongWan", "YufangDing", "JiaQian"], "doi": "10.18632/aging.102112\n10.1038/nature13917\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.207\n10.1007/s00395-015-0484-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0074535\n10.2147/DDDT.S104925\n10.1016/j.mvr.2010.03.014\n10.1016/j.biopha.2016.09.054\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.015\n10.1093/cvr/cvp015\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300137\n10.1371/journal.pone.0108468\n10.1038/ncomms2090\n10.4238/2015.December.9.5\n10.1093/abbs/gmt109\n10.4161/cbt.29706\n10.1016/j.msec.2016.10.052\n10.1371/journal.pone.0050536\n10.1242/dev.060046\n10.1038/nature02247\n10.1002/jcb.27721\n10.1073/pnas.0912701107\n10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.00010.x\n10.1042/BSR20170302\n10.1371/journal.pone.0073473\n10.4161/rna.28865\n10.1007/s11033-014-3351-y\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.158220\n10.1038/nature11919\n10.1038/nature07511\n10.1073/pnas.0805038105\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.255737\n10.1038/cdd.2009.109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223172\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0368\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2126\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.05.007\n10.18632/oncotarget.22239\n10.1039/c2mb25228g\n10.1016/j.domaniend.2009.10.004\n10.1371/journal.pone.0040967\n10.1074/jbc.M112.354761\n10.3892/or.2015.3861\n10.3390/ijms17060848\n10.1016/j.exer.2018.02.023\n10.1056/NEJM199101033240101"}
{"title": "Identification of human miR-1839-5p by small RNA-seq, a miRNA enriched in neoplastic tissues.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression through destabilization or translational inhibition of cytoplasmic transcripts or by transcriptional regulation through binding to genomic DNA. Although miRNAs are globally down-regulated in cancer, some are overexpressed in neoplastic tissues, playing key roles in tumorigenesis (oncomiRs), sometimes behaving as effective cancer markers.\nUsing total RNA from human uterus adenocarcinoma and non-neoplastic uterus, we conducted a small RNA-sequencing experiment followed by prediction of novel miRNAs using MirDeep* software. Synteny analysis and whole genome alignments were performed using BLAST. We also evaluated expression by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in normal tissues of the FSD2 gene, which spans the human miR-1839-5p gene in the opposite direction.\nMirDeep* analysis predicted a miRNA not previously annotated in databases, identical to and likely the orthologue of mouse miR-1839-5p. Whole-genome local alignments of this miRNA revealed a single perfect hit that is indeed syntenic to mouse miR-1839-5p. Alignments with other mammalian orthologues showed considerable conservation. We validated the prediction via a stem-loop RT-PCR assay, also employed to screen RNA samples from several additional normal and cancer tissues, showing increased expression in neoplastic tissues compared to their respective non neoplastic counterparts. Human heart tissue expresses both miR-1839-5p and FSD2.\nHuman tissues express an orthologue of mouse miR-1839-5p and, given its expression pattern, we suggest that this miRNA could be explored as a potential oncomiR or cancer marker. Also, according to the genomic organization of miR-1839-5p and FSD2, perfect complementarity exists between the two elements, making possible miRNA-directed cleavage in human cardiac tissue.", "journal": "The journal of gene medicine", "date": "2019-08-14", "authors": ["MirnaMart\u00ednez-Saucedo", "YolandaB\u00e1rcenas-G\u00f3mez", "PatriciaBaeza-Capetillo", "MarkDedden", "JesusAguirre-Hernandez", "Samara AT\u00e9llez-Camacho", "Roc\u00edoS\u00e1nchez-Urbina", "GuillermoAquino-Jarquin", "Javier TGranados-Riveron"], "doi": "10.1002/jgm.3117"}

{"title": "Detection and genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii in wild canids in Serbia.", "abstract": "To gain insight into the population structure of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii in wildlife in Serbia, multiplex nested PCR- RFLP was performed on T. gondii DNA positive samples of heart tissue of three wild canid species, including red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), golden jackals (Canis aureus) and grey wolves (Canis lupus). Out of 110 samples (28 red foxes, 72 golden jackals, 10 wolves), 30 (27.3%) were positive for T. gondii DNA, of which 24 were genotyped (nine red foxes, 13 golden jackals and two wolves). The results showed a large dominance of lineage II (n\u202f=\u202f20, 83.4%) over lineage III (n\u202f=\u202f4, 16.7%) strains. Lineage II comprised four archetypes, 14 variants and one which remained undetermined, while within lineage III there were three archetypes and one variant strain. However, a notable difference in diversity was observed among the examined canids, with eight (88.9%) of the nine strains detected in red foxes distinct, vs. six (46.1%) distinct strains of the 13 detected in golden jackals. Since anthropogenic food sources are a major reservoir of archetypal lineage II and III T. gondii strains, the results suggest that the golden jackal may be outcompeting the red fox, forcing it to hunt wild mammals and birds for sustenance, thereby increasing its chances of infection with variant strains. In addition to presenting the first data on the T. gondii population structure in wild canids in Serbia, this is the first report ever on T. gondii genotypes in golden jackals, a species with an increasing presence in Europe and another important reservoir of domestically circulating T. gondii strains.", "journal": "Parasitology international", "date": "2019-08-14", "authors": ["AleksandraUzelac", "IvanaKlun", "Du\u0161ko\u0106irovi\u0107", "AleksandraPenezi\u0107", "Vladimir\u0106irkovi\u0107", "OlgicaDjurkovi\u0107-Djakovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.1016/j.parint.2019.101973"}

In the Biowire II platform, cardiac tissues are suspended between a pair of poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) citrate) (POMaC) wires. Noninvasive functional readouts are realized on the basis of the deflection of the intrinsically fluorescent polymer. The disease model is constructed to recapitulate contractile, biomechanical, and electrophysiological complexities of fibrotic myocardium. Additionally, we constructed a heteropolar integrated model with fibrotic and healthy cardiac tissues coupled together. The integrated model captures the regional heterogeneity of scar lesion, border zone, and adjacent healthy myocardium.

{"title": "Substrate Stiffness, Cell Anisotropy, and Cell-Cell Contact Contribute to Enhanced Structural and Calcium Handling Properties of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) can be utilized to understand the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of heart disease, as well as to develop better interventions and treatments for this disease. However, these cells are structurally and functionally immature, which undermines some of their adequacy in modeling adult heart tissue. Previous studies with immature cardiomyocytes have shown that altering substrate stiffness, cell anisotropy, and/or cell-cell contact can enhance the contractile and structural maturation of hPSC-CMs. In this study, the structural and calcium handling properties of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were enhanced by exposure to a downselected combination of these three maturation stimuli. First, hESC-CMs were seeded onto substrates composed of two commercial formulations of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), Sylgard 184 and Sylgard 527, whose stiffness ranged from 5 kPa to 101 kPa. Upon analyzing the morphological and calcium transient properties of these cells, it was concluded that a 21 kPa substrate yielded cells with the highest degree of maturation. Next, these PDMS substrates were microcontact-printed with laminin to force the cultured cells into rod-shaped geometries using line patterns that were 12, 18, or 24 \u03bcm in width. We found that cells on the 18 and 24 \u03bcm pattern widths had structural and functional properties that were superior to those on the 12 \u03bcm pattern. The hESC-CMs were then seeded onto these line-stamped surfaces at a density of 500\u202f000 cells per 25-mm-diameter substrate, to enable the formation of cell-cell contacts at their distal ends. We discovered that this combination of culture conditions resulted in cells that were more structurally and functionally mature than those that were only exposed to one or two stimuli. Our results suggest that downselecting a combination of mechanobiological stimuli could prove to be an effective means of maturing hPSC-CMs in vitro.", "journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "date": "2019-08-12", "authors": ["Marita LRodriguez", "Kevin MBeussman", "Katherine SChun", "Melissa SWalzer", "XiulanYang", "Charles EMurry", "Nathan JSniadecki"], "doi": "10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b01256"}
{"title": "Matrix-guided control of mitochondrial function in cardiac myocytes.", "abstract": "In ventricular myocardium, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a hallmark of physiological and pathological growth, coincident with metabolic rewiring of cardiac myocytes. However, the direct impact of the biochemical and mechanical properties of the ECM on the metabolic function of cardiac myocytes is mostly unknown. Furthermore, understanding the impact of distinct biomaterials on cardiac myocyte metabolism is critical for engineering physiologically-relevant models of healthy and diseased myocardium. For these reasons, we systematically measured morphological and metabolic responses of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes cultured on fibronectin- or gelatin-coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) of three elastic moduli and gelatin hydrogels with four elastic moduli. On all substrates, total protein content, cell morphology, and the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA were preserved. Cytotoxicity was low on all substrates, although slightly higher on PDMS compared to gelatin hydrogels. We also quantified oxygen consumption rates and extracellular acidification rates using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. Our data indicate that several metrics associated with baseline glycolysis and baseline and maximum mitochondrial function are enhanced when cardiac myocytes are cultured on gelatin hydrogels compared to all PDMS substrates, irrespective of substrate rigidity. These results yield new insights into how mechanical and biochemical cues provided by the ECM impact mitochondrial function in cardiac myocytes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cardiac development and disease are associated with remodeling of the extracellular matrix coincident with metabolic rewiring of cardiac myocytes. However, little is known about the direct impact of the biochemical and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix on the metabolic function of cardiac myocytes. In this study, oxygen consumption rates were measured in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes maintained on several commonly-used biomaterial substrates to reveal new relationships between the extracellular matrix and cardiac myocyte metabolism. Several mitochondrial parameters were enhanced on gelatin hydrogels compared to synthetic PDMS substrates. These data are important for comprehensively understanding matrix-regulation of cardiac myocyte physiology. Additionally, these data should be considered when selecting scaffolds for engineering in vitro cardiac tissue models.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2019-08-12", "authors": ["Davi MLyra-Leite", "Allen MAndres", "NathanCho", "Andrew PPetersen", "Nethika RAriyasinghe", "Suyon SarahKim", "Roberta AGottlieb", "Megan LMcCain"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2019.08.007"}

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers the potential to provide valuable, high-resolution imaging of cardiac tissue. However, there is a lack of comprehensive OCT imaging data of the human heart, which could improve identification of structural substrates underlying cardiac abnormalities. The objective of this study was to provide qualitative and quantitative analysis of OCT image features throughout the human heart. Fifty human hearts were acquired, and tissues from all chambers were imaged with OCT. Histology was obtained to verify tissue composition. Statistical differences between OCT image features corresponding to different tissue types and chambers were estimated using analysis of variance. OCT imaging provided features that were able to distinguish structures such as thickened collagen, as well as adipose tissue and fibrotic myocardium. Statistically significant differences were found between atria and ventricles in attenuation coefficient, and between adipose and all other tissue types.

{"title": "Akt1-mediated CPR cooling protection targets regulators of metabolism, inflammation and contractile function in mouse cardiac arrest.", "abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia initiated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in pre-clinical studies appears to be highly protective against sudden cardiac arrest injury. Given the challenges to implementing CPR cooling clinically, insights into its critical mechanisms of protection could guide development of new CPR drugs that mimic hypothermia effects without the need for physical cooling. Here, we used Akt1-deficient mice that lose CPR hypothermia protection to identify hypothermia targets. Adult female C57BL/6 mice (Akt1+/+ and Akt1+/-) underwent 8 min of KCl-induced asystolic arrest and were randomized to receive hypothermia (30 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) or normothermia. Hypothermia was initiated during CPR and extended for 1 h after resuscitation. Neurologically scored survival was measured at 72 h. Other outcomes included mean arterial pressure and target measures in heart and brain related to contractile function, glucose utilization and inflammation. Compared to northothermia, hypothermia improved both 2h mean arterial pressure and 72h neurologically intact survival in Akt1+/+ mice but not in Akt1+/- mice. In Akt1+/+ mice, hypothermia increased Akt and GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, pyruvate dehydrogenase activation, and NAD+ and ATP production while decreasing I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and NF-\u03baB activity in both heart and brain at 30 min after CPR. It also increased phospholamban phosphorylation in heart tissue. Further, hypothermia reduced metabolic and inflammatory blood markers lactate and Pre-B cell Colony Enhancing Factor. Despite hypothermia treatment, all these effects were reversed in Akt1+/- mice. Taken together, drugs that target Akt1 and its effectors may have the potential to mimic hypothermia-like protection to improve sudden cardiac arrest survival when administered during CPR.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2019-08-10", "authors": ["JingLi", "XiangdongZhu", "HuashanWang", "ChunpeiLee", "Sy-JouChen", "YuanyuQian", "MeiHan", "RyanBunney", "David GBeiser", "Terry LVanden Hoek"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0220604\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e31823ac046\n10.1007/s00134-004-2425-z\n10.1161/01.cir.0000023891.80661.ad\n10.1152/ajpheart.1989.257.6.H1860\n10.1161/hc4801.100038\n10.1161/01.cir.91.7.2071\n10.1002/jnr.23740\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2008.07.019\n10.1152/ajpheart.1998.274.3.H786\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000131940.19833.85\n10.1056/NEJMoa003289\n10.1152/ajpheart.00994.2009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.848424\n10.1152/ajpheart.00187.2010\n10.1006/excr.1999.4690\n10.1161/01.res.0000022200.71892.9f\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095622\n10.1152/ajpheart.00748.2014\n10.1097/TA.0b013e31821280c5\n10.1074/jbc.M109.036566\n10.1073/pnas.93.7.2719\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.07.007\n10.1042/CS20090557\n10.1016/j.tem.2008.10.004\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000000656\n10.1038/nrm1151\n10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02083.x\n10.1510/icvts.2004.097188\n10.1152/ajpheart.1991.261.4.H1005\n10.1152/ajpheart.1999.277.6.H2321\n10.1152/ajpheart.00302.2009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185046\n10.1161/01.res.65.4.1045\n10.1074/jbc.273.13.7201\n10.1074/jbc.M302094200\n10.1152/ajpendo.00526.2002\n10.1016/j.ccell.2016.07.004\n10.1159/000332326\n10.1007/s00134-004-2336-z\n10.1097/01.WCB.0000059566.39780.8D\n10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.001\n10.1016/j.cryobiol.2008.08.005\n10.1016/0304-4157(89)90007-5\n10.1128/JVI.00806-08\n10.1161/hh2201.099452\n10.1074/jbc.M105264200\n10.1089/neu.2011.1751\n10.1096/fj.12-226225\n10.1126/scisignal.2000343\n10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.08.038"}

Isolated rat hearts were perfused with citrate-coated magnetic nanoparticles (CiMNPs), citrate albumin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (CiAlbMNPs), bare magnetic nanoparticles (BaMNPs), and albumin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (AlbMNPs). CiMNPs induce a transient decrease in the left ventricular end-systolic pressure, +dP/dt and -dP/dt. These effects were not worsened by albumin coating. BaMNPs significantly increased the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and perfusion pressure and decreased the +dP/dt and -dP/dt. These effects were completely absent in hearts perfused with AlbMNPs. None of the MNPs changed heart rate or arterial blood pressure in conscious rats. Magnetic signals in isolated hearts perfused with BaMNPs were significantly higher than AlbMNPs perfused hearts. However, the magnetic signal in heart tissue was similar when the MNPs were infused in conscious rats. These data indicate that albumin-coated can reduce cardiovascular effects of MNPs.

Using quantitative proteomics analysis, we demonstrate widespread molecular defects in heart tissue from the Taiwanese mouse model of severe SMA. We identify increased levels of lamin A/C as a robust molecular phenotype in the heart of SMA mice and show that lamin A/C dysregulation is also apparent in SMA patient fibroblast cells and other tissues from SMA mice. Lamin A/C expression was regulated in vitro by knockdown of the E1 ubiquitination factor ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1, a key downstream mediator of SMN-dependent disease pathways, converging on \u03b2-catenin signaling. Increased levels of lamin A are known to increase the rigidity of nuclei, inevitably disrupting contractile activity in cardiomyocytes. The increased lamin A/C levels in the hearts of SMA mice therefore provide a likely mechanism explaining morphological and functional cardiac defects, leading to blood pooling. Therapeutic strategies directed at lamin A/C may therefore offer a new approach to target cardiac pathology in SMA.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2019-08-10", "authors": ["Darija\u0160olti\u0107", "Hannah KShorrock", "HazelAllardyce", "Emma LWilson", "IanHolt", "Silvia ASynowsky", "Sally LShirran", "Simon HParson", "Thomas HGillingwater", "Heidi RFuller"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddz195"}

Hypertension was induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt administration in uninephrectomized rats for 6 weeks. LXR agonist GW3965 (3-{3-[(2-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-(2,2-diphenyl-ethyl)-amino]-propoxy}-phenyl)-acetic acid was given for the past week. Rhythmic activity and contractions of the isolated heart tissues were recorded. Biochemical parameters were assessed in ventricular tissue and plasma samples. Cardiac expressions of various proteins were examined, and histopathological evaluation was performed in the left ventricle and liver. GW3965 reduced systolic blood pressure and enhanced noradrenaline-stimulated papillary muscle contraction induced by DOCA-salt + uninephrectomy. Plasma and tissue total antioxidant capacity (TAC) increased and tissue 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels decreased in the DOCA-salt group. GW3965 elevated plasma and tissue TAC levels in both of groups.

{"title": "Detrimental effects of chemotherapy on human coronary microvascular function.", "abstract": "Chemotherapy (CT) is a necessary treatment to prevent the growth and survival of cancer cells. However, CT has a well-established adverse impact on the cardiovascular (CV) system, even years after cessation of treatment. The effects of CT drugs on tumor vasculature have been the focus of much research, but little evidence exists showing the effects on the host microcirculation. Microvascular (MV) dysfunction is an early indicator of numerous CV disease phenotypes, including heart failure. The goal of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of doxorubicin (Dox) on human coronary MV function. To study the effect of CT on the cardiac MV function, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), pharmacologically-induced endothelial dependent dilation to acetylcholine (ACh), and smooth muscle-dependent dilation to papaverine were investigated. Vessels were freshly isolated from atrial appendages of adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery or from cardiac tissue of pediatric patients, collected at the time of surgery to repair congenital heart defects. Isolated vessels were incubated in endothelial culture medium containing vehicle or Dox (100 nm, 15-20 h) and used to measure dilator function by video microscopy. Ex vivo treatment of adult human coronary microvessels with Dox significantly impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Conversely, in pediatric coronary microvessels, Dox-induced impairment of FMD was significantly reduced in comparison with adult subjects. In both adult and pediatric coronary microvessels, ACh-induced constriction was reversed into dilation in the presence of Dox. Smooth muscle-dependent dilation remained unchanged in all groups tested.

SPX level is closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as age, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes; however, its physiological significance in the cardiovascular system remains mostly undefined. We therefore here investigated the roles of SPX in regulating hypoxia-induced alterations in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. We firstly confirmed that SPX is expressed in human and mouse cardiac tissue and documented that exposure to hypoxia in vitro reduces SPX level in rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes and primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). We then treated primary NRVMs with SPX before exposure to hypoxia, which (1) promoted fatty acid metabolism by enhancing expression of FAT/CD36, CPT1, ACADM, and PPAR-a and PGC1-a; (2) did not improve impaired glucose uptake; and (3) significantly prevented the downregulation of TFAM and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex and restrained UCP2 level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thus enhancing ATP level in cardiomyocytes.

The identification of new genetic risk factors that predispose to SADS is important, because they may contribute to establish the diagnosis and increase the understanding of disease pathways underlying SADS. Pathogenic mutations in the protein coding regions of cardiac genes were found in relation to SADS. However, much remains unknown about variants in non-coding regions of the genome.\nIn this study, we explored the potential of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) to find DNA variants in SCD victims with structural normal hearts. With focus on the non-coding regulatory regions, we re-examined a cohort of 13 SADS and sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) victims without disease causing DNA variants in recognized cardiac genes. The genetic re-examination of DNA was carried out using frozen tissue samples and WTS was carried out using five distinct formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) cardiac tissue samples from each individual, including anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle, ventricular papillary muscle, septum, and the right ventricle. We identified 23 candidate variants in regulatory sequences of cardiac genes, including a variant in the promotor region of NEXN, c.-194A>G, that was found to be statistically significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) associated with decreased expression of NEXN and cardiac hypertrophy.\nWith the use of post-mortem FFPE tissues, we highlight the potential of using WTS investigations and compare gene expression levels with DNA variation in regulatory non-coding regions of the genome for a better understanding of the genetics of cardiac diseases leading to SCD.", "journal": "International journal of legal medicine", "date": "2019-08-09", "authors": ["Jeppe DAndersen", "Stine BJacobsen", "Linea CTruds\u00f8", "Marie-LouiseKampmann", "JytteBanner", "NielsMorling"], "doi": "10.1007/s00414-019-02127-9\n10.1007/s00414-014-0966-4\n10.1093/europace/euw435\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv063\n10.1056/NEJMoa1510687\n10.1007/s00428-017-2221-0\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.02.046\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304030\n10.1016/j.jacc.2018.01.030\n10.1038/ejhg.2016.118\n10.1038/ejhg.2016.199\n10.1007/s00414-018-1775-y\n10.1172/JCI62613\n10.1007/s12031-018-1066-6\n10.1371/journal.pone.0098187\n10.1371/journal.pone.0170632\n10.1038/s41467-017-02772-x\n10.1038/ejhg.2015.198\n10.1186/1756-0500-5-337\n10.1002/0471250953.bi1110s43\n10.1038/gim.2015.30\n10.1093/nar/gkx1098\n10.1038/nature13182\n10.1038/nature11247\n10.1038/nature14248\n10.1093/nar/gkl822\n10.1093/bioinformatics/18.2.333\n10.1093/nar/gkg605\n10.1093/nar/24.1.238\n10.1038/nature07730\n10.1089/1066527041410418\n10.1093/nar/gkt1028\n10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r84\n10.1038/nmeth.3505\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635\n10.1101/gr.135350.111\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp692\n10.1007/s00414-015-1261-8\n10.1056/NEJMoa052800\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2013.10.034\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.09.008\n10.1016/j.hlc.2017.02.010\n10.1093/nar/gkt1113\n10.1038/nm.2037\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.10.002\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.018\n10.1002/bdrb.10034"}

Cell death is one of the consequences of such damage, as well as diminution in nitric oxide (NO) content. This signaling molecule regulates the function of the cardiovascular system through dependent and independent effects of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The independent cGMP pathway involves post-translational modification of proteins by S-nitrosylation. Studies in vitro have shown that NO inhibits the activity of caspases and calpains through S-nitrosylation of a cysteine located in their catalytic site, so we propose to elucidate if the regulatory mechanisms of NO are related with changes in S-nitrosylation of cell death proteins in the ischemic-reperfused myocardium.

Moreover AE induced the upregulation of 22 abundantly expressed microRNAs. Here, we aimed at evaluating the functional effect of inhibiting 7 promising microRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-31a-5p, miR-322-5p, miR-450a-5p, miR-140-3p and miR-132-3p) in a small-range screen. Singular transfection of locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based anti-miRs at 100\u2009nM (before the one week AE-procedure) led to a powerful reduction of the targeted microRNAs. Pretreatment with anti-miR-146b-5p, anti-miR-322-5p or anti-miR-450a-5p did not alter the AE-induced contractile decline, while anti-miR-31a-5p-pretreatment even worsened it. Anti-miR-21-5p and anti-miR-132-3p partially attenuated the AE-effect, confirming previous reports. LNA-anti-miR against miR-140-3p, a microRNA recently identified as a prognostic biomarker of cardiovascular disease, also attenuated the AE-effect. To simplify future in vitro experiments and to create an inhibitor for in vivo applications, we designed shorter miR-140-3p-inhibitors and encountered variable efficiency. Only the inhibitor that effectively repressed miR-140-3p was also protective against the AE-induced contractile decline.

{"title": "Learn from Your Elders: Developmental Biology Lessons to Guide Maturation of Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a multifaceted platform to study cardiac developmental biology, understand disease mechanisms, and develop novel therapies. Remarkable progress over the last two decades has led to methods to obtain highly pure hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) with reasonable ease and scalability. Nevertheless, a major bottleneck for the translational application of hPSC-CMs is their immature phenotype, resembling that of early fetal cardiomyocytes. Overall, bona fide maturation of hPSC-CMs represents one of the most significant goals facing the field today. Developmental biology studies have been pivotal in understanding the mechanisms to differentiate hPSC-CMs. Similarly, evaluation of developmental cues such as electrical and mechanical activities or neurohormonal and metabolic stimulations revealed the importance of these pathways in cardiomyocyte physiological maturation. Those signals cooperate and dictate the size and the performance of the developing heart. Likewise, this orchestra of stimuli is important in promoting hPSC-CM maturation, as demonstrated by current in vitro maturation approaches. Different shades of adult-like phenotype are achieved by prolonging the time in culture, electromechanical stimulation, patterned substrates, microRNA manipulation, neurohormonal or metabolic stimulation, and generation of human-engineered heart tissue (hEHT). However, mirroring this extremely dynamic environment is challenging, and reproducibility and scalability of these approaches represent the major obstacles for an efficient production of mature hPSC-CMs. For this reason, understanding the pattern behind the mechanisms elicited during the late gestational and early postnatal stages not only will provide new insights into postnatal development but also potentially offer new scalable and efficient approaches to mature hPSC-CMs.", "journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "date": "2019-08-08", "authors": ["SilviaMarchian\u00f2", "AlessandroBertero", "Charles EMurry"], "doi": "10.1007/s00246-019-02165-5"}

That promise has been tempered by the observation that hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) typically retain a fetal-like phenotype, raising concern about the translatability of the in vitro data obtained to drug safety, discovery, and development studies. The Biowire II platform was used to generate 3D engineered cardiac tissues (ECTs) from hiPSC-CMs and cardiac fibroblasts. Long term electrical stimulation was employed to obtain ECTs that possess a phenotype like that of adult human myocardium including a lack of spontaneous beating, the presence of a positive force-frequency response from 1 to 4\u2009Hz and prominent postrest potentiation. Pharmacology studies were performed in the ECTs to confirm the presence and functionality of pathways that modulate cardiac contractility in humans. Canonical responses were observed for compounds that act via the \u03b2-adrenergic/cAMP-mediated pathway, eg, isoproterenol and milrinone; the L-type calcium channel, eg, FPL64176 and nifedipine; and indirectly effect intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, eg, digoxin. Expected positive inotropic responses were observed for compounds that modulate proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, eg, omecamtiv mecarbil and levosimendan. ECTs generated in the Biowire II platform display adult-like properties and have canonical responses to cardiotherapeutic and cardiotoxic agents that affect contractility in humans via a variety of mechanisms.

Through transcriptome analysis, we found that the transcription of 465 genes changed significantly, with 398 upregulated and 67 downregulated in the CPF-treated group, indicating that CPF exposure altered the transcription of genes. Among these altered genes, a number of genes were closely related to the glucose and lipid metabolism pathways.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions have recently been suggested to alleviate myocardial injury and ameliorate cardiac function. However, few studies have focused on the effects of MSCs in DCM. Therefore, we explored the effects of MSC-regulated macrophage polarization on myocardial repair in DCM.\nA DCM rat model was induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) administration and infused 4 times with MSCs. Rat blood and heart tissue were analyzed for blood glucose levels, lipid levels, echocardiography, histopathology, macrophage phenotype ratios and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. We mimicked chronic inflammation in vitro by inducing peritoneal macrophages with high glucose and LPS, then cocultured these macrophages with MSCs to explore the specific mechanism of MSCs on macrophage polarization.\nDCM rats exhibited abnormal blood glucose levels and lipid metabolism, cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. MSC infusion ameliorated metabolic abnormalities and preserved cardiac structure and function in DCM rats. Moreover, MSC infusion significantly increased the M2 phenotype macrophages and alleviated cardiac inflammation. Interestingly, this in vitro study revealed that the MSCs pretreated with a COX-2 inhibitor had little effect on M2 macrophage polarization, but this phenomenon could be reversed by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).\nOur results suggested that MSC infusions can protect against cardiac injury in DCM rats.

Here we present a novel strategy to produce multiscale conductive scaffolds with layer-specific fiber orientations for cardiac regeneration by combining solution-based and melt-based electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing techniques. Polycaprolactone (PCL) microfibers were printed by melt-based EHD printing and the fiber orientation was flexibly controlled in a layer-by-layer manner according to user-specific design. The as-printed microfibrous scaffolds can provide the seeded cells necessary contact cues to guide layer-specific cellular alignments. Sub-microscale conductive fibers were simultaneously incorporated inside the well-organized PCL scaffolds by solution-based EHD printing, which significantly improved the conductivity as well as the cellular adhesion and proliferation capacity. The multiscale conductive scaffolds can further direct the multiple-layer alignments of primary cardiomyocytes and facilitate cardiomyocyte-specific gene expressions, which exhibited enhanced synchronous beating behavior compared with pure microfibrous scaffolds. It is envisioned that the proposed hybrid EHD printing technique might provide a promising strategy to fabricate multifunctional micro/nanofibrous scaffolds with biomimetic architectures, electrical conductivity and even biosensing properties for the regeneration of electroactive tissues.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-08-06", "authors": ["QiLei", "JiankangHe", "DichenLi"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr04989d"}

The TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway is activated in the cardiac tissue of chronic phase patients and is associated with an increase in extracellular matrix protein expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of GW788388, a selective inhibitor of T\u03b2R1/ALK5, on cardiac function in an experimental model of chronic Chagas' heart disease. To this end, C57BL/6 mice were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (102 parasites from the Colombian strain) and treated orally with 3mg/kg GW788388 starting at 120 days post-infection (dpi), when 100% of the infected mice show cardiac damage, and following three distinct treatment schedules: i) single dose; ii) one dose per week; or iii) three doses per week during 30 days. The treatment with GW788388 improved several cardiac parameters: reduced the prolonged PR and QTc intervals, increased heart rate, and reversed sinus arrhythmia, and atrial and atrioventricular conduction disorders. At 180 dpi, 30 days after treatment interruption, the GW3x-treated group remained in a better cardiac functional condition. Further, GW788388 treatment reversed the loss of connexin-43 enriched intercellular plaques and reduced fibrosis of the cardiac tissue. Inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway reduced TGF-\u03b2/pSmad2/3, increased MMP-9 and Sca-1, reduced TIMP-1/TIMP-2/TIMP-4, and partially restored GATA-6 and Tbox-5 transcription, supporting cardiac recovery. Moreover, GW788388 administration did not modify cardiac parasite load during the infection but reduced the migration of CD3+ cells to the heart tissue. Altogether, our data suggested that the single dose schedule was not as effective as the others and treatment three times per week during 30 days seems to be the most effective strategy. The therapeutic effects of GW788388 are promising and suggest a new possibility to treat cardiac fibrosis in the chronic phase of Chagas' heart disease by TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors.", "journal": "PLoS neglected tropical diseases", "date": "2019-08-01", "authors": ["Roberto RodriguesFerreira", "Rayane da SilvaAbreu", "GlauciaVilar-Pereira", "WimDegrave", "MarceloMeuser-Batista", "Nilma Val\u00e9ria CaldeiraFerreira", "Otac\u00edlioda Cruz Moreira", "Nat\u00e1lia Linsda Silva Gomes", "ElenMello de Souza", "Isalira PRamos", "SabineBailly", "Jean-JacquesFeige", "JoseliLannes-Vieira", "Tania Cde Ara\u00fajo-Jorge", "Mariana CaldasWaghabi"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pntd.0007602\n10.1016/j.molmed.2010.06.003\n10.1590/s0074-02762009000900021\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.10.033\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.03.110\n10.1126/science.1132292\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2013.06.003\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.01.006\n10.1086/345882\n10.1038/clpt.2012.102\n10.1016/j.jneuroim.2011.03.010\n10.1016/j.imbio.2016.01.009\n10.1016/j.cyto.2008.11.013\n10.1093/trstmh/trt050\n10.1016/s0002-9440(10)61189-3\n10.1128/AAC.00022-07\n10.1128/AAC.00580-09\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001696\n10.1056/NEJMoa1507574\n10.1093/femspd/ftv082\n10.1590/s0066-782x2001000100008\n10.1016/j.ahj.2006.12.017\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.882035\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1002645\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1004594\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0003659\n10.1021/jm0509905\n10.1128/AAC.02123-15\n10.3181/0707-MR-190\n10.1089/scd.2014.0197\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.06.004\n10.3109/08977194.2011.595714\n10.1111/j.1365-2613.2009.00670.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.05.046\n10.1590/s0074-02761991000200008\n10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.01.014\n10.1111/tmi.12002\n10.1016/j.micinf.2008.11.012\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0001644\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0005284\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.10.002\n10.1182/blood-2011-04-285981\n10.1017/erm.2016.2\n10.1093/cvr/cvu229\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.07.002\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.52\n10.1074/jbc.M310822200\n10.1371/journal.pntd.0000417\n10.1038/355242a0\n10.1093/intimm/8.1.13\n10.1007/BF01614765\n10.1007/s12094-012-0811-5"}

Another 20 mice with IL-6 gene knockout were enrolled into the MI + IL-6 KO group. The MI model was established by means of ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery of the mice. 28 d later, the survival status of the three groups of mice was recorded. In addition, the cardiac functions of each group of mice, including two-dimensional echocardiography, ejection fraction (EF%) and fractional shortening (FS%), were measured. The cross-sectional area and pathological change of the myocardial cells in cardiac tissues of each group of mice were detected via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Immunohistochemistry was applied to determine the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in each group of mouse cardiac tissues. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining was utilized to measure the content of M2 macrophages in each group of mouse cardiac tissues.\nThe 28-d survival rate of the mice with IL-6 gene knockout was remarkably higher than that of the wild-type mice (p<0.05). Furthermore, the cardiac functions of the mice in the MI + IL-6 KO group were superior to those in the MI group, with markedly improved FS% and EF% (p<0.05). According to the H&E staining results, the cross-sectional areas of the heart and myocardial cells were decreased notably in MI + IL-6 KO group compared with those in the MI group (p<0.05). The immunohistochemical staining results showed that IL-6 knockout could lower the MI-induced high expression of TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05), and Masson's trichrome staining indicated that IL-6 knockout could also repress the degree of cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, it was discovered through immunofluorescent staining that the mice in the MI + IL-6 KO group had markedly elevated content of M2 macrophages in cardiac tissues than those in the MI group (p<0.05).\nInhibiting IL-6 gene expression can prominently ameliorate the MI-induced myocardial remodeling, whose mechanism is possibly associated with the activation of M2 macrophages and reduced collagen production in fibroblast cells.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2019-08-01", "authors": ["RJing", "T-YLong", "WPan", "FLi", "Q-YXie"], "doi": "10.26355/eurrev_201907_18450"}

Chemokines and their receptors are crucial for the migration of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, which are the main IFN\u03b3 producers and cytotoxic effectors cells. Although the participation of chemokine ligands and receptors has been largely explored in viral infection, much less is known in infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. After T. cruzi infection, CXCR3 chemokine receptor is highly expressed on the surface of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Here, we hypothesized that CXCR3 is a key molecule for migration of parasite-specific CD8+ T-cells towards infected tissues, where they may play their effector activities. Using a model of induction of resistance to highly susceptible A/Sn mice using an ASP2-carrying DNA/adenovirus prime-boost strategy, we showed that CXCR3 expression was upregulated on CD8+ T-cells, which selectively migrated towards its ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10. Anti-CXCR3 administration reversed the vaccine-induced resistance to T. cruzi infection in a way associated with hampered cytotoxic activity and increased proapoptotic markers on the H2KK-restricted TEWETGQI-specific CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, CXCR3 receptor critically guided TEWETGQI-specific effector CD8+ T-cells to the infected heart tissue that express CXCL9 and CXCL10. Overall, our study pointed CXCR3 and its ligands as key molecules to drive T. cruzi-specific effector CD8+ T-cells into the infected heart tissue.

CA activities were significantly decreased in testis, liver, and heart tissues of rats given HSP, SA, SA+HSP-100, and SA+HSP-200 compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In liver tissue, AChE and BChE enzymes activities were significantly reduced given in all groups. In all tissues, \u03b1-Gly activity was reduced given in all groups. In the current study, aldose reductase enzyme activity was reduced significantly in testis, brain, and heart tissues of all groups compared to standard (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). PON1 enzyme activity was increased significantly in kidney and liver tissues of rats HSP groups and decreased SA groups compared to control. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: \u03b1-Glycosidase is the key enzyme involved in the digestion of the carbohydrate. Another enzyme \u03b1-amylase hydrolyzes the \u03b1-linked polysaccharide derivatives into oligosaccharide molecules, and \u03b1-glycosidase enzymes, which are characterized in small intestine, catalyze the final stage in the digestive mechanism of carbohydrate molecule to release absorbable monosaccharides like glucose. Conforming to the cholinergic hypothesis, impairment of the cholinergic pathways plays a good role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) problems with the regulation of traumatic brain injury and sleep. The AD is the main reason for dementia disease, and mild to moderate cases are generally treated with AChE inhibitors.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of MT in a murine ALI model.\nC57BL/6J mice (male, 10-12\u00a0weeks) were used in a model of ALI. Ischemia was induced by applying a tourniquet on the left hindlimb. After 2\u00a0hours of ischemia, the tourniquet was released, and reperfusion of the hindlimb was re-established; either vehicle alone (n\u00a0= 15) or vehicle containing mitochondria (n\u00a0= 33) was injected directly into all the muscles of the hindlimb.

To generate a clinically relevant sized tissue, the provisioning of a perfusable vascular network that provides nutrients to cells in the tissue is a major challenge. This review summarizes the recent vascularization strategies for engineering 3D cardiac tissues.\nConsiderable steps towards the generation of macroscopic sizes for engineered cardiac tissue with efficient vascular networks have been made within the past few years. Achieving a compact tissue with enough cardiomyocytes to provide functionality remains a challenging task. Achieving perfusion in engineered constructs with media that contain oxygen and nutrients at a clinically relevant tissue sizes remains the next frontier in tissue engineering. The provisioning of a functional vasculature is necessary for maintaining a high cell viability and functionality in engineered cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Modeling and simulation of cardiac electric activity in a human cardiac tissue with multiple ischemic zones.", "abstract": "In this work, a human ventricular model (ten Tusscher and Panfilov model) coupled with the tissue level monodomain model is used to analyze the influence of multiple myocardial ischemia on the human cardiac tissue. The existence and uniqueness of the ischemic model comprising the monodomain model with a discontinuous ionic model for the human cardiac tissue is discussed. The coupled system of partial differential equation and ordinary differential equations are solved numerically using [Formula: see text] finite elements in space and Backward Euler finite difference scheme in time. The apriori finite element error estimate for the numerical scheme has been shown to be of [Formula: see text]. Essentially, we evaluate the impact of the increasing size of the ischemic region and the presence of the multiple ischemic regions having equal or different intensities on the neighboring healthy part of the cardiac tissue. We examine both the individual and the combined influence of two types of ischemia, Hyperkalemia (with the variation of the extracellular potassium ion concentration, [Formula: see text]) and Hypoxia (with the variation of intracellular Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration via parameter [Formula: see text]) on the cardiac electrical activity of cardiac tissue. We observe that with the increase in the ischemic region size by a factor five times, there is an additional almost 10% drop in the action potential duration (APD) in the neighboring healthy regions. The combined effect of Hyperkalemia and Hypoxia brings an additional 12% drop in APD in the ischemic subregions and an additional 5% drop in APD in the neighboring healthy part of the cardic tissue in comparison to the only Hyperkalemic ischemia. When the Hyperkalemic and/or Hypoxic degeneracy of a ischemic zone is non-uniform then innercore degeneracy has greater influence on resting potential and APD of outercore of variable intensity ischemic zone than the other way. Also, increasing the number of ischemic subregions from 2 to 4 leads to a 4% drop in APD.", "journal": "Journal of mathematical biology", "date": "2019-07-29", "authors": ["MeenaPargaei", "B VRathish Kumar", "Luca FPavarino"], "doi": "10.1007/s00285-019-01403-x"}

At week 7 and for 10\u00a0weeks, diosmin (50\u00a0mg/kg, PO) or crocin (50\u00a0mg/kg, PO) was administered daily. Non-invasive blood pressure (BP) was recorded in conscious animals. Thoracic aorta (macro vessels) and kidney (micro vessels) concentration-response curves for phenylephrine (PE) and acetylcholine (ACh) were analyzed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were recorded. Blood glucose level, serum insulin level, troponin T, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were measured. In addition, histological examination of aorta and heart tissues was performed. Diosmin and crocin alleviated cardio-vascular complications associated with MS. This is manifested in improvement of systolic and diastolic BP and ECG parameters. They ameliorated MS-induced exaggerated contractility to PE and improved the impaired dilatation to Ach in macro and micro vasculature. Diosmin and crocin reduced the elevated serum levels of insulin, AGEs, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA and reversed MS-induced structural changes of aorta and cardiac tissues.

In this scenario, scaffolds are platforms that can realistically mimic the natural architecture of the heart, and they add biorealism to in vitro models. This paper reports a novel and robust technique to fabricate cardiovascular-mimetic scaffolds based on Parylene C and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Parylene C is employed as a mask material for inducing hybrid and non-hybrid micropatterns to the PDMS layer. Hybrid architectures present striped hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces, whereas non-hybrid scaffolds only corrugated topographies. Herein, we demonstrate that wavy features on PDMS can be obtained at the micro- and nanoscale and that PDMS can be integrated into the microfabrication process without changing its intrinsic physical properties.

{"title": "Theoretical Modeling and Experimental Detection of the Extracellular Phasic Impedance Modulation in Rabbit Hearts.", "abstract": "Theoretical cardiac electrophysiology focuses on the dynamics of the membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum ion currents; however, passive (e.g., membrane capacitance) and quasi-active (response to small signals) properties of the cardiac sarcolemma, which are quantified by impedance, are also important in determining the behavior of cardiac tissue. Theoretically, impedance varies in the different phases of a cardiac cycle. Our goal in this study was to numerically predict and experimentally validate these phasic changes. We calculated the expected impedance signal using analytic methods (for generic ionic models) and numerical computation (for a rabbit ventricular ionic model). Cardiac impedance is dependent on the phase of the action potential, with multiple deflections caused by a sequential activation and inactivation of various membrane channels. The two main channels shaping the impedance signal are the sodium channel causing a sharp and transient drop at the onset of action potential and the inward rectifying potassium channel causing an increase in impedance during the plateau phase.

Acacia hydaspica is a natural shrub with diverse bioactivities. Acacia hydaspica ethyl acetate extract (AHE) ameliorated drug-induced cardiotoxicity in animals with anti-oxidative mechanisms. Current study aimed to evaluate the protective potential of A. hydaspica against cisplatin-induced myocardial injury.\nRats were indiscriminately distributed into six groups (n\u00a0=\u20096). Group 1: control; Groups 2: Injected with CP (7.5\u2009mg/kg bw, i.p, single dose) on day 16; Group 3: Treated for 21\u2009days with AHE (400\u2009mg/kg b.w, oral); Group 4: Received CP injection on day 16 and treated with AHE for 5\u2009days post injection; Group 5: Received AHE (400\u2009mg/kg b.w/day, p.o.) for 21\u2009days and CP (7.5\u2009mg/kg b.w., i.p.) on day 16; Group 6: Treated with silymarin (100\u2009mg/kg b.w., p.o.) after 1 day interval for 21\u2009days and CP injection (7.5\u2009mg/kg b.w., i.p.) on day 16. On 22nd day, the animals were sacrificed and their heart tissues were removed. Cisplatin induced cardiac toxicity and the influence of AHE were evaluated by examination of serum cardiac function markers, cardiac tissue antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress markers and histology.\nCP inoculation considerably altered cardiac function biomarkers in serum and diminished the antioxidant enzymes levels, while increased oxidative stress biomarkers in cardiac tissues AHE treatment attenuated CP-induced deteriorations in creatine kinase (CK), Creatine kinase isoenzymes MB (CK-MB), cardiac Troponin I (cTNI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and ameliorated cardiac oxidative stress markers as evidenced by decreasing lipid peroxidation, H\nResults demonstrate that AHE attenuated CP induce cardiotoxicity.

However, the mechanism underlying myocardial depression is still unclear. Whether circular RNA (circRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) profiles differ between patients with and without myocardial depression is unknown. We generated a hypodynamic septic shock model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adolescent rats. A total of 12 rats were utilized and heart tissue from each was collected. RNA sequencing was performed on left ventricular tissue. We focused on features of circRNAs and miRNAs, predicting their function by bioinformatic analysis and constructing circRNA-associated and miRNA-associated regulatory networks in heart tissue. We detected 851 circRNAs in heart samples, and 11 showed differential expression. A total of 639 annotated miRNAs and 91 novel miRNAs were explored including 78 showing differential expression between the two groups. We then constructed the most comprehensive circRNA-associated and miRNA-associated networks to explore their regulatory relationship in septic heart tissue, and demonstrated that different networks could potentially participate in and regulate the pathological process of sepsis. Furthermore, gene ontology term enrichment indicated miRNAs, and miRNA-mRNA networks could be associated with regulation and metabolic process, or influence cellular functions. The construction of regulator networks could improve the understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial depression.

In order to decide optimum conditions for the size of the vacuum holes and the vacuum pressure, various sized vacuum holes and vacuum pressures were applied to a normal human cardiac fibroblast 3D tissue. From the results, we confirmed that a square shape with 100 \u00b5m sides was better for fixing the 3D tissue.

We also show that the simulated spiral tip dynamics, including chaotic trajectories, can be captured by a simple particle model which only describes the dynamics of the spiral tip.

We found that both klotho and the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor LY364947 significantly inhibited cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction in Ang II-infused mice, as evidenced by the ratios of heart weight to body weight (HW/BW), heart weight to tibial length (HW/TL), cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, fibrotic area, and expression of prohypertrophic genes (ANP, \u03b2-MHC) and fibrotic marker genes (\u03b1-SMA, collagen I), echocardiographic parameters. Meanwhile, klotho also significantly inhibited Ang II-induced protein expression of TGF-\u03b21 and phosphorylated Smad2/3 in the heart tissues and cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and proliferation and activation of cardiac fibroblasts were markedly inhibited by klotho, LY364947 or the miR-132 inhibitor anti-miR-132. Both klotho and the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor LY364947 downregulated the miR-132 expression. Additionally, klotho decreased Ang II-induced protein expressions of cardiac fibroblast growth factor (FGF)23 in vivo and in vitro. The decreased protein levels of klotho in serum and renal tissues of Ang II-infused mice were elevated by klotho. Klotho downregulated the protein levels of TGF-\u03b21 in renal tissues of Ang II-infused mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that klotho prevents Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction through modifying the TGF-\u03b21-miR-132 axis, providing an experimental basis for clinical treatment on cardiac remodeling.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2019-07-22", "authors": ["JieqiongDing", "QiongTang", "BinhuaLuo", "LijunZhang", "LiLin", "LuHan", "MiaomiaoHao", "MingyueLi", "LiangzhuYu", "MincaiLi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.172549"}

Piceatannol (PIC) has protective effects against cardiovascular disease; however, it remains unknown whether it also protects against DCM. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate the effects of PIC on the viability of high glucose (HG)-induced H9C2 cells. Protein expression and mRNA levels were detected by western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. In vivo, physical and biochemical analyses, together with transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements, were used to detect the effects of PIC treatment on cardiac function in DCM rats. Reactive oxygen species production was determined using an ELISA kit, and inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-PCR. Pathological changes were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, and TUNEL staining. According to the results, PIC treatment improved cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in HG-induced H9C2 cardiac myoblasts. In addition, PIC not only attenuated the over-production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), but also improved the expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). Importantly, knockdown of Nrf2 suppressed PIC-mediated activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and abolished its anti-inflammatory effects. In vivo, oral administration of PIC suppressed STZ-induced inflammation, oxidative stress hypertrophy, fibrosis(myocardial collagen volume fraction in 5\u202fmg/kg and 10\u202fmg/kg PIC group was decreased 25.83% and 55.61% compared with the DM group), and apoptosis(Caspase-3 level in 5\u202fmg/kg and 10\u202fmg/kg PIC group was decreased 13.21% and 33.91% compared with the DM group), thereby relieving cardiac dysfunction and improving both fibrosis and pathological changes in cardiac tissues of diabetic rats.

In recent years, considerable effort has been invested in optimizing cell delivery strategies to advance cell transplantation therapies to restore heart function for example after an infarct. A particular issue is that the implantation of cells using a non-electroconductive matrix potentially causes arrhythmia. Here, we demonstrate that our hydrazide-functionalized nanotubes-pericardial matrix-derived electroconductive biohybrid hydrogel provides a suitable environment for maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes exhibited an improved contraction amplitude (>500%) on conductive hydrogels compared to cells cultured on Matrigel\u00ae. This was accompanied by increased cellular alignment, enhanced connexin 43 expression, and improved sarcomere organization suggesting maturation of the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Sarcomeric length of these cells increased from 1.3 to 1.7 \u03bcm. Moreover, 3D cell-laden engineered tissues exhibited enhanced calcium handling as well as positive response to external electrical and pharmaceutical stimulation.

Despite the existence of evidence of the harmful effects of hookah smoke on various systems of the body, especially the cardiovascular system, its simultaneous effect with exercise training has not been well studied. We assessed the effects of WTS exposure with/without swimming exercise on blood pressure (BP), and heart histology and mechanical performance in male Wistar rats.\nThe animals were divided into 4 groups of sedentary control (CTL), waterpipe tobacco smoking (S), mild endurance swimming exercise training (Ex), and waterpipe smoking plus exercise (S + Ex). The duration of WTS and exercise was 8 weeks.\nBP and heart rate (HR) did not show a significant difference among the groups. WTS increased the TNF-\u03b1 level of the heart (P < 0.05 vs. CTL) and cardiac tissue lesions (P < 0.05 vs. CTL), and reduced +dP/dt max, -dp/dt max, and heart contractility indices (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively, vs. CTL and Ex groups). It also increased the Tau index (P < 0.05 vs. CTL; P < 0.01 vs. Ex groups) of the left ventricle. However, the combination of exercise and WTS reduced the TNF-\u03b1 level, improved the heart activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase enzymes, and prevented the negative effects of smoking on heart function and morphology.\nMild exercise prevents WTS-induced left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction partly via improvement of antioxidants and attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "journal": "Addiction & health", "date": "2019-07-20", "authors": ["Mohammad RezaNakhaee", "SiyavashJoukar", "Mohammad RezaZolfaghari", "FarzanehRostamzadeh", "YaserMasoumi-Ardakani", "MaryamIranpour", "MozhdehNazari"], "doi": "10.22122/ahj.v11i2.234"}
{"title": "Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) plays a pivotal role in cardiomyocyte survival through a Bnip3-dependent mechanism.", "abstract": "Prevention of cardiomyocyte death is an important therapeutic strategy for heart failure. In this study, we focused on translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), a highly conserved protein that is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues, including heart. TCTP plays pivotal roles in survival of certain cell types, but its function in cardiomyocytes has not been examined. We aimed to clarify the role of TCTP in cardiomyocyte survival and the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrated that downregulation of TCTP with siRNA induced cell death of cardiomyocytes with apoptotic and autophagic features, accompanied with mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. TCTP loss did not induce cell death of cardiac fibroblasts. Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) was found to mediate the TCTP-loss-induced cardiomyocyte death. In exploring the clinical significance of the TCTP expression in the heart, we found that DOX treatment markedly downregulated the protein expression of TCTP in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mouse heart tissue. Exogenous rescue of TCTP expression attenuated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death. In mice, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of TCTP resulted in decreased susceptibility to DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, accompanied with attenuated induction of Bnip3. Dihydroartemisinin, a pharmacological TCTP inhibitor, induced development of heart failure and cardiomyocyte death in control mice, but not in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific TCTP overexpression. Our findings revealed TCTP has a pivotal role in cardiomyocyte survival, at least in part through a Bnip3-dependent mechanism.

The rats were randomly divided into five groups, each group consisting of six rats. Group I were treated as control rats, group II received NRD (200\u2009mg/kg b.w.) by intragastric intubation for 21\u2009days, group III received ISO (60\u2009mg/kg b.w) subcutaneously (s.c) for two consecutive days on 22nd and 23rd day, group IV and V received NRD (100 and 200\u2009mg/kg b.w) as in group II and additionally ISO was given for two consecutive days (22nd and 23rd). On 24th day all the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the blood and heart samples were collected. In the present study, ISO-induced myocardial damage was indicated by the changes in body weight, heart weight and the cardiac and hepatic marker enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin T and I (cTnT, cTnI) in the serum. In addition, the levels of lipid peroxidation products such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), conjugated dines (CD), and lipid hydroperoxides (LHPs) increased significantly in the plasma and heart tissue. Activities of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in erythrocytes and heart tissue and the levels of nonenzymatic antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and reduced glutathione (GSH) in plasma and heart tissue were decreased in ISO-induced rats. Histopathological observations were also supported with the biochemical parameters. Pretreatment with NRD at different doses (100 and 200\u2009mg/kg b.w) for 21\u2009days prevented the above changes induced by ISO. The 200\u2009mg/kg b.w of NRD was more pronounced than the other dose and brought back all the above parameters near to normalcy.", "journal": "Drug development research", "date": "2019-07-18", "authors": ["LoordhuraniAsaikumar", "LakshmananVennila", "PalaniyandiAkila", "SubramanianSivasangari", "KaliyamoorthiKanimozhi", "VengatesanPremalatha", "GanapathiSindhu"], "doi": "10.1002/ddr.21564"}

Accumulating evidence indicates that the cardiotoxicity caused by the apoptotic machinery is partly regulated by miRNAs. The aim of this research is to investigate the role of miR-138-5p on hypoxia/reperfusion-induced heart injury.\nThe expression of miR-138-5p was determined in heart tissue from myocardial infarction patients and rats. Rats were transfection with a miR-138-5p inhibitor to silence miR-138-5p. The cardiac function of rats was detected via echocardiography. SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 expression in cardiac infarction was detected via quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analysis, while the TUNEL assay was used to determine myocardial apoptosis.\nOur observations showed that miR-138-5p expression was upregulated after the induction of myocardial infarction. The miR-138-5p inhibitor significantly improved cardiac function, increased the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1, and decreased the rate of myocardial apoptosis, whereas siRNA-SIRT1 reversed these protective effects.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR-138-5p could promote cardiac ischemia injury via inhibition of the silent information regulator 1 and peroxisome proliferator-initiated receptor gamma and coactivator 1 alpha (SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1) axis.", "journal": "Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

{"title": "Phosphodiesterase 5 Associates With \u03b22 Adrenergic Receptor to Modulate Cardiac Function in Type 2 Diabetic Hearts.", "abstract": "Background In murine heart failure models and in humans with diabetic-related heart hypertrophy, inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) by sildenafil improves cardiac outcomes. However, the mechanism by which sildenafil improves cardiac function is unclear. We have observed a relationship between PDE5 and \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR), which is characterized here as a novel mechanistic axis by which sildenafil improves symptoms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results Wild-type and \u03b22AR knockout mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) were treated with sildenafil, and echocardiogram analysis was performed. Cardiomyocytes were isolated for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, fluorescence resonant energy transfer, and proximity ligation assays; while heart tissues were implemented for biochemical and histological analyses. PDE5 selectively associates with \u03b22AR, but not \u03b21 adrenergic receptor, and inhibition of PDE5 with sildenafil restores the impaired response to adrenergic stimulation in HFD mice and isolated ventriculomyocytes. Sildenafil enhances \u03b2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR)-stimulated cGMP and cAMP signals in HFD myocytes. Consequently, inhibition of PDE5 leads to protein kinase G-, and to a lesser extent, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-dependent improvements in adrenergically stimulated E-C coupling. Deletion of \u03b22AR abolishes sildenafil's effect. Although the PDE5-\u03b22AR association is not altered in HFD, phosphodiesterase 3 displays an increased association with the \u03b22AR-PDE5 complex in HFD myocytes. Conclusions This study elucidates mechanisms by which the \u03b22AR-PDE5 axis can be targeted for treating diabetic cardiomyopathy. Inhibition of PDE5 enhances \u03b22AR stimulation of cGMP and cAMP signals, as well as protein kinase G-dependent E-C coupling in HFD myocytes.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2019-07-18", "authors": ["Toni MWest", "QingtongWang", "BingqingDeng", "YuZhang", "FedericaBarbagallo", "Gopireddy RReddy", "DanaChen", "Kyle SPhan", "BingXu", "AndresIsidori", "Yang KXiang"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.119.012273"}

We developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte-based platform to study the tissue-level properties of engineered human myocardium. We investigated pathogenic mechanisms in CPVT by combining this novel platform with genome editing.\nIn our model, CPVT tissues were vulnerable to developing reentrant rhythms when stimulated by rapid pacing and catecholamine, recapitulating hallmark features of the disease.

{"title": "Tracking adiponectin biodistribution via fluorescence molecular tomography indicates increased vascular permeability after streptozotocin-induced diabetes.", "abstract": "Adiponectin, a highly abundant polypeptide hormone in plasma, plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism in a wide variety of tissues, as well as providing important beneficial effects in diabetes, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. To act on target tissues, adiponectin must move from the circulation to the interstitial space, suggesting that vascular permeability plays an important role in regulating adiponectin action. To test this hypothesis, fluorescently labeled adiponectin was used to monitor its biodistribution in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZD). Adiponectin was, indeed, found to have increased sequestration in the highly fenestrated liver and other tissues within 90 min in STZD mice. In addition, increased myocardial adiponectin was detected and confirmed using computed tomography (CT) coregistration. This provided support of adiponectin delivery to affected cardiac tissue as a cardioprotective mechanism. Higher adiponectin content in the STZD heart tissues was further examined by ex vivo fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) imaging, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. In vitro mechanistic studies using an endothelial monolayer on inserts and three-dimensional microvascular networks on microfluidic chips further confirmed that adiponectin flux was increased by high glucose. However, in the in vitro model and mouse heart tissue, high glucose levels did not change adiponectin receptor levels. An examination of the tight junction (TJ) complex revealed a decrease in the TJ protein claudin (CLDN)-7 in high glucose-treated endothelial cells, and the functional significance of this change was underscored by increased endothelium permeability upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of ", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). There were five groups: C1-control (physiological saline 1\u2009ml/kg, i.p. one day), C2-control with daily physiological saline treatment (1\u2009ml/kg, i.p. 28 days), DM-diabetes mellitus (STZ 100\u2009mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. one day), FA-folic acid (5\u2009mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. 28 days), and DM+FA-diabetes mellitus and folic acid group (STZ 100\u2009mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. one day, and folic acid 5\u2009mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. 28 days). After four weeks, animal hearts were isolated for measurement of enzyme activities, as well as for histomorphometry analyses. An elevated glucose level and a decreased insulin level were obtained in the DM group. SOD, CAT, and MDH activities were elevated in the DM group, while there was no difference in LDH activity among the groups. In all tested groups, four LDH and three MDH isoforms were detected in the heart tissue, but with differences in their relative activities among the groups. Left ventricular cardiomyocyte transversal diameters were significantly smaller in both diabetic groups.

{"title": "Stretchable ECM Patch Enhances Stem Cell Delivery for Post-MI Cardiovascular Repair.", "abstract": "Current cell-based therapies administered after myocardial infarction (MI) show limited efficacy due to subpar cell retention in a dynamically beating heart. In particular, cardiac patches generally provide a cursory level of cell attachment due to the lack of an adequate microenvironment. From this perspective, decellularized cell-derived ECM (CDM) is attractive in its recapitulation of a natural biophysical environment for cells. Unfortunately, its weak physical property renders it difficult to retain in its original form, limiting its full potential. Here, a novel strategy to peel CDM off from its underlying substrate is proposed. By physically stamping it onto a polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel, the resulting stretchable extracellular matrix (ECM) membrane preserves the natural microenvironment of CDM, thereby conferring a biological interface to a viscoelastic membrane. Its various mechanical and biological properties are characterized and its capacity to improve cardiomyocyte functionality is demonstrated. Finally, evidence of enhanced stem cell delivery using the stretchable ECM membrane is presented, which leads to improved cardiac remodeling in a rat MI model. A new class of material based on natural CDM is envisioned for the enhanced delivery of cells and growth factors that have a known affinity with ECM.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2019-07-16", "authors": ["In GulKim", "Mintai PHwang", "Jin SilPark", "Su-HyunKim", "Jung-HyunKim", "Hyo JinKang", "RameshSubbiah", "Ung HyunKo", "Jennifer HShin", "Chong-HyunKim", "DonghoonChoi", "KwideokPark"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201900593"}

{"title": "Oral geranylgeranylacetone treatment increases heat shock protein expression in human atrial tissue.", "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important chaperones that regulate the maintenance of healthy protein quality control in the cell. Impairment of HSPs is associated with aging-related neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is a compound well known to increase HSPs through activation of heat shock factor-1 (HSF1). GGA increases HSPs in various tissues, but whether GGA can increase HSP expression in human heart tissue is unknown.\nThe purpose of this study was to test whether oral GGA treatment increases HSP expression in the atrial appendages of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nHSPB1, HSPA1, HSPD1, HSPA5, HSF1, and phosphorylated HSF1 levels were measured by western blot analysis in right and left atrial appendages (RAAs and LAAs, respectively) collected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who were treated with placebo (n = 13) or GGA 400 mg/da(n\u00a0=\u00a013) 3 days before surgery. Myofilament fractions were isolated from LAAs to determine the levels of HSPB1 and HSPA1 present in these fractions.\nGGA treatment significantly increased HSPB1 and HSPA1 expression levels in RAA and LAA compared to the placebo group, whereas HSF1, phosphorylated HSF1, HSPD1, and HSPA5 were unchanged. In addition, GGA treatment significantly enhanced HSPB1 levels at the myofilaments compared to placebo.\nThree days of GGA treatment is associated with higher HSPB1 and HSPA1 expression levels in RAA and LAA of patients undergoing CABG surgery and higher HSPB1 levels at the myofilaments.

{"title": "Heat shock protein inducer GGA*-59 reverses contractile and structural remodeling via restoration of the microtubule network in experimental Atrial Fibrillation.", "abstract": "Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common progressive tachyarrhythmia. AF progression is driven by abnormalities in electrical impulse formation and contractile function due to structural remodeling of cardiac tissue. Previous reports indicate that structural remodeling is rooted in derailment of protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a critical role in facilitating proteostasis. Hence, the HSP-inducing compound geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) and its derivatives protect against proteostasis derailment in experimental models for AF. Whether these compounds also accelerate reversibility from structural remodeling in tachypaced cardiomyocytes is unknown.\nTo investigate whether the potent HSP inducer GGA*-59 restores structural remodeling and contractile dysfunction in tachypaced cardiomyocytes and explore the underlying mechanisms.\nHL-1 cardiomyocytes post-treated with GGA*-59 or recombinant HSPB1 (rcHSPB1) revealed increased levels of HSPB1 expression and accelerated recovery from tachypacing (TP)-induced calcium transient (CaT) loss compared to non-treated cardiomyocytes. In addition, protein levels of the microtubule protein (acetylated) \u03b1-tubulin, and contractile proteins cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and troponin T (cTnT) were reduced after TP and significantly recovered by GGA*-59 or rcHSPB1 post-treatment. The mRNA levels of \u03b1-tubulin encoding genes, but not cardiac troponin genes, were reduced upon TP and during recovery, but significantly enhanced by GGA*-59 and rcHSPB1 post-treatment. In addition, TP increased calpain activity, which remained increased during recovery and GGA*-59 post-treatment. However, HDAC6 activity, which deacetylates \u03b1-tubulin resulting in microtubule disruption, was significantly increased after TP and during recovery, but normalized to control levels by GGA*-59 or rcHSPB1 post-treatment in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.\nOur results imply that the HSP inducer GGA*-59 and recombinant HSPB1 accelerate recovery from TP-induced structural remodeling and contractile dysfunction in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. GGA*-59 increases HSPB1 levels, represses HDAC6 activity and restores contractile protein and microtubule levels after TP, indicating that HSP-induction is an interesting target to accelerate recovery from AF-induced remodeling.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2019-07-16", "authors": ["XuHu", "JinLi", "Denise M Svan Marion", "DeliZhang", "Bianca J J MBrundel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.07.006"}

{"title": "Protective role of Roflumilast against cadmium-induced cardiotoxicity through inhibition of oxidative stress and NF-\u03baB signaling in rats.", "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd), a potent cardiotoxic environmental heavy metal, induces oxidative stress and membrane disturbances in cardiac myocytes. Phosphodiesterase (PDEs) retards the positive inotropic effects of \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation by decreasing levels of cAMP via degradation. Hence, PDE inhibitors sensitize the heart to catecholamine and are therefore, used as positive inotropic agents. The present study was designed to probe the potential attenuating effects of the selective PDE4 inhibitor (Roflumilast, ROF), on cardiac biomarkers, lipid profile, lipid peroxidation products, antioxidant status and histology of cardiac tissues against Cd-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were randomly distributed into four different groups: group 1, served as the normal control group. Group 2, served as the toxic control group and were administered Cd (3\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) for next 7\u202fdays. Groups 3 and 4, served as treatment groups that received Cd with concomitant oral administration of ROF doses (0.5 and 1.5\u202fmg/kg), respectively for 7\u202fdays.

Composite tubular carriers were prepared by casting film formation and crimping with the LCCs and cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) as raw materials. The structures and chemical properties of different milling time LCCs were analyzed. The carriers were used to culture human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), and the activities of these cells were examined in vitro. The FT-IR and chemical composition results showed that the biocarriers were composed of lignin moieties and polysaccharides. The SEM and inverted microscope studies revealed that a large number of cells adhered to the porous carriers. HCAEC grown on the LCC-72/CNF carriers outperformed the LCC-48/CNF and control groups in every observed category, including cell proliferation rate and metabolic activity. In summary, tubular carriers prepared from LCC/CNF composite had high biocompatibility and have potential applications in heart tissue engineering.", "journal": "International journal of biological macromolecules", "date": "2019-07-12", "authors": ["Hou-KuanZhao", "Xian-YongWei", "Yi-MinXie", "Qing-HuaFeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.07.062"}
{"title": "The effect of folic acid administration on cardiac tissue matrix metalloproteinase activity and hepatorenal biomarkers in diabetic rats ", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes severe complications. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of DM and folic acid treatment on liver and renal biomarkers, and heart remodeling through evaluation of cardiac matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. There were 4 groups: control (physiological saline 1 mL/kg, i.p., 28 days), DM (streptozotocin [STZ] 100 mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p., 1 day), folic acid (FA; 5 mg/kg, i.p., 28 days), and DM+FA (STZ 100 mg/kg, i.p., 1 day and folic acid 5 mg/kg, i.p., 28 days). Our results demonstrated increased aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity, urea and creatinine concentration, and decreased albumin and fibrinogen concentration in the DM group. MMP-2 relative activity was elevated in the DM and FA groups; MMP-9 was decreased in the DM and increased in the FA group. The folic acid treatment of diabetic rats did not change aminotransferase activity; it alleviated the increase in alkaline phosphatase and the decrease in albumin and fibrinogen concentration, and reduced MMP-2 activity; however, it increased urea and creatinine concentration. In conclusion, folic acid treatment of diabetic rats has cardio- and hepato-protective effects.

{"title": "3D Cardiac Cell Culture: A Critical Review of Current Technologies and Applications.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is often mentioned in the context of regenerative medicine, for example, for the replacement of ischemic myocardium with tissue-engineered muscle constructs. Additionally, 3D cell culture is used, although less commonly, in basic research, toxicology, and drug development. These applications have recently benefited from innovations in stem cell technologies allowing the mass-production of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes or other cardiovascular cells, and from new culturing methods including organ-on-chip and bioprinting technologies. On the analysis side, improved sensors, computer-assisted image analysis, and data collection techniques have lowered the bar for switching to 3D cell culture models.

{"title": "Nanobiomaterials: from 0D to 3D for tumor therapy and tissue regeneration.", "abstract": "Nanobiomaterials have attracted tremendous attention in the biomedical field. Especially in the past few years, a large number of low dimensional nanobiomaterials, including 0D nanostructures, 1D nanotubes and 2D nanosheets, were employed for tumor therapy due to their optically triggered tumor therapy effects and drug loading capacities. However, these low dimensional nanobiomaterials cannot support cell adhesion and possess poor tissue regeneration ability, thus they are not suitable for application in regenerative medicine. Three dimensional (3D) nanofiber scaffolds have attracted extensive attention in tissue regeneration, including bone, skin, nerve and cardiac tissues, due to their similar extracellular matrix structures. Additionally, many 3D scaffolds displayed bone and cartilage regeneration abilities. Therefore, to obtain materials with both tumor therapy and tissue regeneration abilities, it is meaningful and necessary to develop 3D nanobiomaterials with multifunctions. In this review, we systematically review the research progress of nanobiomaterials with varied dimensional structures including 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D, as well as evolutional functions from single tumor therapy to simultaneous tumor therapy and tissue regeneration. This review may pave the way for developing an interdisciplinary research of nanobiomaterials in combination of tumor therapy and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "Nanoscale", "date": "2019-07-12", "authors": ["YaqinLiu", "QingqingYu", "JiangChang", "ChengtieWu"], "doi": "10.1039/c9nr02955a"}

Furthermore, we evaluated whether the diversity of trypanosomatids changes according to bat diversity and the different levels of preservation in the region. The results showed no influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness (15 and 14 species, respectively), with similar chiropterofauna and higher abundance of two common fruit-eating bat species in the tropics: Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed by LIT/Schneider hemoculture, we detected 24 infected individuals (13%), including one positive Sturnira lilium individual that was also positive by fresh blood examination. Molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18 SSU rRNA-encoding gene fragment showed similar trypanosomatid infection rates in bats from the two areas: 15% in REGUA and 11% in EFMA (p = 0.46). Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp., in Neotropical phyllostomid bats (RNMO63 and RNMO56); mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed. The T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV are the genotypes currently involved in cases of acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. dionisii was recently found in the heart tissue of an infected child. Surprisingly, we also describe for the first time Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas.

{"title": "Combination of quercetin and Adriamycin effectively suppresses the growth of refractory acute leukemia.", "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effect of combined treatment with quercetin and Adriamycin (doxorubicin) on the development of refractory acute leukemia. Primary leukemic cells were isolated from patients with refractory drug-resistant acute leukemia. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the proliferation of cells treated with a range of doses of Adriamycin, quercetin and a combination of the two drugs. Non-irradiated mice were used to establish a T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model, which was subsequently treated with Adriamycin, quercetin and a combination of the two drugs. The survival time was recorded, and white and red blood cells and platelets in mouse peripheral blood were counted. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of cardiac tissues were measured as indicators of oxidative stress and damage. Proliferation of primary leukemic cells was reduced by Adriamycin depending on the dose (0.06, 0.6 or 6 \u00b5g/ml) and treatment duration (24, 48 or 72 h) compared with the vehicle treated group. Co-treatment with quercetin achieved a similar suppression of leukemic cell proliferation when a lower dose of Adriamycin (0.03, 0.3 or 3 \u00b5g/ml) was administered for the same duration. The survival of non-irradiated mice with T-ALL was improved by co-treatment with a high dose of Adriamycin and quercetin compared with either treatment alone. Compared with treatment with Adriamycin alone, the combined treatment with Adriamycin and quercetin significantly enhanced the SOD activity and reduced the MDA content in the heart.

{"title": "Characterization of heart macrophages in rhesus macaques as a model to study cardiovascular disease in humans.", "abstract": "Rhesus macaques are physiologically similar to humans and, thus, have served as useful animal models of human diseases including cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to characterize the distribution, composition, and phenotype of macrophages in heart tissues of very young (fetus: 0.5 years, n\u00a0=\u00a06), young adult (2-12 years, n\u00a0=\u00a012), and older adult (13-24 years, n\u00a0=\u00a09) rhesus macaques using histopathology and immunofluorescence microscopy. Results demonstrated that macrophages were uniformly distributed throughout the heart in animals of all age groups and were more prevalent than CD3-positve T-cells and CD20-positive B-cells. Macrophages comprised approximately 2% of heart tissue cells in the younger animals and increased to a mean of nearly 4% in the older adults. CD163-positive macrophages predominated over HAM56-positive and CD206-positive macrophages, and were detected at significantly higher percentage in the animals between 13 and 24 years of age, as well as in heart tissues exhibiting severe histopathology or inflammation in animals of all age groups. In vivo dextran labeling and retention indicated that approximately half of the macrophages were longer lived in healthy adult heart tissues and may comprise the tissue-resident population of macrophages.

{"title": "Correlation between frataxin expression and contractility revealed by in vitro Friedreich's ataxia cardiac tissue models engineered from human pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a non-coding mutation in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene that suppresses its expression. Compensatory hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and conduction system abnormalities in FRDA\u00a0lead to cardiomyocyte (CM) death and fibrosis, consequently resulting in heart failure and arrhythmias. Murine models have been developed to study disease pathology in the past two decades; however, differences between human and mouse physiology and metabolism have limited the relevance of animal studies in cardiac disease conditions. To bridge this gap, we aimed to generate species-specific, functional in vitro experimental models of FRDA using 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) engineered cardiac tissues from FXN-deficient human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hPSC-hvCMs) and to compare their contractile and electrophysiological properties with healthy tissue constructs.\nHealthy control and FRDA patient-specific hPSC-hvCMs were derived by directed differentiation using a small molecule-based protocol reported previously. We engineered the\u00a0hvCMs into our established human ventricular cardiac tissue strip (hvCTS) and human ventricular cardiac anisotropic sheet (hvCAS) models, and\u00a0functional assays were performed on days 7-17 post-tissue fabrication to assess the electrophysiology and contractility of FRDA patient-derived and FXN-knockdown engineered tissues, in comparison with healthy controls. To\u00a0further validate the disease model, forced expression of FXN was induced in FXN-deficient tissues to test if disease phenotypes could be rescued.\nHere, we report for the first time the generation of human engineered tissue models of FRDA cardiomyopathy from hPSCs: FXN-deficient hvCTS displayed attenuated developed forces (by 70-80%) compared to healthy controls. High-resolution optical mapping of hvCAS with reduced FXN expression also revealed electrophysiological defects consistent with clinical observations, including action potential duration prolongation and maximum capture frequency reduction.

While beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling have been demonstrated, the arrhythmogenic potential of hEHTs is a major concern. We investigated whether hiPSC-derived hEHTs increase the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. HEHTs were created from human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Left-ventricular cryo-injury was induced in guinea pigs (n\u2009=\u200937) and telemetry sensors for continuous ECG monitoring were implanted. 7 days following the cryo-injury, hEHTs or cell-free constructs were transplanted into the surviving animals (n\u2009=\u200915 and n\u2009=\u20099). ECGs were recorded over the following 28 days. 10 hEHT animals and 8 control animals survived the observation period and were included in the final analysis. After implantation of hEHTs or cell-free constructs, ventricular arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions, couplets, triplets and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) were observed in animals of both groups. The fraction of animals with the respective arrhythmias as well as the rate of arrhythmic events did not differ between groups. Following hEHT implantation, no clinically relevant sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was detected.

{"title": "Evaluation of antibodies for western blot analysis of frataxin protein isoforms.", "abstract": "Frataxin is the protein that is down-regulated in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by an intronic GAA repeat expansion in intron-1 of the FXN gene. The GAA repeats result in epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene and reduced expression of the cytosolic full-length frataxin (1-210) protein. Full length frataxin translocates to the mitochondria, leading to formation of mature frataxin (81-210) formed by cleavage of the mitochondrial targeting sequence at K-80 of the full-length protein. There are currently no approved treatments for FRDA, although experimental approaches involving up-regulation or replacement of mature frataxin protein through numerous approaches are being tested. Many of the pre-clinical studies of these experimental approaches are conducted in mouse and monkey models as well as in human cell lines. Consequently, well-validated antibodies are required for use in western blot analysis to determine whether levels of various forms of frataxin have been increased. Here we examined the specificity of five commercially available anti-frataxin antibodies and determined whether they detect mature frataxin in mouse heart tissue. Four protein standards of monkey, human, and mouse frataxin as well as mouse heart tissue were examined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in combination with western blot analysis. One antibody failed to detect any of the frataxin standards or endogenous frataxin in mouse heart tissue. Three of the antibodies detected a protein in mouse heart tissue that ran slightly faster on PAGE (at 23.4\u202fkDa) to that predicted for full-length frataxin (23.9\u202fkDa). One antibody detected all four frataxin standards as well as endogenous mouse mature frataxin in mouse tissue. Significantly, this antibody, which will be useful for monitoring mature frataxin levels in monkey, human, and mouse tissues, did not detect a protein in mouse heart tissue at 23.4\u202fkDa. Therefore, antibodies detecting the immunoreactive protein at 23.4\u202fkDa could be misleading when testing for the up-regulation of frataxin in animal models.", "journal": "Journal of immunological methods", "date": "2019-07-08", "authors": ["LiweiWeng", "QingqingWang", "SixiangYu", "XiaoluYang", "David RLynch", "ClementinaMesaros", "Ian ABlair"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jim.2019.07.001"}

Three different lines (L5, L7, and L8) of iCOX-2 TG mice were studied; in all three lines, infarct size was markedly reduced compared with WT mice: L5 TG/TG 23.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 vs. WT/WT 48.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1% of risk region; L7 TG/TG 23.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2 vs. WT/WT 53.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6%; and L8 TG/TG 23.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 vs. WT/WT 52.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6% (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for each). COX-2 inhibition with NS-398 completely abolished the cardioprotection provided by COX-2 overexpression. This study for the first time utilizes an inducible cardiac-specific COX-2 overexpression system to examine the role of this enzyme in ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. We demonstrate that induced cardiac-specific overexpression of COX-2 exerts a potent cardioprotective effect against myocardial infarction in mice, and that chronic COX-2 overexpression is not associated with any apparent deleterious effects. We also show that PGE2 levels are upregulated in COX-2 overexpressing cardiac tissue, confirming increased enzyme activity. Finally, we have developed a valuable genetic tool to further our understanding of the role of COX-2 in ischemia/reperfusion injury and other settings. The concept that COX-2 is chronically protective has important therapeutic implications for studies of long-term gene therapy aimed at increasing myocardial COX-2 content as well as other COX-2- based strategies.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2019-07-07", "authors": ["YiruGuo", "YibingNong", "Deepali NivasTukaye", "GreggRokosh", "JunjieDu", "XiaopingZhu", "MichaelBook", "AlexTomlin", "QianhongLi", "RobertoBolli"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-019-0741-2\n10.1136/hrt.2003.010280\n10.1016/S0735-1097(87)80206-1\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00414-5\n10.1007/s00395-018-0696-8\n10.1161/01.RES.0000218454.76784.66\n10.1016/0090-6980(94)90074-4\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00505-3\n10.1007/s003950070024\n10.1007/s00395-012-0288-y\n10.1073/pnas.96.20.11507\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041178\n10.1007/s10557-010-6237-9\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.11.011\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305462\n10.1007/s00395-011-0180-1\n10.1007/s00395-011-0208-6\n10.1007/s00395-011-0207-7\n10.1161/01.RES.0000065441.72685.29\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.279.4.H1679\n10.1172/JCI116608\n10.1152/ajpheart.00335.2017\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00087-1\n10.1161/01.RES.0000065442.64694.9F\n10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00086-X\n10.1073/pnas.97.18.10197\n10.1016/S0304-3940(01)02449-1\n10.1161/01.RES.79.3.424\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.2.100\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.2.95\n10.1016/S0022-2828(03)00076-2"}

In cultured cardiomyocytes, high-concentration glucose induced EGFR-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation.

The onset of this instability, which is linked to period-doubling bifurcation and may be a route to chaos, is of particular interest. Mechano-electric feedback depicts the effects of tissue deformation on cardiac excitation. The main effect of mechano-electric feedback is delivered via the so-called stretch-activated ion channels and is caused by stretch-activated currents. Mechano-electric feedback, which is believed to have proarrhythmic and antiarrhythmic effects on cardiac electrophysiology, affects the action potential duration in a manner dependent on cycle length, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be elucidated. In this study, a biophysically detailed electromechanical model of cardiac tissue is employed to show how a stretch-activated current can affect the action potential duration at cellular and tissue levels, illustrating its effects on the onset of alternans. Also, using a two-dimensional iterated map that incorporates stretch-activated current effects, we apply linear stability analysis to study the stability of the bifurcation.

Following identification of deceased ACM probands possessing ANK2 rare variants and evidence of ankyrin-B loss of function on cardiac tissue analysis, an ANK2 mouse model was found to develop dramatic structural abnormalities reflective of human ACM, including biventricular dilation, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac fibrosis, and premature death.

{"title": "The role of microRNAs in congenital heart disease.", "abstract": "Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the leading inherited cause of perinatal and infant mortality. CHD refers to structural anomalies of the heart and blood vessels that arise during cardiac development and represents a broad spectrum of malformations, including septal and valve defects, lesions affecting the outflow tract and ventricules. Advanced treatment strategies have greatly improved life expectancy and led to expanded population of adult patients with CHD. Thus, a better understanding of the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms underlying CHDs is essential to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients. The etiology of CHD is largely unknown, genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the disease. In addition to the mutations affecting genomic DNA, epigenetic changes are being increasingly acknowledged as key factors in the development and progression of CHDs. The posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRs) controls the highly complex multi-cell lineage process of cardiac tissue formation. In recent years, multiplex experimental models have provided evidence that changes in expression levels of miRs are associated with human cardiovascular disease, including CHD. The newly described correlations between miRs and heart development suggest the potential importance of miRs as diagnostic markers in human cardiovascular diseases. In the future, more intensive research is likely to be carried out to clarify their contribution to personalized management and treatment of CHD patients.

LCZ696 is the first angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) to be used clinically. Our study investigated the role played by LCZ696 during diabetic cardiomyopathy and explored the potential mechanisms underlying these effects. Diabetes was induced by injecting streptozotocin intraperitoneally into mice, and the mice were then divided randomly into two groups: one group was treated with LCZ696 (60 mg/kg/d) for 16 weeks, and the other received no treatment. The H9C2 cardiomyoblast cell line was treated with LCZ696 under high-glucose (HG) conditions. The levels of apoptotic (Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3) and pro-inflammatory factors [nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK)] were assessed in heart tissues from diabetic and normal mice and in H9C2 cells. The heart tissue structures and cardiac functions of diabetic mice were compared with those of normal mice, using histological and echocardiographic analyses. The results showed that LCZ696 inhibits the nuclear transfer of NF-\u03baB and JNK/p38MAPK phosphorylation, and mitigates inflammation and apoptosis in diabetic mice and H9C2 cardiomyocytes under HG conditions. The histological and echocardiographic data showed that compared with untreated diabetic mice, diabetic mice treated with LCZ696 exhibited improved ventricular remodeling and cardiac function. LCZ696 also ameliorated oxidative stress in both vivo and vitro. In conclusion, LCZ696 improved diabetic cardiomyopathy by reducing cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.\nDiabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure in patients with diabetes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.

Although generally safe, it is not completely exempt from the risk of complications. The great flexibility of computational models can be a major asset in optimizing interventional strategies if they can produce sufficiently precise estimations of the generated lesion for a given ablation protocol. This requires an accurate description of the catheter tip and the cardiac tissue. In particular, the deformation of the tissue under the catheter pressure during the ablation is an important aspect that is overlooked in the existing literature, which resorts to a sharp insertion of the catheter into an undeformed geometry. As the lesion size depends on the power dissipated in the tissue and the latter depends on the percentage of the electrode surface in contact with the tissue itself, the sharp insertion geometry has the tendency to overestimate the lesion obtained, which is a consequence of the tissue temperature rise overestimation. In this paper, we introduce a full 3D computational model that takes into account the tissue elasticity and is able to capture tissue deformation and realistic power dissipation in the tissue.

Results showed that high-fat diet caused glucose dysmetabolism, elevated plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), corticosterone, malondialdehyde (MDA), plasma and cardiac UA, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). High-fat diet also led to depressed reduced glutathione (GSH). Histological analysis of cardiac tissue showed cellular infarction, infiltration, and fibrosis in high-fat diet-fed rats. However, all these effects were ameliorated by BUT treatment. The findings here showed that high-fat diet resulted in glucose dysmetabolism and cardiac tissue damage through a UA-dependent mechanism and that BUT can protect against high-fat diet-induced cardiometabolic disorders through UA suppression and augmentation of glutathione antioxidant defenses.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2019-07-01", "authors": ["CarolineBadejogbin", "Damilare EAreola", "Kehinde SOlaniyi", "Oluwaseun AAdeyanju", "Isaac OAdeosun"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-019-01679-2"}
{"title": "Wisteria floribunda agglutinin staining for the quantitative assessment of cardiac fibrogenic activity in a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a typical phenomenon in failing hearts for most cardiac diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and its specific detection and quantification are crucial for the analysis of cardiac remodeling. Since cardiac fibrosis is characterized by extensive remodeling of the myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM), in which glycoproteins are the major components, we assumed that fibrosis-related alterations in the cardiac glycome and glycoproteome would be suitable targets for the detection of cardiac fibrosis. Here, we compared protein glycosylation between heart tissues of normal and DCM model mice by laser microdissection-assisted lectin microarray. Among 45 lectins, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) was selected as the most suitable lectin for staining cardiac fibrotic tissues. Although the extent of WFA staining was highly correlated (r\u2009>\u20090.98) with that of picrosirius red staining, a common collagen staining method, WFA did not bind to collagen fibers. Further histochemical analysis with N-glycosidase revealed that WFA staining of fibrotic tissues was attributable to the binding of WFA to N-glycoproteins. Using a mass spectrometry-based approach, we identified WFA-binding N-glycoproteins expressed in DCM hearts, many of which were fibrogenesis-related ECM proteins, as expected. In addition, the identified glycoproteins carrying WFA-binding N-glycans were detected only in DCM hearts, suggesting their cooperative glycosylation alterations with disease progression. Among these WFA-binding ECM N-glycoproteins, co-localization of the collagen \u03b16(VI) chain protein and WFA staining in cardiac tissue sections was confirmed with a double-staining analysis. Collectively, these results indicate that WFA staining is more suitable for the quantitative assessment of cardiac fibrogenic activity than current collagen staining methods. Furthermore, given that plasma WFA-binding glycoprotein levels were significantly correlated with the echocardiographic parameters for left ventricular remodeling, cardiac WFA-binding glycoproteins are candidate\u00a0circulating glyco-biomarkers for the quantification and monitoring of cardiac fibrogenesis.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2019-06-30", "authors": ["ChiakiNagai-Okatani", "MitsuhiroNishigori", "TakashiSato", "NaotoMinamino", "HiroyukiKaji", "AtsushiKuno"], "doi": "10.1038/s41374-019-0279-9"}

The possibility of noninvasive optical monitoring of cardiac hemodynamics was theoretically investigated in this study. By utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation method for voxelized media (MCVM) and Visible Chinese Human dataset, we quantified and visualized the photon migration in human thoracic region. The light fluence distribution was showed to reach heart tissue (\u223c3 cm depth underbody surface) and 12% of the total fluence was absorbed by the myocardium. The proportion of spatial sensitivity distribution (SSD) in cardiac tissue to the total SSD reached 0.0195%. The portion of SSD increased following with cardiac diastole and diffuse reflectance deceased linearly with increasing cardiac volume. The optimal separation between the light source and detector was provided to be 3.5 to 4.0 cm for future development of noninvasive cardiac hemodynamics monitoring. A pilot experimental study was conducted to measure the diffuse reflectance light and fingertip photoplethysmography. These data suggest that the fluctuation period of near-infrared (NIR) diffuse reflectance was consistent with the cardiac cycle, while the fluctuation features of the NIR signal was not consistent with that of photoplethysmography.

The levels of myocardial enzymes were measured using commercial kits, and an echocardiography system was utilized for the detection of cardiac function parameters. The pathological features and infarction sizes of cardiac tissues were examined using H&E, TCC and Masson's trichrome staining, and the amount of cell apoptosis was determined using an in situ TUNEL assay. Cardiomyocytes were isolated and then subjected to hypoxia induction in vitro. The expression of the RIPK1, RIPK3 and phosphorylated MLKL (p-MLKL) proteins was measured using a Western blot. The mouse cardiomyocyte cell viability was analyzed by an MTT assay. The mRNA target of miR-325-3p was predicted using TargetScan v7.2 and then validated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The overexpression of miR-325-3p evidently decreased the expression levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphocreatine kinase (CK), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), inhibited left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), and promoted left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVES).

{"title": "Unveiling the Interplay between the TLR4/MD2 Complex and HSP70 in the Human Cardiovascular System: A Computational Approach.", "abstract": "While precise mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are still not fully understood, previous studies suggest that the innate immune system, through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), plays a crucial part in the pathways leading to these diseases, mainly because of its interplay with endogenous molecules. The Heat-shock protein 70 family (HSP70-70kDa) is of particular interest in cardiovascular tissues as it may have dual effects when interacting with TLR4 pathways. Although the hypothesis of the HSP70 family members acting as TLR4 ligands is becoming widely accepted, to date no co-crystal structure of this complex is available and it is still unknown whether this process requires the co-adaptor MD2. In this study, we aimed at investigating the interplay between the TLR4/MD2 complex and HSP70 family members in the human cardiovascular system through transcriptomic data analysis and at proposing a putative interaction model between these proteins. We report compelling evidence of correlated expression levels between TLR4 and MD2 with HSP70 cognate family members, especially in heart tissue. In our molecular docking simulations, we found that HSP70 in the ATP-bound state presents a better docking score towards the TLR4/MD2 complex compared to the ADP-bound state (-22.60 vs. -10.29 kcal/mol, respectively). Additionally, we show via a proximity ligation assay for HSP70 and TLR4, that cells stimulated with ATP have higher formation of fluorescent spots and that MD2 might be required for the complexation of these proteins.

{"title": "Cardiac troponin I is present in plasma of type 1 myocardial infarction patients and patients with troponin I elevations due to other etiologies as complex with little free I.", "abstract": "Cardiac troponin (cTn) is a complex of three subunits (T, I, and C), with some studies reporting that ~5-10% is cytosolic and unbound ('free'). It has been hypothesized that free cTn is released before complex and before or without cell death dependent on the severity of ischemia. In this context, new generation assays that can discriminate free, binary (IC) and ternary (TIC) complex forms may aid to differentiate between type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) and cTn elevations due to different etiologies, e.g. demand ischemia and type 2 MI.\nSerial plasma samples from six type 1 MI patients and twenty-seven patients with other cTnI elevations, e.g. due to demand ischemia and type 2 MI, were analyzed using high-sensitivity ET Healthcare Pylon assays for total cTnI, complex cTnI (IC and TIC), and cTnTIC. The specificity of the anti-cTnT antibody in the cTnTIC assay was such that only full-size cTnTIC is detected. In vitro stability of different cTnI forms was assessed by spiking free cTnI and cTnTIC in cTnI-free serum, incubating at 4 or 37\u202f\u00b0C, and measuring different cTnI forms over 0-182\u202fh. Presence of cytosolic free cTnI was evaluated on fixed rat cardiac tissue using an antibody against free cTnI.\nPylon assays for total and complex cTnI tracked well over time with each other and gave similar results, both for type 1 MI and non-type 1 MI patients, indicating that the vast majority was complex cTnI. As a minority of complex cTnI was full-size cTnTIC, this indicated that complex cTnI mainly consisted of a degraded form of cTnTIC (low-molecular weight cTnTIC) and/or cTnIC. Full-size cTnTIC was more abundant in early compared to late samples. In vitro studies indicated that free cTnI and cTnTIC are not stable at 37\u202f\u00b0C (28% and 11% recovery after 24\u202fh, respectively) and this is also true to some extent for cTnTIC at 4\u202f\u00b0C (60% recovery after 24\u202fh). Free cTnI was not readily detected in rat cardiac tissue.\nIn agreement with type 1 MI, cTnI in samples of patients with cTnI elevations due to other etiologies is found predominantly as complex cTnI, of which some is full-size cTnTIC. In most cases, assays for total and complex cTnI indicated there was little free cTnI; however, its presence cannot be completely excluded, due to the inability of its direct measurement and limited stability.", "journal": "Clinical biochemistry", "date": "2019-06-28", "authors": ["Xander M Rvan Wijk", "StijnClaassen", "Nicholas SEnea", "PuLi", "SamuelYang", "Marc ABrouwer", "G EtienneCramer", "RobertZuk", "Kara LLynch", "Alan H BWu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2019.06.012"}
{"title": "Mouse HSA+ immature cardiomyocytes persist in the adult heart and expand after ischemic injury.", "abstract": "The assessment of the regenerative capacity of the heart has been compromised by the lack of surface signatures to characterize cardiomyocytes (CMs). Here, combined multiparametric surface marker analysis with single-cell transcriptional profiling and in vivo transplantation identify the main mouse fetal cardiac populations and their progenitors (PRGs). We found that CMs at different stages of differentiation coexist during development. We identified a population of immature heat stable antigen (HSA)/ cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24)+ CMs that persists throughout life and that, unlike other CM subsets, actively proliferates up to 1 week of age and engrafts cardiac tissue upon transplantation. In the adult heart, a discrete population of HSA/CD24+ CMs appears as mononucleated cells that increase in frequency after infarction. Our work identified cell surface signatures that allow the prospective isolation of CMs at all developmental stages and the detection of a subset of immature CMs throughout life that, although at reduced frequencies, are poised for activation in response to ischemic stimuli.

{"title": "Platelet Contributions to Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.", "abstract": "Obstruction of a coronary artery causes ischemia of heart tissue leading to myocardial infarction. Prolonged oxygen deficiency provokes tissue necrosis, which can result in heart failure and death of the patient. Therefore, restoration of coronary blood flow (reperfusion of the ischemic area) by re-canalizing the affected vessel is essential for a better patient outcome. Paradoxically, sudden reperfusion also causes tissue injury, thereby increasing the initial ischemic damage despite restoration of blood flow (=ischemia/reperfusion injury, IRI). Myocardial IRI is a complex event that involves various harmful mechanisms (e.g., production of reactive oxygen species and local increase in calcium ions) as well as inflammatory cells and signals like chemokines and cytokines. An involvement of platelets in the inflammatory reaction associated with IRI was discovered several years ago, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. This mini review focusses on platelet contributions to the intricate picture of myocardial IRI. We summarize how upregulation of platelet surface receptors and release of immunomodulatory mediators lead to aggravation of myocardial IRI and subsequent cardiac damage by different mechanisms such as recruitment and activation of immune cells or modification of the cardiac vascular endothelium. In addition, evidence for cardioprotective roles of distinct platelet factors during IRI will be discussed.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2019-06-28", "authors": ["NancySchanze", "ChristophBode", "DanielDuerschmied"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2019.01260\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.036\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.814640\n10.4103/tcmj.tcmj_33_18\n10.1152/physiol.00030.2017\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.01.010\n10.1093/cvr/cvy286\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.01.022\n10.1111/eci.12633\n10.1038/nrcardio.2014.28\n10.1016/j.blre.2014.10.003\n10.1160/TH14-02-0146\n10.1182/blood-2008-01-078204\n10.1016/j.blre.2006.06.001\n10.1083/jcb.118.2.445\n10.1161/01.RES.0000267878.97021.ab\n10.1172/JCI110973\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81607-4\n10.1172/JCI110808\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2008.00410.x\n10.1073/pnas.76.8.4107\n10.1164/rccm.201103-0516OC\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2010.03.009\n10.1182/blood-2004-06-2475\n10.1161/01.CIR.103.13.1772\n10.1182/blood-2012-06-437392\n10.1084/jem.20041497\n10.1152/ajpcell.00060.2012\n10.1152/ajpheart.00634.2005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.033942\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.09.018\n10.1073/pnas.1505887112\n10.1189/jlb.72.3.455\n10.1177/1074248412467692\n10.3324/haematol.10741\n10.1159/000086192\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.528133\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2017.07.039\n10.1097/00005344-199406000-00010\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.09.068\n10.1006/jsre.1993.1176\n10.1007/s00395-005-0540-9\n10.1152/ajpheart.00599.2004\n10.1160/TH09-07-0440\n10.3109/09537104.2012.658107\n10.1160/TH09-12-0823\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.07.006\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.305873\n10.1055/s-0037-1613242\n10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00350-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.11.1085\n10.1016/S0024-3205(02)02021-0\n10.1016/j.amjms.2016.05.034\n10.1152/ajpheart.00065.2002\n10.1172/JCI116501\n10.2165/00003495-200161030-00006\n10.1007/s11010-009-0337-5\n10.1161/01.RES.0000094746.24774.DC\n10.1023/A:1008986329267\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2014.12.023\n10.3390/antiox7010014\n10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00414-7\n10.1258/ebm.2011.010316\n10.1093/cvr/cvy314\n10.1152/physrev.2000.80.4.1669\n10.1016/S0008-6363(01)00420-5\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0705590\n10.1007/s003920070038\n10.1126/science.1256478\n10.1159/000074890\n10.1152/ajpheart.00134.2018\n10.1055/s-0037-1603928\n10.1007/s00395-017-0662-x\n10.1007/s00395-018-0670-5:"}

To compare the outcomes of three methods, morphologic examination, immunofluorescent stainings and live/dead cell assay were performed and the effects of serum concentration and ascorbic acid treatment on cardiac gene expressions were examined. The results showed that cardiomyoblast sheets were successfully obtained in all approaches without losing their integrity and viability.

{"title": "Subchronic exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles modifies cardiac structure and performance in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases, intended as the results of a combination of inherited, environmental and biological factors, kill 40 million people each year, equivalent to roughly 70% of all premature deaths globally. The possibility that manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) may affect cardiac performance, has led to recognize NPs-exposure not only as a major Public Health concern, but also as an occupational hazard. In volunteers, NPs-exposure is problematic to quantify. We recently found that inhaled titanium dioxide NPs, one of the most produced engineered nanomaterials, acutely increased cardiac excitability and promoted arrhythmogenesis in normotensive rats by a direct interaction with cardiac cells. We hypothesized that such scenario can be exacerbated by latent cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension.\nWe monitored cardiac electromechanical performance in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exposed to titanium dioxide NPs for 6\u2009weeks using a combination of cardiac functional measurements associated with toxicological, immunological, physical and genetic assays. Longitudinal radio-telemetry ECG recordings and multiple-lead epicardial potential mapping revealed that atrial activation times significantly increased as well as proneness to arrhythmia. At the third week of nanoparticles administration, the lung and cardiac tissue encountered a maladaptive irreversible structural remodelling starting with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and lipid peroxidation, resulting in upregulation of the main pro-fibrotic cardiac genes. At the end of the exposure, the majority of spontaneous arrhythmic events terminated, while cardiac hemodynamic deteriorated and a significant accumulation of fibrotic tissue occurred as compared to control untreated SHRs. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles were quantified in the heart tissue although without definite accumulation as revealed by particle-induced X-ray emission and ultrastructural analysis.\nThe co-morbidity of hypertension and inhaled nanoparticles induces irreversible hemodynamic impairment associated with cardiac structural damage potentially leading to heart failure. The time-dependence of exposure indicates a non-return point that needs to be taken into account in hypertensive subjects daily exposed to nanoparticles.", "journal": "Particle and fibre toxicology", "date": "2019-06-27", "authors": ["StefanoRossi", "MoniaSavi", "MartaMazzola", "SilvanaPinelli", "RossellaAlinovi", "LauraGennaccaro", "AlessandraPagliaro", "VivianaMeraviglia", "MariclaGaletti", "OmarLozano-Garcia", "AlessandraRossini", "CaterinaFrati", "AngelaFalco", "FedericoQuaini", "LeonardoBocchi", "DonatellaStilli", "St\u00e9phaneLucas", "MatteoGoldoni", "EmilioMacchi", "AntonioMutti", "MicheleMiragoli"], "doi": "10.1186/s12989-019-0311-7\n10.5588/pha.15.0030\n10.1186/1743-8977-5-17\n10.1289/ehp.9469\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aan6205\n10.12688/f1000research.7108.1\n10.1186/s12989-017-0226-0\n10.1006/taap.2000.8899\n10.3109/08958378.2013.850127\n10.1093/toxsci/71.2.237\n10.1289/ehp.1002508\n10.1016/j.tox.2017.04.010\n10.1016/j.fct.2013.04.050\n10.1016/S0828-282X(06)70275-6\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018912\n10.1186/1743-8977-10-15\n10.1097/JOM.0b013e3182611a49\n10.1016/j.tox.2006.11.002\n10.1186/s12989-014-0063-3\n10.2217/nnm.12.125\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2007.05.007\n10.1093/toxsci/54.2.441\n10.1007/s11356-019-04874-z\n10.1021/acsnano.6b08551\n10.1289/ehp.01109s4547\n10.1152/ajpheart.00235.2014\n10.3109/17435390.2014.996192\n10.3390/molecules23081955\n10.3109/17435390.2014.984251\n10.1186/s11671-015-1029-6\n10.3109/17435390.2013.796536\n10.1161/01.RES.0000214537.44195.a3\n10.1152/ajpheart.01146.2005\n10.1007/s11897-017-0343-y\n10.1289/ehp.02110749\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09045\n10.1186/1755-1536-5-15\n10.1016/j.tiv.2014.12.007\n10.1080/17435390.2017.1306894\n10.3390/ijms18122757\n10.1539/joh.16-0094-OA\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112697\n10.1016/S0031-9384(96)00228-4\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043\n10.1016/0002-9149(69)90006-X\n10.1113/expphysiol.2005.032607\n10.1152/ajpheart.00517.2008\n10.1016/j.taap.2012.08.004\n10.3109/17435390.2011.572301\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262"}

In addition, we compared the gene data from the cardiac tissue with the same gene profile in blood as well as circulating cytokines to elucidate possible targets in blood that could be used to estimate the inflammatory state of the heart in cardiac disease.\nWe found a marked upregulation of TLR-induced inflammation in cardiac tissue from both patient groups compared to healthy controls. The inflammation appeared to be primarily mediated through TLR1, 3, 7, 8 and 10, resulting in a marked induction of mediators of the innate immune response. Furthermore, the gene expression data in combination with unbiased multivariate analysis suggested a difference in inflammatory response in ischemic cardiac tissue compared to non-ischemic cardiac tissue.

Here, we report a comprehensive phenotyping of a lamp2 knockout (KO) mutant. LAMP2 encodes a lysosomal protein and is a causative gene of Danon disease that is characterized by HCM and massive autophagic vacuoles accumulation in the tissues. There is no effective therapy yet to treat this most lethal cardiomyopathy in the young. First, we did find the autophagic vacuoles accumulation in cardiac tissues from lamp2 KO. Next, through employing a set of emerging phenotyping tools, we revealed heart failure phenotypes in the lamp2 KO mutants, including decreased ventricular ejection fraction, reduced physical exercise capacity, blunted \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response, and enlarged atrium. We also noted changes of the following indices suggesting cardiac hypertrophic remodeling in lamp2 KO: a rounded heart shape, increased end-systolic ventricular volume and density of ventricular myocardium, elevated actomyosin activation kinetics together with increased maximal isometric tension at the level of cardiac myofibrils. Lastly, we assessed the function of lysosomal-localized mTOR on the lamp2-associated Danon disease. We found that haploinsufficiency of mtor was able to normalize some characteristics of the lamp2 KO, including ejection fraction, \u03b2-adrenergic response, and the actomyosin activation kinetics.

Meanwhile, AngII could inhibit the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in macrophages, which are engaged in ECM degradation and cardiac remodeling.

We investigated whether nitrite improves the cardiac function in normotensive and in hypertensive rats. Two-kidney, one-clip hypertension model (2K1C) was induced in Wistar rats. Blood pressure was evaluated by tail-cuff plethysmography over 6\u202fweeks. By the end of week 2, hypertensive and normotensive rats received nitrite (daily dose of 1 or 15\u202fmg/kg) by gavage for 4\u202fweeks. Cardiac morphology and function were performed by transthoracic echocardiography. Intrinsic heart function was evaluated using the isolated heart model (Langendorff's preparation).

Nitrite treatment (15\u202fmg/kg) lowered both systolic blood pressure and the increases in left ventricular (LV) mass found in 2K1C rats (P\u202f<\u202f.05). In addition, nitrite treatment restored the decreased cardiac output in 2K1C rats (P\u202f<\u202f.05) and improved the cardiac function. These findings were associated with increased nitrite, S-nitrosothiols, and protein S-nitrosylation (all P\u202f<\u202f.05) assessed in heart tissue. The cardiac effects of nitrite were further investigated in the isolated heart model, and nitrite infusion (1\u202f\u03bcmol/L) enhanced cardiac contractility and relaxation. This infusion increased S-nitrosothiols concentrations and protein S-nitrosylation in the heart. Ascorbate completely blunted all nitrite-induced effects. These findings show that treatment with oral nitrite improves cardiac function by mechanisms involving increased S-nitrosothiols generation and S-nitrosylation of cardiac proteins.

The common underlying theme in these approaches is to combine together matrix material and different cell types to make something similar to heart tissue. Multi-cellularity is an essential aspect of the heart and therefore critical to any approach which would try to mimic such a complex tissue.

Histological analysis revealed that meflin-positive fibroblastic cells and their lineage cells proliferated in the hearts after acute myocardial infarction and pressure-overload heart failure mouse models. Analysis of meflin knockout mice revealed that meflin is essential for the increase in the number of cells that highly express type I collagen in the heart walls after myocardial infarction induction. When subjected to pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction, meflin knockout mice developed marked cardiac interstitial fibrosis with defective compensation mechanisms. Analysis with atomic force microscopy and hemodynamic catheterization revealed that meflin knockout mice developed stiff failing hearts with diastolic dysfunction.

However, current clinical approaches still do not encompass a thorough therapeutic solution for improving heart function of the patients who suffered an extensive myocardial injury. Based on this status quo, stem cells could become a novel option, as a natural source of the new myocardium lineage cells, being capable of paracrine factors secretion, protection or even regeneration of the damaged heart muscle. Efficient stem cell-based therapy of the heart should lead to repair or/and replacement of the degenerated tissue with functional myocardial and endothelial cells. Hereon, various types of pluripotent and multipotent stem cells have been already studied in the pre-clinical and clinical settings, demonstrating their cardiomyogenic and regenerative potential. In this context, as a type of male adult stem/ progenitors, spermatogonial stem cells feature a remarkable ability for a formation of cardiovascular lineages, based on our own observations. Presented data supports the presumption, that spermatogonial stem cells not only have a suitable capacity to generate functional heart cells but can also potentially improve the function of an injured myocardium. In this review article, we first describe the essential molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the heart tissue injury.

{"title": "Mesenchymal stem cells rejuvenate cardiac muscle through regulating macrophage polarization.", "abstract": "We have shown that the effects of transplantation of CD146+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on myocardial regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI) exceeds the effects of transplantation of MSCs, likely resulting from reduction of aging-associated cellular reactive oxygen species in injured cardiac muscle cells (CMCs). Since the role of macrophages in the MSC-mediated recovery of heart function after MI remains unclear, this question was thus addressed in the current study. We found that transplantation of MSCs did not alter the total number of the macrophages in the injured heart, but induced their polarization towards a M2-phenotype. Moreover, administration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) into MSC-transplanted mice, which prevented M2-polarization of macrophages, abolished the effects of MSCs on recovery of heart function and on the reduction of infarcted cardiac tissue. Thus, our data suggest that MSCs may rejuvenate CMCs after ischemic injury at least partially through induction of M2-polarization of macrophages.", "journal": "Aging", "date": "2019-06-19", "authors": ["BushengZhang", "NaishiZhao", "JingZhang", "YuLiu", "DanZhu", "YeKong"], "doi": "10.18632/aging.102009\n10.1196/annals.1299.126\n10.18632/oncotarget.14890\n10.1111/cpr.12316\n10.1038/srep31528\n10.1038/srep28250\n10.1038/srep19155\n10.1016/j.tcm.2016.02.001\n10.1016/j.healun.2014.02.029\n10.1038/srep41756\n10.7150/thno.22788\n10.18632/oncotarget.17012\n10.18632/oncotarget.16778\n10.18632/oncotarget.15245\n10.1080/14653240600855905\n10.1073/pnas.1710848114\n10.18632/aging.101718\n10.1002/sctm.18-0105\n10.1016/j.lfs.2018.09.052\n10.3892/mmr.2018.8457\n10.1038/nri2808\n10.1038/nri1733\n10.1038/nri2528\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.036\n10.2217/rme-2016-0086\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016789\n10.1093/cvr/cvr328\n10.1038/nm.1905\n10.1002/stem.1047\n10.1371/journal.pone.0129164\n10.5966/sctm.2015-0020\n10.1002/stem.503\n10.1371/journal.ppat.1003454\n10.1160/TH14-06-0509"}

This study aims to provide some references for the prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced myocardial injury.\nAccording to the random number table, 60 male C57 mice were divided into the Sham group (n=20), LPS group (n=20) and LPS + NEAT1 small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) group (n=20). Sepsis-induced myocardial injury model in mice was established by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg), and the NEAT1 knockout model was established by tail vein injection of NEAT1 siRNAs. After 12 h, the cardiac function of mice in each group was detected via the two-dimensional ultrasound; ejection fraction [EF (%)] and fraction shortening [FS (%)] were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was conducted to evaluate the pathological changes in the heart tissues in each group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to detect the apoptotic levels of myocardial cells and fibroblasts in each group. In addition, the expression level of the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonena (4-HNE) and the positive proportions of cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45) and CD68 in the mouse heart of three groups were detected via immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory indicators [interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)] in mouse serum of the three groups were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the effects of NEAT1 siRNAs on the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway were detected by Western blotting.\nENEAT1 knockdown could significantly improve ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiac insufficiency in rats, and increase EF (%) and FS (%) (p<0.05). Besides, NEAT1 knockdown remarkably inhibited the LPS-induced myocardial injury. Compared with the LPS group, LPS + NEAT 1 siRNA group has more orderly arranged cardiac myofilament, a lower degree of degradation and necrosis, and significantly reduced cell edema. TUNEL staining showed that NEAT1 knockdown markedly reduced LPS-induced apoptosis of cardiac cells (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical results revealed that NEAT1 knockdown could remarkably reverse LPS-induced elevation of the myocardial 4-HNE expression and decrease the oxidative stress in the heart (p<0.05). At the same time, CD45+ and CD68+ cells were reduced after NEAT1 knockdown in myocardial tissues (p<0.05). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the mRNA levels of inflammatory indicators in LPS + NEAT1 siRNA group were lower than that in the LPS group (p<0.05). According to Western blotting results, NEAT1 siRNAs could significantly downregulate the protein expressions of TLR2 and p-p65.\nNEAT1 knockdown can improve LPS-induced myocardial injury in mice by inhibiting the TLR2/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

We used HPASubC, a suite of Python tools, to rapidly review and classify each image for a specific t-tubule staining pattern. The tools Gene Cards, String 11, and Gene Ontology Consortium as well as literature searches were used to understand pathways and relationships between the proteins.\nThere were 96 likely t-tubule proteins identified by HPASubC. Of these, 12 were matrisome proteins and 3 were mitochondrial proteins. A separate literature search identified 50 known t-tubule proteins. A comparison of the 2 lists revealed only 17 proteins in common, including 8 of the matrisome proteins. String11 revealed that 94 of 127 combined t-tubule proteins generated a single interconnected network.\nUsing HPASubC and the HPA, we identified 78 novel, putative t-tubule proteins and validated 17 within the literature.

However, inefficient incorporation, retention, and activity of MSCs in cardiac tissue remain an obstacle. Since surges in follicular estradiol (E2; \u03bcmolar-range) trigger tissue remodeling (e.g. ovulation) and E2 exerts beneficial actions on the cardiovascular system, we hypothesized that E2 may promote/improve MSC-mediated cardiac repair processes. Using Wharton's jelly (WJ)-derived MSCs we assessed the effects of E2 on MSC proliferation, directed migration, and engraftment in murine heart slices (using xCELLigence real-time cell-impedance system, DNA quantification, and microscopy) and on MSC-induced angiogenesis in vivo (matrigel plug assay). Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting, ELISA/Luminex, and proteomic analysis; whereas mRNA expression was assessed by qRT-PCR. MSCs expressed estrogen receptors (ERs) -alpha and -beta. E2 promoted MSC proliferation and up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of ER-alpha, ER-beta, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -9, yet down-regulated MMP-2 expression. Moreover, E2 up-regulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGFR-2, vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1), and angiogenin (ANG) and stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production via ER. Proteomic analysis of MSCs showed that E2 up-regulated 47 proteins, down-regulated 7 proteins, and increased the expression of key biochemical components/pathways involved in tissue repair. In MSCs co-cultured with murine heart-slices, E2 significantly induced MSC migration in an ER-alpha-dependent fashion and significantly increased the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9, ANG, and VEGF. In an in vivo matrigel assay, E2-treated MSCs increased angiogenesis and hemoglobin content. In conclusion, E2-treatment increases the incorporation of MSCs in heart slices and promotes MSC-induced angiogenesis. These beneficial effects are mediated via increases in molecules/pathways involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis.

{"title": "Dynamics of Pivoting Electrical Waves in a Cardiac Tissue Model.", "abstract": "Through a detailed mathematical analysis we seek to advance our understanding of how cardiac tissue conductances govern pivoting (spiral, scroll, rotor, functional reentry) wave dynamics. This is an important problem in cardiology since pivoting waves likely underlie most reentrant tachycardias. The problem is complex, and to advance our methods of analysis we introduce two new tools: a ray tracing method and a moving-interface model. When used in combination with an ionic model, they permit us to elucidate the role played by tissue conductances on pivoting wave dynamics. Specifically we simulate traveling electrical waves with an ionic model that can reproduce the characteristics of plane and pivoting waves in small patches of cardiac tissue. Then ray tracing is applied to the simulated pivoting waves in a manner to expose their real displacement. In this exercise we find loci with special characteristics, as well as zones where a part of a pivoting wave quickly transitions from a regenerative to a non-regenerative propagation mode. The loci themselves and the monitoring of the ionic model state variables in this zone permit to elucidate several aspects of pivoting wave dynamics. We then formulate the moving-interface model based on the information gathered with the above-mentioned analysis. Equipped with a velocity profile v(s), s: distance along of the pivoting wave contour and the steady- state action potential duration (APD) of a plane wave during entrainment, APDss(T), at period T, this simple model can predict: shape, orbit of revolution, rotation period, whether a pivoting wave will break up or not, and whether the tissue will admit pivoting waves or not. Because v(s) and APDss(T) are linked to the ionic model, dynamical analysis with the moving-interface model conveys information on the role played by tissue conductances on pivoting wave dynamics. The analysis conducted here enables us to better understand previous results on the termination of pivoting waves. We surmise the method put forth here could become a means to discover how to alter tissue conductances in a manner to terminate pivoting waves at the origin of reentrant tachycardias.", "journal": "Bulletin of mathematical biology", "date": "2019-06-16", "authors": ["JacquesBeaumont"], "doi": "10.1007/s11538-019-00623-y"}

Subsequently nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression levels were detected. In addition, fifty Kunming mice were randomized into control, N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), L-NAME+AqE, L-NAME+XJEK and L-NAME+fosinopril treatment groups. Following 8\u2009weeks of treatment, the cardiac hemodynamic index was measured, relaxation of the aorta was examined and pathological changes were observed. Colorimetric analysis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to determine the relevant indicators in plasma and cardiac tissues.\nThe in vitro study results demonstrated that AqE could preserve endothelial function (NO, 21.05\u2009\u00b1\u20092.03 vs. 8.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.59; eNOS, 1.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17 vs.0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06).

Extracellular matrix scaffold derived from a decellularized tissue has unique advantages to serve as an acellular cardiac patch due to its biomimetic nature. In this study, we examined the therapeutic outcomes of using a decellularized porcine myocardium slice (dPMS) as an acellular patch in a rat acute MI model. dPMSs with two different thicknesses (300 and 600 \u03bcm) were patched to the infarcted area of the rat myocardium, and their effects on cardiac function and host interactions were assessed. We found that the implanted dPMS firmly attached to host myocardium after implantation and prevented thinning of the left ventricular (LV) wall after an MI. A large number of host cells were identified to infiltrate into the implanted dPMS, and a significant number of vessel structures was observed in the dPMS and infarcted area. We detected a significantly higher density of M2 macrophages in the groups treated with dPMSs as compared to the MI group. Contraction of the LV wall and cardiac functional parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening) was significantly improved in the treatment groups (300 and 600 \u03bcm dPMS) 4 weeks after surgery.

{"title": "DNA methylation profiling allows for characterization of atrial and ventricular cardiac tissues and hiPSC-CMs.", "abstract": "Cardiac disease modelling using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) requires thorough insight into cardiac cell type differentiation processes. However, current methods to discriminate different cardiac cell types are mostly time-consuming, are costly and often provide imprecise phenotypic evaluation. DNA methylation plays a critical role during early heart development and cardiac cellular specification. We therefore investigated the DNA methylation pattern in different cardiac tissues to identify CpG loci for further cardiac cell type characterization.\nAn array-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips led to the identification of 168 differentially methylated CpG loci in atrial and ventricular human heart tissue samples (n\u2009=\u200949) from different patients with congenital heart defects (CHD). Systematic evaluation of atrial-ventricular DNA methylation pattern in cardiac tissues in an independent sample cohort of non-failing donor hearts and cardiac patients using bisulfite pyrosequencing helped us to define a subset of 16 differentially methylated CpG loci enabling precise characterization of human atrial and ventricular cardiac tissue samples. This defined set of reproducible cardiac tissue-specific DNA methylation sites allowed us to consistently detect the cellular identity of hiPSC-CM subtypes.\nTesting DNA methylation of only a small set of defined CpG sites thus makes it possible to distinguish atrial and ventricular cardiac tissues and cardiac atrial and ventricular subtypes of hiPSC-CMs. This method represents a rapid and reliable system for phenotypic characterization of in vitro-generated cardiomyocytes and opens new opportunities for cardiovascular research and patient-specific therapy.", "journal": "Clinical epigenetics", "date": "2019-06-13", "authors": ["KirstinHoff", "MartaLemme", "Anne-KarinKahlert", "KerstinRunde", "EnriqueAudain", "DoritSchuster", "JensScheewe", "TimAttmann", "ThomasPickardt", "AlmuthCaliebe", "ReinerSiebert", "Hans-HeinerKramer", "HendrikMilting", "ArneHansen", "OleAmmerpohl", "Marc-PhillipHitz"], "doi": "10.1186/s13148-019-0679-0\n10.1038/nature13544\n10.1038/nrg3354\n10.1038/nrg3230\n10.1016/0092-8674(91)90267-3\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.11.006\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0060022\n10.1038/nature09165\n10.1161/RES.0b013e3181f17dfe\n10.1002/ajmg.a.35896\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.07.035\n10.1371/journal.pone.0008564\n10.1080/15592294.2014.998536\n10.1038/ncomms6288\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1126/science.1151526\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.12.013\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311080\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1152/ajpheart.00007.2012\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300522\n10.1101/cshperspect.a014027\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.305365\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.10.024\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.003\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.3389/fphar.2016.00300\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.012\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.07.007\n10.1038/nature11247\n10.1101/gr.139105.112\n10.1093/nar/gkx1132\n10.1096/fj.14-264093\n10.1038/ncomms12923\n10.1101/gr.772403\n10.1093/nar/gkq963\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.10.008\n10.15252/emmm.201404757\n10.1074/jbc.M213132200\n10.1002/stem.2486\n10.1113/jphysiol.2008.167718\n10.1002/stem.2649\n10.1002/emmm.201201553\n10.1038/ng.2653\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131019\n10.1126/science.aaj2239\n10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002629\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.083\n10.1038/ng.650\n10.1016/j.tig.2013.11.004\n10.1186/s12864-017-4115-6\n10.1038/nature13992\n10.1038/nature13985\n10.1101/gr.1602203\n10.1016/j.tig.2008.04.005\n10.1126/science.283.5405.1161\n10.1128/MCB.21.5.1730-1736.2001\n10.4161/epi.6.1.13313\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1152/ajpcell.00402.2009\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00861-9\n10.1038/ng.2746\n10.1177/002215540104901004\n10.1038/cr.2010.163\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094722\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.032\n10.1016/j.gpb.2016.04.004\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1038/s41598-017-05600-w\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.008\n10.1172/JCI62838\n10.1186/1472-6750-7-21\n10.1038/emm.2017.10\n10.1038/nprot.2017.033\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.126714\n10.1038/nmeth.3115\n10.4161/epi.23470"}

{"title": "Volumetric optoacoustic tomography enables non-invasive in vivo characterization of impaired heart function in hypoxic conditions.", "abstract": "Exposure to chronic hypoxia results in pulmonary hypertension characterized by increased vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular remodeling, changes in functional parameters of the pulmonary vasculature, and right ventricular hypertrophy, which can eventually lead to right heart failure. The underlying mechanisms of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension have still not been fully elucidated while no curative treatment is currently available. Commonly employed pre-clinical analytic methods are largely limited to invasive studies interfering with cardiac tissue or otherwise ex vivo functional studies and histopathology. In this work, we suggest volumetric optoacoustic tomography (VOT) for non-invasive assessment of heart function in response to chronic hypoxia. Mice exposed for 3 consecutive weeks to normoxia or chronic hypoxia were imaged in vivo with heart perfusion tracked by VOT using indocyanide green contrast agent at high temporal (100\u2009Hz) and spatial (200\u2009\u00b5m) resolutions in 3D. Unequivocal difference in the pulmonary transit time was revealed between the hypoxic and normoxic conditions concomitant with the presence of pulmonary vascular remodeling within hypoxic models. Furthermore, a beat-to-beat analysis of the volumetric image data enabled identifying and characterizing arrhythmic events in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia.

Since air pollution toxicity is first direct to cardiorespiratory system, we compared the acute and sub-acute effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and biomass burning-derived particles (BB) on bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALf), lung and heart parenchyma. Markers of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation were analysed in male BALB/c mice submitted to single and repeated intra-tracheal instillations of 50 \u03bcg UFPs. This in-vivo study showed the activation of inflammatory response (COX-2 and MPO) after exposure to UFPs, both in respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Exposure to DEP results also in pro- and anti-oxidant (HO-1, iNOS, Cyp1b1, Hsp70) protein levels increase, although, stress persist only in cardiac tissue under repeated instillations. Statistical correlations suggest that stress marker variation was probably due to soluble components and/or mediators translocation of from first deposition site. This mechanism, appears more important after repeated instillations, since inflammation and oxidative stress endure only in heart. In summary, chemical composition of UFPs influenced the activation of different responses mediated by their components or pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative molecules, indicating DEP as the most damaging pollutant in the comparison.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2019-06-12", "authors": ["FrancescaFarina", "ElenaLonati", "ChiaraMilani", "LucaMassimino", "ElisaBallarini", "ElisabettaDonzelli", "LucaCrippa", "PaolaMarmiroli", "LauraBotto", "Paola AntoniaCorsetto", "GiulioSancini", "AlessandraBulbarelli", "PaolaPalestini"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms20112805\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.06.005\n10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181dbece1\n10.3109/08958378.2012.668229\n10.1007/s12012-016-9364-0\n10.1289/ehp.01109s4523\n10.1007/s11356-015-5666-1\n10.1289/ehp.7339\n10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.093\n10.1007/s11270-015-2726-6\n10.1289/ehp.01109s3395\n10.2741/2142\n10.1186/s12989-015-0082-8\n10.1016/j.jaerosci.2007.08.001\n10.1080/10473289.2007.10465322\n10.1007/s00204-016-1736-5\n10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.02.015\n10.1513/pats.200707-115TH\n10.1080/08958370600985875\n10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.125\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.05.023\n10.1016/j.envres.2008.05.004\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01442.x\n10.1186/1743-8977-10-20\n10.1080/08958370500189529\n10.1016/j.tox.2008.02.014\n10.1080/10934529.2014.854586\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056636\n10.1371/journal.pone.0106855\n10.1371/journal.pone.0109685\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.07218\n10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207020\n10.1164/rccm.200402-235OC\n10.1186/rr36\n10.1186/1465-9921-7-143\n10.3389/fimmu.2016.00003\n10.1189/jlb.0605353\n10.1189/jlb.1204697\n10.1183/09031936.00146510\n10.1016/j.etp.2005.05.004\n10.1186/rr44\n10.4049/jimmunol.181.3.2189\n10.1186/s12989-018-0277-x\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2007.11.005\n10.3109/08958378.2012.696221\n10.1165/rcmb.2006-0449OC\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.04.003\n10.1253/circj.CJ-10-0195\n10.1096/fj.06-7557com\n10.1373/clinchem.2009.126029\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn071\n10.1093/toxsci/kft146\n10.1016/j.envpol.2016.05.015\n10.1038/nrc2015\n10.1021/es803176k\n10.1242/jcs.01166\n10.1016/S0891-5849(03)00064-9\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.01.031\n10.1093/toxsci/kfp186\n10.1289/ehp.112-1241994\n10.1093/carcin/22.5.741\n10.1136/oem.54.9.662\n10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.05.130\n10.1093/carcin/22.7.1015\n10.1155/2016/5698931\n10.1089/ars.2012.5149\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.09.030\n10.1016/j.toxlet.2010.07.002\n10.2131/jts.38.71\n10.3109/08958370903527908\n10.1289/ehp.11370\n10.1289/ehp.8266\n10.1080/08958370490442827\n10.1093/nar/gky379\n10.1007/s11869-017-0530-8\n10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.003\n10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32643-0"}
{"title": "IMM-H007 improves heart function via reducing cardiac fibrosis.", "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction is a pathological state characterized by damaged ability of the left ventricle (LV) to either eject or fill blood accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. IMM-H007, an adenosine derivative, is an activator of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). AMPK can decrease the transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) expression during fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that IMM-H007 contributed to cardiac dysfunction by mediating cardiac fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we used angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac remodeling model treated with IMM-H007 or vehicle. Echocardiography measurements showed that IMM-H007 significantly improved heart function indicated by increased LV ejection fraction (%LVEF) and LV fractional shortening (%LVFS). Histological staining and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that IMM-H007 markedly reduced AngII-induced cardiac fibroblast activation (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin and periostin) and matrix protein production (Collagen I and Collagen III). However, IMM-H007 did not affect AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that IMM-H007 activated AMPK, decreased the expression of TGF-\u03b21, and inhibited the activation of Smad2 in heart tissues. In mouse primary cultured cardiac fibroblasts, pharmacological activation of AMPK by IMM-H007 significantly reduced AngII-induced TGF-\u03b21 expression as well. Consistently, in human cardiac fibroblasts-adult ventricular (HCF-av), IMM-H007 activated AMPK and markedly suppressed AngII-induced TGF-\u03b21 expression. These results together reveal that IMM-H007 improves heart function, and alleviates AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis by regulating AMPK-TGF-\u03b21 signaling.

However, their ability to preserve whole human organs are unknown.\nA total of 30 swine hearts were investigated. Three study groups (n = 10 in each case) were formed and classified on the type of fixative: (1) 10% formaldehyde phosphate-buffered solution (FPBS), (2) 10% alcohol-based honey solution (ABHS), (3) 10% water-based honey solution (WBHS). Samples were measured before fixation and in the following time points: 24 hours, 72 hours, 168 hours, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.\nThe WBHS failed to preserve heart samples and decomposition of tissues was observed one week after fixation.

Here, a simple approach to 3D-print thick, vascularized, and perfusable cardiac patches that completely match the immunological, cellular, biochemical, and anatomical properties of the patient is reported. To this end, a biopsy of an omental tissue is taken from patients. While the cells are reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, the extracellular matrix is processed into a personalized hydrogel. Following, the two cell types are separately combined with hydrogels to form bioinks for the parenchymal cardiac tissue and blood vessels. The ability to print functional vascularized patches according to the patient's anatomy is demonstrated. Blood vessel architecture is further improved by mathematical modeling of oxygen transfer. The structure and function of the patches are studied in vitro, and cardiac cell morphology is assessed after transplantation, revealing elongated cardiomyocytes with massive actinin striation.

{"title": "Spliced X-box Binding Protein 1 Stimulates Adaptive Growth Through Activation of mTOR.", "abstract": "The unfolded protein response plays versatile roles in physiology and pathophysiology. Its connection to cell growth, however, remains elusive. Here, we sought to define the role of unfolded protein response in the regulation of cardiomyocyte growth in the heart.\nWe used both gain- and loss-of-function approaches to genetically manipulate XBP1s (spliced X-box binding protein 1), the most conserved signaling branch of the unfolded protein response, in the heart. In addition, primary cardiomyocyte culture was used to address the role of XBP1s in cell growth in a cell-autonomous manner.\nWe found that XBP1s expression is reduced in both human and rodent cardiac tissues under heart failure. Furthermore, deficiency of XBP1s leads to decompensation and exacerbation of heart failure progression under pressure overload. On the other hand, cardiac-restricted overexpression of XBP1s prevents the development of cardiac dysfunction. Mechanistically, we found that XBP1s stimulates adaptive cardiac growth through activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling, which is mediated via FKBP11 (FK506-binding protein 11), a novel transcriptional target of XBP1s. Moreover, silencing of FKBP11 significantly diminishes XBP1s-induced mechanistic target of rapamycin activation and adaptive cell growth.\nOur results reveal a critical role of the XBP1s-FKBP11-mechanistic target of rapamycin axis in coupling of the unfolded protein response and cardiac cell growth regulation.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2019-06-11", "authors": ["XiaodingWang", "YingfengDeng", "GuangyuZhang", "ChaoLi", "GuanqiaoDing", "Herman IMay", "Diem HTran", "XiangLuo", "Ding-ShengJiang", "Dan LLi", "XiangWei", "LinXu", "AnwarulFerdous", "Thomas GGillette", "Philipp EScherer", "XuejunJiang", "Zhao VWang"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038924"}

Myocardium is a critical cardiac tissue with complex multiple muscular layers. Considering the specific characters of native cardiac tissues, it is necessary to design a biocompatible and biomimetic platform for cardiomyocyte culture and myocardium formation with sustained physiological function. In this study, we developed gelatin-based hydrogels chemically cross-linked by genipin, a biocompatible cross-linker, as cell culture scaffolds. Moreover, to achieve and maintain the functionality of myocardium, for instance, well-organized cardiomyocytes and synchronized contractile behavior, we fabricated gelatin-based hydrogels with patterned microstructure using a microcontact printing technique. Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO), with unprecedented physical and chemical properties, has also been incorporated into gelatin for culturing cardiomyocytes. Our results show that micropatterned genipin-cross-linked gelatin hydrogels are very helpful to promote alignment and maturation of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. More interestingly, the presence of GO significantly enhances the functional performance of cardiomyocytes, including an increase in contraction amplitude and cardiac gene expression. The cultured cardiomyocytes reach a well-synchronized contraction within 48 h of cell seeding and keep beating for up to 3 months.

Results showed PMCV to be largely homogenous in Irish samples, showing little genetic diversity. However, several amino acid positions within both ORF1 and ORF3 showed consistent variations unique to the Irish PMCV strains when compared with previously published Norwegian strains. The phylogeny generated in the present study suggests that PMCV may have been introduced into Ireland in two waves, both coming from the southern part of PMCV's range in Norway.

Transformation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was evaluated using scanning electron and confocal microscopy, and migration assays. Our results showed that SIM attenuated in vivo expression of collagen and collagen-associated protein, as well as collagen deposition, and cardiac fibrosis.

{"title": "Cardiotoxicity and pro-inflammatory effects of the immune checkpoint inhibitor Pembrolizumab associated to Trastuzumab.", "abstract": "The immunotherapy has revolutionized the world of oncology in the last decades with considerable advantages in terms of overall survival in cancer patients. The association of Pembrolizumab and Trastuzumab was recently proposed in clinical trials for the treatment of Trastuzumab-resistant advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Although immunotherapies are frequently associated with a wide spectrum of immune-related adverse events, the cardiac toxicity has not been properly studied.\nWe studied, for the first time, the putative cardiotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects of Pembrolizumab associated to Trastuzumab.\nCell viability, intracellular calcium quantification and pro-inflammatory studies (analyses of the production of Interleukin 1\u03b2, 6 and 8, the expression of NF-kB and Leukotriene B4) were performed in human fetal cardiomyocytes. Preclinical studies were also performed in C57BL6 mice by analyzing fibrosis and inflammation in heart tissues.\nThe combination of Pembrolizumab and Trastuzumab leads to an increase of the intracellular calcium overload (of 3 times compared to untreated cells) and to a reduction of the cardiomyocytes viability (of 65 and 20-25%, compared to untreated and Pembrolizumab or Trastuzumab treated cells, respectively) indicating cardiotoxic effects. Notably, combination therapy increases the inflammation of cardiomyocytes by enhancing the expression of NF-kB and Interleukins. Moreover, in preclinical models, the association of Pembrolizumab and Trastuzumab increases the Interleukins expression of 40-50% compared to the single treatments; the expression of NF-kB and Leukotriene B4 was also increased.\nPembrolizumab associated to Trastuzumab leads to strong cardiac pro-inflammatory effects mediated by overexpression of NF-kB and Leukotriene B4 related pathways.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2019-06-05", "authors": ["VQuagliariello", "MPassariello", "CCoppola", "DRea", "ABarbieri", "MScherillo", "M GMonti", "R VIaffaioli", "MDe Laurentiis", "P AAscierto", "GBotti", "CDe Lorenzo", "NMaurea"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.05.028"}

Their release kinetics have not been explored without confounding by heparin nor has their relationship to myocardial protein biomarkers.\nTo compare ncRNA types in heparinase-treated samples with established and emerging protein biomarkers for myocardial injury.\nScreening of 158 circRNAs and 21 lncRNAs in human cardiac tissue identified 12 circRNAs and 11 lncRNAs as potential biomarkers with cardiac origin. Eleven miRNAs were included. At low spike-in concentrations of myocardial tissue, significantly higher regression coefficients were observed across ncRNA types compared with cardiac troponins and cMyBP-C (cardiac myosin-binding protein C). Heparinase treatment of serial plasma and serum samples of patients undergoing transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy removed spurious correlations between miRNAs in non-heparinase-treated samples. After transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy, muscle-enriched miRNAs (miR-1 and miR-133a) showed a steeper and earlier increase than cardiac-enriched miRNAs (miR-499 and miR-208b). Putative cardiac lncRNAs, including LIPCAR (long intergenic noncoding RNA predicting cardiac remodeling and survival), did not rise, refuting a predominant cardiac origin. Cardiac circRNAs remained largely undetectable. In a validation cohort of acute myocardial infarction, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed noninferiority of cardiac-enriched miRNAs, but miRNAs failed to identify cases presenting with low troponin values. cMyBP-C was validated as a biomarker with highly sensitive properties, and the combination of muscle-enriched miRNAs with high-sensitive cardiac troponin T and cMyBP-C returned the highest area under the curve values.\nIn a comparative assessment of ncRNAs and protein biomarkers for myocardial injury, cMyBP-C showed properties as the most sensitive cardiac biomarker while miRNAs emerged as promising candidates to integrate ncRNAs with protein biomarkers.

PCMV is the causative agent of cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS), a severe cardiac disease that affects farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A recent study characterized the host immune response in infected salmon through a transcriptome immune profiling, which confirmed a high regulation of immune and anti-viral genes throughout infection with PCMV. Previously we developed a novel model based on repeated non-lethal blood sampling, enabling the individual monitoring of salmonids during an infection. In the present work, we used this model to describe the host immune response in the blood cells of Atlantic salmon after intramuscular infection with PCMV-containing tissue homogenate over a 77-day period. At the final stage heart samples were also collected to verify the PCMV load, the pathological impact of infection and to compare the transcript profiles to blood. The expression level of a range of key immune genes was determined in the blood and heart samples by real-time PCR. Results indicated selected immune genes (mx, cd8\u03b1 and \u03b3ip) were up-regulated in the heart tissue of infected animals at the terminal time point, in comparison to the non-infected fish. When analyzing the blood samples over the course of infection, a significant n up-regulation of mx gene was also observed. The time and number of peaks in the kinetics of expression was different between individuals. The PCMV load and CMS pathology was verified by real-time PCR and histopathology, respectively. No pathogen and no pathology could be detected during the course of the experiment except at the terminal stage (viral load by qPCR and pathology by histology).

{"title": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced iRhom2 up-regulation promotes macrophage-regulated cardiac inflammation and lipid deposition in high fat diet (HFD)-challenged mice: Intervention of fisetin and metformin.", "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) has been implicated in obesity-associated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2), also known as Rhbdf2, is an inactive member of the rhomboid intramembrane proteinase family, playing an essential role in regulating inflammation. Nevertheless, the role of ERS-meditated iRhom2 pathway in metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy remains unknown. In the study, we showed that 4-PBA, as an essential ERS inhibitor, significantly alleviated high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorder and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Additionally, lipid deposition in heart tissues was prevented by 4-PBA in HFD-challenged mice. Moreover, 4-PBA blunted the expression of iRhom2, TACE, TNFR2 and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB to prevent HFD-induced expression of inflammatory factors. Further, 4-PBA restrained HFD-triggered oxidative stress by promoting Nrf-2 signaling. Importantly, 4-PBA markedly suppressed cardiac ERS in HFD mice. The anti-inflammation, anti-ERS and anti-oxidant effects of 4-PBA were verified in palmitate (PAL)-incubated macrophages and cardiomyocytes. In addition, promoting ERS could obviously enhance iRhom2 signaling in vitro. Intriguingly, our data demonstrated that PAL-induced iRhom2 up-regulation apparently promoted macrophage to generate inflammatory factors that could promote cardiomyocyte inflammation and lipid accumulation. Finally, interventions by adding fisetin or metformin significantly abrogated metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy through the mechanisms mentioned above. In conclusion, this study provided a novel mechanism for metabolic stress-induced cardiomyopathy pathogenesis.

{"title": "Properties of cardiac conduction in a cell-based computational model.", "abstract": "The conduction of electrical signals through cardiac tissue is essential for maintaining the function of the heart, and conduction abnormalities are known to potentially lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The properties of cardiac conduction have therefore been the topic of intense study for decades, but a number of questions related to the mechanisms of conduction still remain unresolved. In this paper, we demonstrate how the so-called EMI model may be used to study some of these open questions. In the EMI model, the extracellular space, the cell membrane, the intracellular space and the cell connections are all represented as separate parts of the computational domain, and the model therefore allows for study of local properties that are hard to represent in the classical homogenized bidomain or monodomain models commonly used to study cardiac conduction. We conclude that a non-uniform sodium channel distribution increases the conduction velocity and decreases the time delays over gap junctions of reduced coupling in the EMI model simulations. We also present a theoretical optimal cell length with respect to conduction velocity and consider the possibility of ephaptic coupling (i.e. cell-to-cell coupling through the extracellular potential) acting as an alternative or supporting mechanism to gap junction coupling. We conclude that for a non-uniform distribution of sodium channels and a sufficiently small intercellular distance, ephaptic coupling can influence the dynamics of the sodium channels and potentially provide cell-to-cell coupling when the gap junction connection is absent.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2019-06-01", "authors": ["Karoline HorgmoJ\u00e6ger", "Andrew GEdwards", "AndrewMcCulloch", "AslakTveito"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007042\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2015.10.003\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00424\n10.1093/cvr/26.8.740\n10.1152/ajpheart.00760.2013\n10.1161/01.RES.48.1.39\n10.1161/01.RES.50.2.175\n10.1161/01.RES.0000056973.54305.67\n10.1152/ajpcell.1985.249.5.C447\n10.1113/jphysiol.1986.sp015934\n10.1016/0022-2828(75)90155-8\n10.1161/01.RES.50.2.192\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1997.tb00850.x\n10.1161/01.RES.86.3.302\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2004.06.010\n10.1007/s10439-009-9855-2\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.09.010\n10.1152/ajpheart.00868.2011\n10.1109/51.993199\n10.1016/j.bpj.2010.12.3716\n10.1007/s00285-008-0157-3\n10.1161/01.RES.0000046237.54156.0A\n10.1073/pnas.0801089105\n10.1161/01.RES.0000045656.34731.6D\n10.1073/pnas.1010154107\n10.1109/TBME.2012.2226720\n10.1016/j.bpj.2013.11.1117\n10.1007/s00424-014-1675-z\n10.1063/1.4999602\n10.1093/cvr/cvu195\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.08.004\n10.1091/mbc.E16-02-0125\n10.3389/fphys.2014.00511\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2003.09.017\n10.3389/fphy.2017.00048\n10.1161/01.RES.76.3.366\n10.1161/01.RES.83.11.1144\n10.1109/10.184699\n10.1016/S0006-3495(94)80971-3\n10.1109/TBME.2006.889172\n10.1088/1741-2560/10/2/026019\n10.1529/biophysj.108.137349\n10.1007/s10439-009-9883-y\n10.1007/s10439-005-7257-7\n10.3389/fncom.2017.00027\n10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009256\n10.1161/01.RES.66.6.1461\n10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012499\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.019\n10.1161/01.RES.81.5.727\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.07.005\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.11.035\n10.1152/ajpheart.2000.278.4.H1019\n10.1161/01.RES.36.5.654\n10.1054/jelc.2001.28833\n10.1093/europace/eum203\n10.1152/ajpheart.00689.2009\n10.1093/europace/eus267\n10.1152/ajpheart.00385.2013\n10.1016/0895-7177(91)90079-M\n10.1113/jphysiol.1977.sp011853\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.1152/ajpheart.00794.2003\n10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006\n10.1016/j.bpj.2012.04.038\n10.1152/ajpheart.00882.2004\n10.1016/S0248-4900(02)00022-9\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75687-1\n10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.01.008\n10.1016/j.bpj.2016.01.035\n10.1155/2015/936295\n10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75859-6\n10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.177bz.x\n10.1016/0022-5193(77)90114-X\n10.1016/j.bpj.2014.01.011\n10.1172/JCI119367\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.7.686\n10.1016/s0008-6363(01)00341-8\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1999.tb00192.x\n10.1161/hh1101.091107\n10.1161/01.RES.0000074916.41221.EA\n10.1161/01.RES.0000134923.05174.2f\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000117402.70689.75\n10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2003\n10.1113/JP275351"}

At the end of the experiment, histopathologic examination was performed. The T3, T4, TSH and myocardial malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements were performed with an ELISA kit. TUNEL assay was performed to demonstrate apoptosis. Sterile inflammation markers, caspase-1 and NLRP3, were investigated by immunohistochemistry and western blot.\nIn histopathological examination, we observed leukocyte infiltration, myocardial atrophy, pyknotic nucleated cells and cytoplasmic vacuolization in hypothyroid group whereas the control group showed normal structure. MDA levels in myocardial tissue were significantly high in hypothyroid group when compared to the control group (P<0.05). Myocardial apoptosis increased in hypothyroid group when compared to the control group. NLRP3 and caspase-1 immunoreactivity was higher in the hypothyroid group. In ELISA results, we found significantly higher level of TSH and lower levels of T3 and T4 in hypothyroid group when compared to the control group.\nHypothyroidism increased oxidative stress, and caused inflammatory alterations in cardiac tissue. In addition, our study also suggested that thyroid hormone deficiency would increase the amounts of cardiac NLRP3 and caspase-1 protein, which indicates that hypothyroidism exerts its destructive effects through sterile inflammation.

{"title": "Engineering stem cell cardiac patch with microvascular features representative of native myocardium.", "abstract": "The natural myocardium is a highly aligned tissue with an oriented vasculature. Its characteristic cellular as well as nanoscale extracellular matrix (ECM) organization along with an oriented vascular network ensures appropriate blood supply and functional performance. Although significant efforts have been made to develop anisotropic cardiac structure, currently neither an ideal biomaterial nor an effective vascularization strategy to engineer oriented and high-density capillary-like microvessels has been achieved for clinical cardiovascular therapies. A naturally derived oriented ECM nanofibrous scaffold mimics the physiological structure and components of tissue ECM and guides neovascular network formation. The objective of this study was to create an oriented and dense microvessel network with physiological myocardial microvascular features.\nHighly aligned decellularized human dermal fibroblast sheets were used as ECM scaffold to regulate physiological alignment of microvascular networks by co-culturing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). The influence of topographical features on hMSC and EC interaction was investigated to understand underlying mechanisms of neovasculature formation.\nResults demonstrate that the ECM topography can be translated to ECs via CD166 tracks and significantly improved hMSC-EC crosstalk and vascular network formation. The aligned ECM nanofibers enhanced structure, length, and density of microvascular networks compared to randomly organized nanofibrous ECM. Moreover, hMSC-EC co-culture promoted secretion of pro-angiogenic growth factors and matrix remodeling via metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) activation, which resulted in highly dense vascular network formation with intercapillary distance (20 \u03bcm) similar to the native myocardium.\nHMSC-EC co-culture on the highly aligned ECM generates physiologically oriented and dense microvascular network, which holds great potential for cardiac tissue engineering.", "journal": "Theranostics", "date": "2019-06-01", "authors": ["ZichenQian", "DhavanSharma", "WenkaiJia", "DanielRadke", "TimothyKamp", "FengZhao"], "doi": "10.7150/thno.29552"}
{"title": "Direct and Indirect Effect of Air Particles Exposure Induce Nrf2-Dependent Cardiomyocyte Cellular Response In Vitro.", "abstract": "Air particulate matter has been associated with adverse effects in the cardiorespiratory system leading to cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects. Particulate matter-associated cardiac effects may be direct or indirect. While direct interactions may occur when inhaled ultrafine particles and/or particle components cross the air-blood barrier reaching the cardiac tissue, indirect interactions may occur as the result of pulmonary inflammation and consequently the release of inflammatory and oxidative mediators into the blood circulation. The aim of the study is to investigate the direct or indirectly the effect of Urban Air particles from downtown Buenos Aires (UAP-BA) and residual oil fly ash (ROFA), a surrogate of ambient air pollution, on cardiomyocytes (HL-1 cells). HL-1 cultured cells were directly exposed to particulate matter [UAP-BA (10-200\u00a0\u00b5g/ml), ROFA (1-100\u00a0\u00b5g/ml)] or indirectly exposed to conditioned media (CM) from particle-exposed alveolar macrophages (AM). Metabolic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and Nrf2 expression were assessed by MTT, DHR 123, and immunocytochemistry techniques, respectively. We found that direct exposure of cardiomyocytes to UAP-BA or ROFA increased ROS generation but the oxidative damage did not alter metabolic activity likely by a concomitant increase in the cytoplasmic and nuclear Nrf2 expression. However, indirect exposure through CM caused a marked reduction on cardiac metabolic activity probably due to the rise in ROS generation without Nrf2 translocation into the cell nuclei. In this in vitro model, our results indicate both direct and indirect PM effects on cardiomyocytes cells in culture. Our findings employing lung and cardiomyocytes cells provide support to the hypothesis that particle-induced cardiac alteration may possibly involve lung-derived mediators.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2019-05-31", "authors": ["N SOrona", "FAstort", "G AMaglione", "J SYakisich", "D RTasat"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-019-09530-z"}
{"title": "Helium-Induced Changes in Circulating Caveolin in Mice Suggest a Novel Mechanism of Cardiac Protection.", "abstract": "The noble gas helium (He) induces cardioprotection in vivo through unknown molecular mechanisms. He can interact with and modify cellular membranes. Caveolae are cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched invaginations of the plasma-membrane-containing caveolin (Cav) proteins that are critical in protection of the heart. Mice (C57BL/6J) inhaled either He gas or adjusted room air. Functional measurements were performed in the isolated Langendorff perfused heart at 24 h post He inhalation. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry (EPR) of samples was carried out at 24 h post He inhalation. Immunoblotting was used to detect Cav-1/3 expression in whole-heart tissue, exosomes isolated from platelet free plasma (PFP) and membrane fractions. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy analysis of cardiac tissue and serum function and metabolomic analysis were performed. In contrast to cardioprotection observed in in vivo models, the isolated Langendorff perfused heart revealed no protection after He inhalation. However, levels of Cav-1/3 were reduced 24 h after He inhalation in whole-heart tissue, and Cav-3 was increased in exosomes from PFP. Addition of serum to muscle cells in culture or na\u00efve ventricular tissue increased mitochondrial metabolism without increasing reactive oxygen species generation. Primary and lipid metabolites determined potential changes in ceramide by He exposure. In addition to direct effects on myocardium, He likely induces the release of secreted membrane factors enriched in caveolae.

{"title": "In vitro aged, hiPSC-origin engineered heart tissue models with age-dependent functional deterioration to study myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Deaths attributed to ischemic heart disease increased by 41.7% from 1990 to 2013. This is primarily due to an increase in the aged population, however, research on cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been overlooking aging, a well-documented contributor to CVD. The use of young animals is heavily preferred due to lower costs and ready availability, despite the prominent differences between young and aged heart structure and function. Here we present the first human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte (iCM)-based, in vitro aged myocardial tissue model as an alternative research platform. Within 4\u202fmonths, iCMs go through accelerated senescence and show cellular characteristics of aging. Furthermore, the model tissues fabricated using aged iCMs, with stiffness resembling that of aged human heart, show functional and pharmacological deterioration specific to aged myocardium. Our novel tissue model with age-appropriate physiology and pathology presents a promising new platform for investigating CVD or other age-related diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In vitro and in vivo models of cardiovascular disease are aimed to provide crucial insight on the pathology and treatment of these diseases. However, the contribution of age-dependent cardiovascular changes is greatly underestimated through the use of young animals and premature cardiomyocytes. Here, we developed in vitro aged cardiac tissue models that mimic the aged heart tissue microenvironment and cellular phenotype and present the first evidence that age-appropriate in vitro disease models can be developed to gain more physiologically-relevant insight on development, progression, and amelioration of cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2019-05-31", "authors": ["AylinAcun", "Trung DungNguyen", "PinarZorlutuna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2019.05.064\n10.1007/s13398-014-0173-7.2\n10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.011\n10.1152/ajpheart.00564.2003\n10.1159/000113503\n10.1016/S00086363(97)00256-3\n10.1161/01.RES.0000093985.76901.AF\n10.1159/000213726\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2017.01.001\n10.1046/j.1365-2125.2003.02007.x\n10.1038/nm1295\n10.1177/0023677216653984\n10.1136/bmj.39048.407928.BE\n10.1063/1.4978468\n10.1016/j.actbio.2017.06.023\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318247f642\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019743\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2014.0283\n10.1016/j.bpj.2018.08.050\n10.1177/1849543516675348\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.064\n10.1002/adhm.201200194\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.3390/ijms18061173\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.099\n10.1152/physiolgenomics.00118.2011\n10.1016/j.gdata.2015.03.008\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.273144\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.11.005\n10.1016/j.gene.2015.06.027\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.03.005\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.223024\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037559\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1083/jcb.201508026\n10.1089/ten.TEC.2014.0283\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005046\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.10.033\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1038/nprot.2009.191\n10.1042/CS20110115\n10.18632/aging.100527\n10.1038/nm.4000\n10.1126/science.1122446\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000135591.37759.AF\n10.1016/j.cub.2013.10.057\n10.1096/fj.01-0759fje\n10.1002/mabi.201200471\n10.1016/S0142-9612(98)00025-8\n10.1088/1758-5090/7/4/045009\n10.1002/adhm.201500005\n10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb04433.x\n10.1038/s41598-017-05098-2\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200002)190:3<255::AID-PATH526>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1172/JCI62874\n10.1152/ajpheart.00428.2008\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181c37d69\n10.1161/01.RES.0000237390.92932.37\n10.1038/nrd2875\n10.1242/jcs.070490\n10.1002/jcp.20753\n10.1016/0022-2828(78)90364-4\n10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.12.002\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2016.03.003\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1155/2016/1718041\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.032\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.07.048\n10.1016/S15692590(08)60094-4\n10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039\n10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.011\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2012.00869.x\n10.1016/j.matbio.2015.03.009\n10.1038/nature09005\n10.1039/c5lc00820d\n10.1016/0047-6374(94)90099-X\n10.1006/jmcc.2000.1189\n10.1177/1074248409358408\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01093.x\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.04.008\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.11.015\n10.1073/pnas.1221972110\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2017.01.001\n10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00242-1\n10.1016/j.tcm.2009.12.004\n10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.07.009\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05091.x"}

In the present study, we induced RA in male Balb/c mice (CAIA) using collagen-antibody cocktail (C-Ab) and lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneal injections. Induction of RA in the animals was detected through the loss of body weight, food, and water consumption, pedal edema, increased arthritis score of the paw and ankle, increase in radiological and histological lesion score of ankle and knee joints and enhanced pain perception in the C-Ab induced RA animals.\u00a0Ashwashila is a herbo-mineral medicine\u00a0from Indian Ayurvedic system. Human equivalent doses of Ashwashila (ASHW) and standard of care, Methotrexate were given to the CAIA animals for two weeks. ASHW treatment significantly reversed the effect of C-Ab with reduced pedal edema, arthritis score, radiological and histological lesion scores in ankle-joint, knee-joint and articular cartilage, reduced pain perception. These effects were comparable with the Methotrexate treatment. In human monocytic (THP-1) cells, ASHW was found to be biocompatible at in-vitro test doses. The anti-arthritis mechanism of action for ASHW was established through the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1; and upstream regulator, NF-\u03baB.

Circulating fibrosis markers procollagen type III C-peptide (PIIINP), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases I (TIMP-1) levels were checked at baseline and after three and six months of treatment.\nThe clinical benefit of PD manifested by improved NYHA functional class and reduced hospitalization rate. Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels decreased significantly during the treatment. Serum MMP-2 and TIMP-1 decreased significantly on PD. Circulating PIIINP showed two patterns of change, either decreased or increased following PD treatment. Patients in whom circulating PIIINP decreased had significantly lower baseline serum albumin, lower baseline mean arterial blood pressure, higher serum CRP, and a less significant improvement in hospitalization rate compared to the patients in whom circulating PIIINP increased.

{"title": "Dynamic UTR Usage Regulates Alternative Translation to Modulate Gap Junction Formation during Stress and Aging.", "abstract": "Connexin43 (Cx43; gene name GJA1) is the most ubiquitously expressed gap junction protein, and understanding of its regulation largely falls under transcription and post-translational modification. In addition to Cx43, Gja1 mRNA encodes internally translated isoforms regulating gap junction formation, whose expression is modulated by TGF-\u03b2. Here, using RLM-RACE, we identify distinct Gja1 transcripts differing only in 5' UTR length, of which two are upregulated during TGF-\u03b2 exposure and hypoxia. Introduction of these transcripts into Gja1-/- cells phenocopies the response of Gja1 to TGF-\u03b2 with reduced internal translation initiation. Inhibiting pathways downstream of TGF-\u03b2 selectively regulates levels of Gja1 transcript isoforms and translation products.

{"title": "Circulating exosomes deliver free fatty acids from the bloodstream to cardiac cells: Possible role of CD36.", "abstract": "Regulation of circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels and delivery is crucial to maintain tissue homeostasis. Exosomes are nanomembranous vesicles that are released from diverse cell types and mediate intercellular communication by delivering bioactive molecules. Here, we sought to investigate the uptake of FFAs by circulating exosomes, the delivery of FFA-loaded exosomes to cardiac cells and the possible role of the FFA transporter CD36 in these processes. Circulating exosomes were purified from the serum of healthy donors after an overnight fast (F) or 20 minutes after a high caloric breakfast (postprandial, PP). Western blotting, Immunogold Electron Microscopy and FACS analysis of circulating exosomes showed that CD36 was expressed under both states, but was higher in postprandial-derived exosomes. Flow cytometry analysis showed that circulating exosomes were able to take-up FFA directly from serum. Importantly, preincubation of exosomes with a blocking CD36 antibody significantly impeded uptake of the FFA analogue BODIPY, pointing to the role of CD36 in FFA exosomal uptake. Finally, we found that circulating exosomes could delivery FFA analogue BODIPY into cardiac cells ex vivo and in vivo in a mice model. Overall, our results suggest a novel mechanism in which circulating exosomes can delivery FFAs from the bloodstream to cardiac tissue. Further studies will be necessary to understand this mechanism and, in particular, its potential involvement in metabolic pathologies such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2019-05-30", "authors": ["N AGarcia", "HGonz\u00e1lez-King", "EGrueso", "RS\u00e1nchez", "AMartinez-Romero", "BJ\u00e1vega", "J EO'Connor", "P JSimons", "AHandberg", "PSep\u00falveda"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0217546\n10.1152/ajplegacy.1964.206.1.153\n10.1172/JCI112820\n10.1172/JCI106264\n10.1172/JCI103324\n10.1055/s-2007-990273\n10.2337/diabetes.51.9.2684\n10.2337/db11-0425\n10.1093/cvr/cvv260\n10.1038/nm.2753\n10.1194/jlr.M003657\n10.1038/s41467-017-02406-2\n10.1002/0471143030.cb0322s30\n10.1038/nutd.2013.1\n10.1016/j.micron.2008.01.001\n10.1186/s13068-015-0220-4\n10.1016/j.cmet.2011.12.018\n10.1042/BJ20020747\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.626135\n10.1172/JCI14006\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66378-7"}

{"title": "Extracellular vesicles from regenerative human cardiac cells act as potent immune modulators by priming monocytes.", "abstract": "Nano-sized vesicles, so called extracellular vesicles (EVs), from regenerative cardiac cells represent a promising new therapeutic approach to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, it is not yet sufficiently understood how cardiac-derived EVs facilitate their protective effects. Therefore, we investigated the immune modulating capabilities of EVs from human cardiac-derived adherent proliferating (CardAP) cells, which are a unique cell type with proven cardioprotective features.\nDifferential centrifugation was used to isolate EVs from conditioned medium of unstimulated or cytokine-stimulated (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) CardAP cells. The derived EVs exhibited typical EV-enriched proteins, such as tetraspanins, and diameters mostly of exosomes (<\u2009100\u00a0nm). The cytokine stimulation caused CardAP cells to release smaller EVs with a lower integrin \u00df1 surface expression, while the concentration between both CardAP-EV variants was unaffected. An exposure of either CardAP-EV variant to unstimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) did not induce any T cell proliferation, which indicates a general low immunogenicity. In order to evaluate immune modulating properties, PBMC cultures were stimulated with either Phytohemagglutin or anti-CD3. The treatment of those PBMC cultures with either CardAP-EV variant led to a significant reduction of T cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory cytokine release (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) and increased levels of active TGF\u03b2.

{"title": "Impact and tissue metabolism of nitrite at two acclimation temperatures in striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus).", "abstract": "Elevated concentrations of nitrite develop occasionally in various aquatic habitats and aquaculture facilities, providing a potential danger for freshwater fish that take up nitrite via the gill chloride uptake mechanism. We studied the uptake, effects and metabolism of nitrite in blood, heart and skeletal muscle at two temperatures in striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, a facultative air-breathing fish that is heavily cultivated in Southeast Asia. Exposure to 0.8\u2009mM ambient nitrite increased blood [nitrite] and [methaemoglobin] (metHb) to high values at day 1, but values subsequently decreased towards controls at day 7. Blood [nitrite] and metHb content were unexpectedly higher at 27\u2009\u00b0C (\u223c1.2\u2009mM; 69% at day 1) than at 33\u2009\u00b0C (\u223c0.9\u2009mM; 55%), reflecting a lower nitrite uptake at the highest temperature, possibly via an increased reliance on air-breathing relative to water-breathing with temperature increase. A large fraction of the nitrite taken up was effectively eliminated by being detoxified to nitrate. Further, erythrocyte metHb reductase activity was increased during nitrite exposure, efficiently reducing metHb to functional haemoglobin. The uptake of nitrite into white skeletal musculature (main part of the fish) was much lower than into heart tissue. While heart [nitrite] was close to blood plasma levels, muscle [nitrite] peaked at \u223c0.2\u2009mM at day 1 and subsequently declined to \u223c0.05\u2009mM at day 7, which is below levels reported in various commercial cured meat products. Nitrite was partly metabolized to iron-nitrosyl, S-nitroso and N-nitroso compounds.

We tracked metrics of cardiac function as continuous variables during temperature changes (~\u200931 to 39\u00a0\u00b0C), eliciting a well-defined reduction in metabolic demand and in heart rate modulation.

{"title": "Mechanics of the Tricuspid Valve-From Clinical Diagnosis/Treatment, In-Vivo and In-Vitro Investigations, to Patient-Specific Biomechanical Modeling.", "abstract": "Proper tricuspid valve (TV) function is essential to unidirectional blood flow through the right side of the heart. Alterations to the tricuspid valvular components, such as the TV annulus, may lead to functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR), where the valve is unable to prevent undesired backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium during systole. Various treatment options are currently available for FTR; however, research for the tricuspid heart valve, functional tricuspid regurgitation, and the relevant treatment methodologies are limited due to the pervasive expectation among cardiac surgeons and cardiologists that FTR will naturally regress after repair of left-sided heart valve lesions. Recent studies have focused on (i) understanding the function of the TV and the initiation or progression of FTR using both in-vivo and in-vitro methods, (ii) quantifying the biomechanical properties of the tricuspid valve apparatus as well as its surrounding heart tissue, and (iii) performing computational modeling of the TV to provide new insight into its biomechanical and physiological function. This review paper focuses on these advances and summarizes recent research relevant to the TV within the scope of FTR.

{"title": "Novel Therapies for Prevention and Early Treatment of Cardiomyopathies.", "abstract": "Heritable cardiomyopathies are a class of heart diseases caused by variations in a number of genetic loci. Genetic variants on one allele lead to either a degraded protein, which causes a haploinsufficiency of that protein, or a nonfunctioning protein that subverts the molecular system within which the protein works. Over years, both of these mechanisms eventually lead to diseased heart tissue and symptoms of a failing heart. Most cardiomyopathy treatments repurpose heart failure drugs to manage these symptoms and avoid adverse outcomes. There are few therapies that correct the underlying pathogenic genetic or molecular mechanism. This review will reflect on this unmet clinical need in genetic cardiomyopathies and consider a variety of therapies that address the mechanism of disease rather than patient symptoms. These therapies are genetic, targeting a defective gene or transcript, or ameliorating a genetic insufficiency. However, there are also a number of small molecules under exploration that modulate downstream faulty protein products affected in cardiomyopathies.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2019-05-24", "authors": ["Giuliana GRepetti", "Christopher NToepfer", "Jonathan GSeidman", "Christine ESeidman"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.313569\n10.1038/s41436-018-0375-z\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehy600\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314505\n10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.08.041"}
{"title": "Mechanically Biomimetic Gelatin-Gellan Gum Hydrogels for 3D Culture of Beating Human Cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "To promote the transition of cell cultures from 2D to 3D, hydrogels are needed to biomimic the extracellular matrix (ECM). One potential material for this purpose is gellan gum (GG), a biocompatible and mechanically tunable hydrogel. However, GG alone does not provide attachment sites for cells to thrive in 3D. One option for biofunctionalization is the introduction of gelatin, a derivative of the abundant ECM protein collagen. Unfortunately, gelatin lacks cross-linking moieties, making the production of self-standing hydrogels difficult under physiological conditions. Here, we explore the functionalization of GG with gelatin at biologically relevant concentrations using semiorthogonal, cytocompatible, and facile chemistry based on hydrazone reaction. These hydrogels exhibit mechanical behavior, especially elasticity, which resembles the cardiac tissue. The use of optical projection tomography for 3D cell microscopy demonstrates good cytocompatibility and elongation of human fibroblasts (WI-38). In addition, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes attach to the hydrogels and recover their spontaneous beating in 24 h culture. Beating is studied using in-house-built phase contrast video analysis software, and it is comparable with the beating of control cardiomyocytes under regular culture conditions. These hydrogels provide a promising platform to transition cardiac tissue engineering and disease modeling from 2D to 3D.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2019-05-24", "authors": ["Janne TKoivisto", "ChristineGering", "JennikaKarvinen", "ReejaMaria Cherian", "BirhanuBelay", "JariHyttinen", "KatriinaAalto-Set\u00e4l\u00e4", "MinnaKellom\u00e4ki", "JennyParraga"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.8b22343\n10.1126/science.8493529\n10.1016/j.drudis.2012.12.005\n10.1016/j.drudis.2016.10.011\n10.1007/s11626-010-9297-z\n10.1093/toxsci/kfv201\n10.1002/stem.1331\n10.1161/circulationaha.113.001883\n10.1371/journal.pone.0125366\n10.1056/nejmra032426\n10.1186/1475-925x-13-39\n10.1186/s40064-016-1889-y\n10.1089/aivt.2016.0002\n10.1089/ten.teb.2017.0081\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.010\n10.1038/nmeth.2524\n10.1002/adfm.201605352\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.003\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.09.038\n10.1016/s0268-005x(01)00021-2\n10.1088/1748-605x/aa62b0\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.04.006\n10.1016/j.msec.2017.12.013\n10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2017.12.019\n10.1021/bm0606869\n10.1021/bm990017d\n10.1039/c6tb01488g\n10.1039/c4tb01727g\n10.1002/adhm.201700686\n10.1002/jbm.a.34650\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.045\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.050\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.09.037\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.04.024\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.12.034\n10.1364/boe.5.003443\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.06.035\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1016/j.ijcha.2015.04.008\n10.1038/nprot.2012.150\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2015.12.013\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1016/s0168-3659(97)00242-3\n10.3109/10409238.2013.770819\n10.1016/0032-3861(83)90001-0\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.01.033\n10.1038/srep08883\n10.1016/j.actbio.2016.05.033\n10.1002/adhm.201500757\n10.1002/adhm.201500005\n10.1161/01.res.33.2.233\n10.1039/b610522j\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0330\n10.1179/1743280413y.0000000022\n10.1002/bit.22647\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1039/c3tb21280g\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.03.064\n10.1002/pi.4683\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.033\n10.1016/0014-4827(61)90192-6\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.03.008\n10.1007/s10616-017-0088-1\n10.1007/s12265-018-9801-5\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.09.010\n10.7150/thno.19441"}

While SCD affects many patients suffering from coronary artery diseases (CAD) and heart failure (HF), a considerable number of SCD events occur in asymptomatic individuals. Certain risk factors for SCD have been identified and incorporated in different clinical scores, however, risk stratification using such algorithms is only useful for health management rather than for early detection and prediction of future SCD events in high-risk individuals. In this review, we discuss different molecular biomarkers that are used for early detection of SCD. This includes genetic biomarkers, where the majority of them are genomic variants for genes that encode for ion channels. Meanwhile, protein biomarkers often denote proteins that play roles in pathophysiological processes that lead to CAD and HF, notably (i) atherosclerosis that involves oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as (ii) cardiac tissue damage that involves neurohormonal and hemodynamic regulation and myocardial stress.

However, its therapeutic uses are hampered by side effects associated with cumulative doses during the course of treatment. Whereas deregulation of autophagy in the myocardium has been involved in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, the role of autophagy in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy remains debated. Our earlier studies have shown that DOX treatment in a rat animal model leads to increased expression of the novel stress-inducible protein insulin-like growth factor II receptor-\u03b1 (IGF-IIR\u03b1) in cardiac tissues, which exacerbated the cardiac injury by enhancing oxidative stress and p53-mediated mitochondria-dependent cardiac apoptosis. Through this study, we investigated the contribution of IGF-IIR\u03b1 to dysregulation of autophagy in heart using both in vitro H9c2 cells (DOX treated, 1 \u00b5M) and in vivo transgenic rat models (DOX treated, 5 mg/kg ip for 6 wk) overexpressing IGF-IIR\u03b1 specifically in the heart.

However, it is not clear whether PN also negatively impacts cardiac tissue. The present empirical study investigated the cardiac effects of PN in rabbits.\nThe effects of PN were examined in three groups of rabbits: animals in the PN\u202f+\u202ffasting group (n\u202f=\u202f14) had been fully fasted before receiving a full PN dose via an intravenous central catheter; the PN\u202f+\u202foral feeding group (n\u202f=\u202f14) received half of the daily calorie requirement as a half dose of PN via an intravenous central catheter; the third group consisted of controls (n\u202f=\u202f14) with full enteral feeding and full enteral fluid intake with no PN and no central venous catheter. At the end of the 10-day study period, the rabbits were subjected to echocardiographic examination and euthanized. Blood and tissue samples were obtained from all groups. DNA was isolated from nucleated blood cells. Tissue samples were examined by both light and electron microscopy, relative telomere length was determined from DNA, and blood samples were analyzed biochemically.\nAt the end of the study, there were no statistically significant differences in weight change between the three groups. Echocardiography revealed minimally impaired diastolic function in the PN\u202f+\u202ffasting group compared to the other groups. Biochemical and histopathological analyses, relative telomere length determination, and electron micrographs showed significant cardiac damage in the PN\u202f+\u202ffasting group but not in the PN\u202f+\u202foral feeding group or the control group. The blood biochemical analyses showed hyperglycemia and a low insulin level in the PN\u202f+\u202ffasting group but not in the other two groups.\nA combination of PN and fasting may damage the cardiac muscle cells of rabbits via a mechanism involving hyperglycemia and oxidative stress.

Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, of which the gastrodin group was treated with gastrodin, and the other two groups were treated with normal saline. In the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model group, myocardial ischemia was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and myocardial reperfusion was performed by ligature removal. Only thread without ligation for the sham operation group was conducted. The rats were euthanized 8 days after surgery. Heart tissues were harvested and used for measurement of apoptotic rate and expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins. Serum levels of cytokines were measured also using blood samples. Compared with the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model group, significant reduction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was observed in the gastrodin group (P<0.05). In the gastrodin group, the protein and mRNA expression levels for Bax and activated caspase-3 decreased, while for Bcl-2 increased (P<0.05). Gastrodin can downregulate inflammatory cytokines (P<0.05) and upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (P<0.05) in serum of SD rats.

In cardiac tissue, electrical shocks induce simultaneously de- and hyperpolarized areas and only depolarized areas are considered to be responsible for VA termination. Because electrical shocks do not allow proper control over spatial extent and level of membrane potential changes, the effects of hyperpolarization have not been explored in the intact heart. In contrast, optogenetic methods allow cell type-selective induction of de- and hyperpolarization with unprecedented temporal and spatial control. To investigate effects of cardiomyocyte hyperpolarization on VA termination, we generated a mouse line with cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the light-driven proton pump ArchT.

{"title": "Optimizing Epicardial Restraint and Reinforcement Following Myocardial Infarction: Moving Towards Localized, Biomimetic, and Multitherapeutic Options.", "abstract": "The mechanical reinforcement of the ventricular wall after a myocardial infarction has been shown to modulate and attenuate negative remodeling that can lead to heart failure. Strategies include wraps, meshes, cardiac patches, or fluid-filled bladders. Here, we review the literature describing these strategies in the two broad categories of global restraint and local reinforcement. We further subdivide the global restraint category into biventricular and univentricular support. We discuss efforts to optimize devices in each of these categories, particularly in the last five years. These include adding functionality, biomimicry, and adjustability.

The extracellular space index (ECSI) was estimated by the ratio \u03c3'(100\u202fHz)/\u03c3'(1\u202fMHz). Intercalated water was analysed in electron microscopy images of the myocardial samples and was used to calculate the extracellular space index ECSI\nAt the onset of ischaemia, the ECSI was significantly higher than the ECSI\nThe estimation of cell oedema with the ECSI is reliable only after GJU.

{"title": "Current research trends and challenges in tissue engineering for mending broken hearts.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The shortage of donor hearts to treat end-stage heart failure patients is a critical problem. An average of 3500 heart transplant surgeries are performed globally, half of these transplants are performed in the US alone. Stem cell therapy is growing rapidly as an alternative strategy to repair or replace the damaged heart tissue after a myocardial infarction (MI). Nevertheless, the relatively poor survival of the stem cells in the ischemic heart is a major challenge to the therapeutic efficacy of stem-cell transplantation. Recent advancements in tissue engineering offer novel biomaterials and innovative technologies to improve upon the survival of stem cells as well as to repair the damaged heart tissue following a myocardial infarction (MI). However, there are several limitations in tissue engineering technologies to develop a fully functional, beating cardiac tissue. Therefore, the main goal of this review article is to address the current advancements and barriers in cardiac tissue engineering to augment the survival and retention of stem cells in the ischemic

Clinical abnormalities included weight loss, hyperaesthesia of the neck and back, cardiac murmur and systemic muscle atrophy. The cat died 10 days after the initial presentation and a necropsy examination was performed. Grossly, extensive pale lesions were seen in the wall of the left ventricle and the septum of the heart. There were no detectable masses in the heart, skeletal muscles or peripheral nerves. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse, extensive infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells in the heart; the cardiac muscles were markedly degenerate and atrophic and were replaced by the neoplastic cells. Neoplastic cells with similar morphology were seen in all specimens of the skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves. Clonality analysis of the paraffin wax-embedded heart tissue revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of the gene encoding the T-cell receptor \u03b3 chain.

However, its clinical application may be hampered by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Alcohol metabolite and doxorubicinol (DOXol) were the most prominent components in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. It is necessary to elucidate the level of DOXol in heart in vivo and whether DOXol could cause toxicity at such a concentration.\nThe pharmacokinetics and heart distribution of DOX and its second metabolite DOXol were determined in rats. Based on this concentration level in vivo, H9C2 cell was used to examine the cardiotoxicity of DOX and DOXol. Real-time cell viability was determined using the xCelligence system and the membrane-permeable of DOX, and DOXol was also assessed by determining the intracellular and extracellular concentrations.\nOur data showed that DOX level was higher than DOXol level in heart tissue. DOX had a high level in intracellular H9C2 cell and was the primary cytotoxic agent. DOXol had a significantly low level in heart tissue and less cytotoxicity than that of DOX in H9C2. DOXol in heart could not diffuse from plasma but only form in the heart. DOXol could not enter cell as easy as DOX.

{"title": "Application of a chemiluminescence immunoassay system and GC/MS for toxicological investigations on skeletonized human remains.", "abstract": "Hair, larvae and cardiac muscle, the only biological samples present on a skeletonized human body found in a rural area, were used for forensic toxicological analyses in order to determine possible causes of death. Since no information about the victim or the circumstances of death was available (except for the place where the corpse was found, known to be a gathering place for drug addicts), the first approach for the analysis of non-conventional matrices involved the screening of different classes of active principles, using a chemiluminescence-based screening assay designed for whole blood. The immunoassay test results showed positivity to amphetamines, cocaine and opiates on water/methanol extract from cardiac tissue, larvae and hair samples.

{"title": "Qishen granule attenuates cardiac fibrosis by regulating TGF-\u03b2 /Smad3 and GSK-3\u03b2 pathway.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathological progress of cardiovascular disease resulting from the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2/SMADs pathway is a canonical signaling pathway which directly induces expressions of ECM related genes. Qishen Granule (QSG), a traditional Chinese formula developed from Zhen-Wu Decoration for heart failure (HF), has been proven to have definite therapeutic effects on cardiac fibrosis. However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\nTo investigate the effects of QSG on TGF-\u03b2 pathway and the downstream mediators including Smad3 and Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2.\nHF model was induced by ligation of left coronary artery on male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Rat were randomly divided into four groups including sham group, model group, QSG group and Fosinopril control group. Rats in each group were treated for 28 days, and 2D echocardiography was adopted to evaluate the heart function. The degree of cardiac fibrosis was assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE), Masson's trichrome and Picrosirius red (PSR) staining. Contents of collagen \u2160 and \u2162 were assessed by immunohistochemical method. Expressions of genes and proteins in TGF-\u03b2/SMADs and PI3K-GSK-3 signaling pathways were detected by Real-time Fluorescence Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot respectively. TGF-\u03b21-treated cardiac fibroblasts of neonatal SD rats were adopted for in vitro studies.\n28 days after the surgery, cardiac ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) values in the model group showed a remarkable decrease, indicating the induction of HF model. QSG and Fosinopril elevated the EF and FS values, demonstrating cardio-protective effects. Pathological staining and immunohistochemistry showed that the contents of collagen I and III dramatically increased in the cardiac tissue of the model group compared with the sham group while QSG treatment reduced collagen contents. Furthermore, expressions of TGF-\u03b21, p-Smad3 and p-GSK-3\u03b2 were significantly decreased in the QSG treatment group compared with the model group, suggesting that the QSG may attenuate cardiac fibrosis through regulating TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 pathway. In vitro study further showed that the productions of type \u2160 and \u2162 collagen and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) of cardiac fibroblasts were significantly increased by incubation with TGF-\u03b21. QSG could markedly reduce the secretion of collagen \u2160 and \u2162 and \u03b1-SMA expression. Protein expressions of p-Smad3, PI3K, p-Akt and p-GSK-3\u03b2 were significantly up-regulated by stimulation of TGF-\u03b21. Treatment with QSG could suppress the activity of Smad3 and PI3K-GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts.\nQSG improves cardiac function through inhibiting cardiac fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic effects are potentially mediated by the inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2/Smad3 pathway and the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2.", "journal": "Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology", "date": "2019-05-19", "authors": ["ZifanZeng", "QiyanWang", "XiaominYang", "YingluRen", "ShihongJiao", "QingqingZhu", "DongqingGuo", "KaiXia", "YongWang", "ChunLi", "WeiWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152949"}

However, the functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs in cardiomyocytes have not been fully elucidated. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to identify the differently expressed lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rats and healthy controls. One novel lncRNA FGF9-associated factor (termed FAF) and mRNAs in AMI rats were verified by bioinformatics, real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Moreover, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to determine the location of lncRNA. Subsequently, a series of in vitro assays were used to observe the functions of lncRNA FAF in cardiomyocytes. The expression of lncRNA FAF and FGF9 were remarkably decreased in ischemia-hypoxia cardiomyocytes and heart tissues of AMI rats. Overexpression of FAF could significantly inhibit cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by ischemia and hypoxia. Conversely, knockdown of lncRNA FAF could promote apoptosis in ischemia-hypoxia cardiomyocytes. Moreover, overexpression of lncRNA FAF could also increase the expression of FGF9. Knockdown of the FGF9 expression could promote apoptosis in cardiomyocytes with the insult of ischemia and hypoxia, which was consistent with the effect of lncRNA FAF overexpression on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, FGF9 inhibited cardiomyocytes apoptosis through activating signaling tyrosine kinase FGFR2 via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. Thus, lncRNA FAF plays a protective role in ischemia-hypoxia cardiomyocytes and may serve as a treatment target for AMI.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2019-05-17", "authors": ["Hao-JieShi", "Ming-WeiWang", "Jia-TengSun", "HaoWang", "Ya-FeiLi", "Bing-RuiChen", "YiFan", "Si-BoWang", "Zi-MuWang", "Qi-MingWang", "Lian-ShengWang"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.28760"}

Moreover, OCA decreased oxidant products and increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) expression and the expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes. Injection of LV-shFXR downregulated FXR expression and inhibited all these beneficial effects of OCA. FXR is major target that mediated that beneficial effect of OCA. In summary, FXR/Nrf2 signaling was involved in OCA-induced amelioration of metabolic disorder, oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and myocardial dysfunction.

Patients usually rely on these medications for the remainder of their lives after diagnosis. Although the acute pharmacological actions of CCBs in the hearts are well-defined, little is known about the drug-specific effects on human cardiomyocyte transcriptomes and physiological alterations after long-term exposure.\nThis study aimed to simulate chronic CCB treatment and to examine both the functional and transcriptomic changes in human cardiomyocytes.\nWe differentiated cardiomyocytes and generated engineered heart tissues from 3 human induced pluripotent stem cell lines and exposed them to 4 different CCBs-nifedipine, amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil-at their physiological serum concentrations for 2 weeks. Without inducing cell death and damage to myofilament structure, CCBs elicited line-specific inhibition on calcium kinetics and contractility. While all 4 CCBs exerted similar inhibition on calcium kinetics, verapamil applied the strongest inhibition on cardiomyocyte contractile function. By profiling cardiomyocyte transcriptome after CCB treatment, we identified little overlap in their transcriptome signatures. Verapamil is the only inhibitor that reduced the expression of contraction-related genes, such as MYH (myosin heavy chain) and troponin I, consistent with its depressive effects on contractile function. The reduction of these contraction-related genes may also explain the responsiveness of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to verapamil in managing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\nThis is the first study to identify the transcriptome signatures of different CCBs in human cardiomyocytes.

To recapitulate human heart tissue, we combined human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with a chitosan-enhanced extracellular-matrix (ECM) hydrogel, derived from decellularized pig hearts. Ultrastructural characterization of the ECM-derived engineered heart tissues (ECM-EHTs) revealed an anisotropic muscle structure, with embedded cardiomyocytes showing more mature properties than 2D-cultured hiPSC-CMs. Force measurements confirmed typical force-length relationships, sensitivity to extracellular calcium, and adequate ionotropic responses to contractility modulators. By combining genetically-encoded calcium and voltage indicators with laser-confocal microscopy and optical mapping, the electrophysiological and calcium-handling properties of the ECM-EHTs could be studied at the cellular and tissue resolutions. This allowed to detect drug-induced changes in contraction rate (isoproterenol, carbamylcholine), optical signal morphology (E-4031, ATX2, isoproterenol, ouabin and quinidine), cellular arrhythmogenicity (E-4031 and ouabin) and alterations in tissue conduction properties (lidocaine, carbenoxolone and quinidine). Similar assays in ECM-EHTs derived from patient-specific hiPSC-CMs recapitulated the abnormal phenotype of the long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Finally, programmed electrical stimulation and drug-induced pro-arrhythmia led to the development of reentrant arrhythmias in the ECM-EHTs. In conclusion, a novel ECM-EHT model was established, which can be subjected to high-resolution long-term serial functional phenotyping, with important implications for cardiac disease modeling, drug testing and precision medicine. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: One of the main objectives of cardiac tissue engineering is to create an in-vitro muscle tissue surrogate of human heart tissue.

{"title": "Actions and Potential Therapeutic Applications of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone Agonists.", "abstract": "In this article, we briefly review the identification of GHRH, provide an abridged overview of GHRH antagonists, and focus on studies with GHRH agonists. Potent GHRH agonists of JI and MR class were synthesized and evaluated biologically. Besides the induction of the release of pituitary GH, GHRH analogs promote cell proliferation and exert stimulatory effects on various tissues, which express GHRH receptors (GHRH-Rs). A large body of work shows that GHRH agonists, such as MR-409, improve pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation and metabolic functions and facilitate engraftment of islets after transplantation in rodents. Accordingly, GHRH agonists offer a new therapeutic approach to treating diabetes. Various studies demonstrate that GHRH agonists promote repair of cardiac tissue, producing improvement of ejection fraction and reduction of infarct size in rats, reduction of infarct scar in swine, and attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy in mice, suggesting clinical applications. The presence of GHRH-Rs in ocular tissues and neuroprotective effects of GHRH analogs in experimental diabetic retinopathy indicates their possible therapeutic applications for eye diseases. Other effects of GHRH agonists, include acceleration of wound healing, activation of immune cells, and action on the central nervous system. As GHRH might function as a growth factor, we examined effects of GHRH agonists on tumors. In vitro, GHRH agonists stimulate growth of human cancer cells and upregulate GHRH-Rs. However, in vivo, GHRH agonists inhibit growth of human cancers xenografted into nude mice and downregulate pituitary and tumoral GHRH-Rs. Therapeutic applications of GHRH analogs are discussed.

{"title": "Bioengineering adult human heart tissue: How close are we?", "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have extensive applications in fundamental biology, regenerative medicine, disease modelling, and drug discovery/toxicology. Whilst large numbers of cardiomyocytes can be generated from hPSCs, extensive characterization has revealed that they have immature cardiac properties.

Currently, the best approach for driving maturity is the use of tissue engineering to generate highly functional three-dimensional heart tissue. Although we have made significant progress in this area, we have still not generated heart tissue that fully recapitulates all the properties of an adult heart. Deciphering the processes driving cardiomyocyte maturation will be instrumental in uncovering the mechanisms that govern optimal heart function and identifying new therapeutic targets for heart disease.", "journal": "APL bioengineering", "date": "2019-05-10", "authors": ["Richard JMills", "James EHudson"], "doi": "10.1063/1.5070106\n10.1126/science.282.5391.1145\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1038/nrg3563\n10.14814/phy2.12159\n10.1038/nature01262\n10.1073/pnas.1214608110\n10.1038/ng.3929\n10.1161/01.RES.84.11.1310\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.281.3.H1217\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.002\n10.1016/j.tcm.2003.12.006\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.034\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00345\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00346\n10.1152/ajpregu.2000.278.1.R215\n10.1089/ten.tea.2015.0242\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.310738\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.04.011\n10.1634/stemcells.2004-0184\n10.1038/nature06894\n10.1242/dev.143966\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0743\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.12.008\n10.1038/nmeth.1740\n10.1073/pnas.1200250109\n10.1038/nmeth.2999\n10.1038/nbt.3745\n10.1172/jci.insight.99941\n10.1016/j.stem.2017.07.003\n10.1242/dmm.030320\n10.1016/j.cophys.2017.08.003\n10.1126/science.aaa5458\n10.1038/nm.3545\n10.1038/srep24637\n10.1093/toxsci/kfu312\n10.1093/toxsci/kfu186\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024145\n10.1073/pnas.1707316114\n10.1073/pnas.1208863110\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031542\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034886\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.026\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3\n10.1073/pnas.0407817101\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00019-4\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000029803.93022.93\n10.1074/jbc.R110.214403\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311920\n10.1161/01.RES.0000074908.17214.FD\n10.1161/JAHA.116.005135\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0095344\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094722\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.11.008\n10.3389/fphys.2013.00102\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00959\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.12.021\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.003638\n10.1016/j.devcel.2008.12.007\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028252\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.001\n10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-061010-114257\n10.1038/nrm3896\n10.1242/jcs.029678\n10.1073/pnas.1508073112\n10.1016/j.bpj.2009.02.019\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.043\n10.1002/cm.20290\n10.1126/science.1146885\n10.3390/s16081258\n10.1038/srep11800\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.055\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.251843\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.08.003\n10.1096/fasebj.11.8.9240969\n10.1161/hh0202.103644\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.211458\n10.1038/nprot.2009.155\n10.1038/srep42290\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.001560\n10.1242/dev.143438\n10.1016/S0006-3495(95)80278-X\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.12.024\n10.1038/nm1394\n10.1007/s00395-012-0307-z\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0341\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.860171\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.016\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.05.009\n10.1161/01.CIR.85.5.1743\n10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00387-9\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e74a14\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.024\n10.1073/pnas.1424042112\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.08.069\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.01.067\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014998\n10.1038/srep24726\n10.1371/journal.pone.0026397\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.039\n10.1007/978-1-4939-7283-8\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aao0052\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302095\n10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.032\n10.1016/j.clp.2016.04.001\n10.1152/physrev.1992.72.2.507\n10.1186/1477-5956-10-64\n10.1152/ajpheart.00514.2007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.1084/jem.20171274\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001878\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001879\n10.1007/s11010-009-0251-x\n10.1038/nbt.4162\n10.1038/srep19111\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.11.016\n10.3945/ajcn.2010.29885\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0214\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.030\n10.1038/nature15695"}

{"title": "Imaging the injured beating heart intravitally and the vasculoprotection afforded by haematopoietic stem cells.", "abstract": "Adequate microcirculatory perfusion, and not just opening of occluded arteries, is critical to salvage heart tissue following myocardial infarction. However, the degree of microvascular perfusion taking place is not known, limited primarily by an inability to directly image coronary microcirculation in a beating heart in vivo. Haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) offer a potential therapy but little is known about their homing dynamics at a cellular level and whether they protect coronary microvessels. This study used intravital microscopy to image the anaesthetized mouse beating heart microcirculation following stabilization.\nA 3D-printed stabilizer was attached to the ischaemia-reperfusion injured (IRI) beating heart. The kinetics of neutrophil, platelet and HSPC recruitment, as well as functional capillary density (FCD), was imaged post-reperfusion. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) was used for the first time to monitor ventricular blood flow in beating hearts. Sustained hyperaemic responses were measured throughout reperfusion, initially indicating adequate flow resumption. Intravital microscopy confirmed large vessel perfusion but demonstrated poor transmission of flow to downstream coronary microvessels. Significant neutrophil adhesion and microthrombus formation occurred within capillaries with the latter occluding them, resulting in patchy perfusion and reduced FCD. Interestingly, 'patrolling' neutrophils were also observed in capillaries. Haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells readily trafficked through the heart but local retention was poor. Despite this, remarkable anti-thromboinflammatory effects were observed, consequently improving microvascular perfusion.\nWe present a novel approach for imaging multiple microcirculatory perturbations in the beating heart with LSCI assessment of blood flow. Despite deceptive hyperaemic responses, increased microcirculatory flow heterogeneity was seen, with non-perfused areas interspersed with perfused areas. Microthrombi, rather than neutrophils, appeared to be the major causative factor. We further applied this technique to demonstrate local stem cell presence is not a pre-requisite to confer vasculoprotection.

{"title": "Group A streptococcal M-protein specific antibodies and T-cells drive the pathology observed in the rat autoimmune valvulitis model.", "abstract": "Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are autoimmune mediated diseases triggered by group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Molecular mimicry between GAS M-proteins and host tissue proteins has been proposed as the mechanism that initiates autoreactive immune responses in ARF/RHD. However, the individual role of antibodies and T-cells specific for GAS M-proteins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune carditis remains under-explored. The current study investigated the role of antibodies and T-cells in the development of carditis in the Lewis rat autoimmune valvultis (RAV) model by transferring serum and/or splenic T-cells from rats previously injected with GAS recombinant M5 protein. Here we report that serum antibodies alone and serum plus in vitro expanded rM5-specific T-cells from hyperimmune rats were capable of transferring carditis to na\u00efve syngeneic animals. Moreover, the rats that received combined serum and T-cells developed more severe carditis. Recipient rats developed mitral valvulitis and myocarditis and showed prolongation of P-R intervals in electrocardiography. GAS M5 protein-specific IgG reactivity and T-cell recall response were also demonstrated in recipient rats indicating long-term persistence of antibodies and T-cells following transfer. The results suggest that both anti-GAS M5 antibodies and T-cells have differential propensity to induce autoimmune mediated carditis in syngeneic rats following transfer. The results highlight that antibodies and effector T-cells generated by GAS M protein injection can also independently home into cardiac tissue to cross-react with tissue proteins causing autoimmune mediated immunopathology.", "journal": "Autoimmunity", "date": "2019-05-08", "authors": ["SuchandanSikder", "GeorginaPrice", "Md AbdulAlim", "AnilGautam", "RobertScott Simpson", "CatherineMargaret Rush", "BrendaLee Govan", "NatkunamKetheesan"], "doi": "10.1080/08916934.2019.1605356"}

A series of CNT/PU nanocomposites with different weight ratios (2:10, 3:10, and 6:10wt%) were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy, conductivity analysis, water contact angle measurements, and tensile tests were used to characterize the scaffolds. FESEM showed that CNTs were adhered on PU nanofibers and created an interconnected web-like structures. The SEM images also revealed that the diameters of nanofibers were decreased by increasing CNTs. The electrical conductivity, tensile strength, Young's modulus, and hydrophilicity of CNT/PU nanocomposites also enhanced after adding CNTs. The scaffolds revealed suitable cytocompatibility for H9c2 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

To assess their impact at micro and macroscopic level, multi-resolution imaging techniques that provide high quality images without sample alteration and in 3D are necessary: requirements not fulfilled by most of current methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the non-destructive time-efficient 3D multiscale capabilities of synchrotron Propagation-based X-Ray Phase Contrast Imaging (PB-X-PCI) to study a wide range of cardiac tissue characteristics in one healthy and three different diseased rat models. With a dedicated image processing pipeline, PB-X-PCI images are analysed in order to show its capability to assess different cardiac tissue components at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The presented technique evaluates in detail the overall cardiac morphology, myocyte aggregate orientation, vasculature changes, fibrosis formation and nearly single cell arrangement. Our results agree with conventional histology and literature. This study demonstrates that synchrotron PB-X-PCI, combined with image processing tools, is a powerful technique for multi-resolution structural investigation of the heart ex-vivo.

Effective treatment of this clinical situation still remains to be discovered. In this experimental animal study, we aimed to define therapeutic effects of liraglutide, oxytocin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in DXR-induced cardiomyopathy model. 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were included to study. 32 rats were given doxorubicin (DXR) for cardiomyopathy model. DXR was administered intraperitonally (i.p.) at every other day of 2.5\u00a0mg/kg/day at six times. Eight rats were taken as normal group and no treatment was performed. 32 rats given doxorubicin were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 rats were assigned to a placebo group and was given with a 0.9% NaCl saline solution at a dose of 1\u00a0ml/kg/day i.p.

(DXR\u2009+\u2009OX), Group 4 rats were given with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day filgrastim i.p. (DXR\u2009+\u2009G-CSF). All medications were given for 15\u00a0days. On day 16, under anesthesia, ECG was recorded from derivation I. After that, blood samples were taken by tail vein puncture for biochemical analysis. Finally, the animals were euthanized and the heart removed and prepared for immunohistochemical examination. All three treatments were shown to ameliorate the toxic effect of doxorubicin in cardiac tissue with the best results in DXR\u2009+\u2009OX group.

{"title": "Cardioprotection of PLGA/gelatine cardiac patches functionalised with adenosine in a large animal model of ischaemia and reperfusion injury: A feasibility study.", "abstract": "The protection from ischaemia-reperfusion-associated myocardial infarction worsening remains a big challenge. We produced a bioartificial 3D cardiac patch with cardioinductive properties on stem cells. Its multilayer structure was functionalised with clinically relevant doses of adenosine. We report here the first study on the potential of these cardiac patches in the controlled delivery of adenosine into the in vivo ischaemic-reperfused pig heart. A Fourier transform infrared chemical imaging approach allowed us to perform a characterisation, complementary to the histological and biochemical analyses on myocardial samples after in vivo patch implantation, increasing the number of investigations and results on the restricted number of pigs (n\u00a0=\u00a04) employed in this feasibility step. In vitro tests suggested that adenosine was completely released by a functionalised patch, a data that was confirmed in vivo after 24\u00a0hr from patch implantation. Moreover, the adenosine-loaded patch enabled a targeted delivery of the drug to the ischaemic-reperfused area of the heart, as highlighted by the activation of the pro-survival signalling reperfusion injury salvage kinases pathway. At 3\u00a0months, though limited to one animal, the used methods provided a picture of a tissue in dynamic conditions, associated to the biosynthesis of new collagen and to a non-fibrotic outcome of the healing process underway. The synergistic effect between the functionalised 3D cardiac patch and adenosine cardioprotection might represent a promising innovation in the treatment of reperfusion injury. As this is a feasibility study, the clinical implications of our findings will require further in vivo investigation on larger numbers of ischaemic-reperfused pig hearts.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2019-05-06", "authors": ["CaterinaCristallini", "GiuseppeVaccari", "NiccolettaBarbani", "ElisaCibrario Rocchietti", "RossellaBarberis", "MimmoFalzone", "KarineCabiale", "GiovanniPerona", "ElenaBellotti", "RaffaellaRastaldo", "SilviaPascale", "PasqualePagliaro", "ClaudiaGiachino"], "doi": "10.1002/term.2875\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00228\n10.1002/bip.20069\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.09.058\n10.1155/2016/7176154\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e31803c55fe\n10.2174/187152908783884966\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2004.02.003\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2009.10.002\n10.1016/S0003-2697(03)00039-3\n10.1093/cvr/cvx049\n10.1056/NEJMe0803746\n10.1007/s10544-006-9013-7\n10.1039/c2ib20067h\n10.1152/ajpheart.00675.2006\n10.1016/S1054-8807(98)00024-6\n10.1016/0925-4439(95)00118-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.101.18.2154\n10.1152/ajpheart.00612.2007\n10.1016/j.jcin.2013.02.009\n10.1016/0002-8703(92)90643-A\n10.1093/cvr/cvq129\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00287\n10.1111/bph.12975\n10.1002/jbm.a.32216\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.02.061\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2017.02.025\n10.1152/ajpheart.00553.2011\n10.1177/1753944712446670\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181f03d05\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.08.009\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.752865\n10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.12.005\n10.2174/187152909789007025\n10.1056/NEJMra071667\n10.1152/ajpheart.00264.2011\n10.1007/s10557-010-6240-1\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.01.052"}

Imbalance of iron homeostasis occurs in several cardiac diseases, including iron-overload cardiomyopathies such as Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, OMIM no. 229300), a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. Exploiting the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology and the iPSC capacity to differentiate into specific cell types, we derived cardiomyocytes of a FRDA patient and of a healthy control subject in order to study the cardiac iron homeostasis and the HAMP-FPN axis. Both CTR and FRDA iPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes express cardiac differentiation markers; in addition, FRDA cardiomyocytes maintain the FRDA-like phenotype. We found that FRDA cardiomyocytes show an increase in the protein expression of HAMP and FPN. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed for the first time an unexpected nuclear localization of FPN in both CTR and FRDA cardiomyocytes. However, the amount of the nuclear FPN was less in FRDA cardiomyocytes than in controls. These and other data suggest that iron handling and the HAMP-FPN axis regulation in FRDA cardiac cells are hampered and that FPN may have new, still not fully understood, functions.

Studies performed on isolated rat heart mitochondria also showed that OP2113 does not affect oxidative phosphorylation driven by complex I or complex II substrates. We assessed the effect of OP2113 on an infarct model of ex vivo rat heart in which mitochondrial ROS production is highly involved and showed that OP2113 protects heart tissue as well as the recovery of heart contractile activity.\nThis work represents the first demonstration of a drug authorized for use in humans that can prevent mitochondria from producing ROS/H2O2. OP2113 therefore appears to be a member of the new class of mitochondrial ROS blockers (S1QELs) and could protect mitochondrial function in numerous diseases in which ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction occurs.

Hsp22 also increases oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mechanisms mediating LV hypertrophy, senescence and reduced lifespan. Therefore, we investigated whether ROS production mediates LV hypertrophy, senescence and reduced life span in Hsp22 TG mice. Survival curves revealed that TG mice had a 48% reduction in their mean life span compared to wild type (WT) mice. This was associated with a significant increase in senescence markers, such as p16, p19 mRNA levels as well as the percentage of \u03b2-galactosidase positive cells and telomerase activity. Oxidized (GSSG)/reduced (GSH) glutathione ratio, an indicator of oxidative stress, and ROS production from 3 major cellular sources was measured in cardiac tissue. Hearts from TG mice exhibited a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio together with increased ROS production from all sources. To study the role of ROS, mice were treated with the antioxidant Tempol from weaning to their sacrifice. Chronic Tempol treatment abolished oxidative stress and overproduction of ROS, and reduced myocardial hypertrophy and Akt phosphorylation in TG mice. Tempol also significantly extended life span and prevented aging markers in TG mice. Taken together these results show that overexpression of Hsp22 increases oxidative stress responsible for the induction of hypertrophy and senescence and ultimately reduction in life span.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2019-05-03", "authors": ["DidierMorin", "RomainLong", "MathieuPanel", "LydieLaure", "AdelaTaranu", "CindyGueguen", "SandrinePons", "ValerioLeoni", "ClaudioCaccia", "Stephen FVatner", "Dorothy EVatner", "HongyuQiu", "ChristopheDepre", "AlainBerdeaux", "BijanGhaleh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2019.04.035"}

Dysglycemia is also thought to exert an anabolic effect on heart tissue by hyperinsulinemia and thereby promoting increased LVM. The primary aim of this study was to assess the influence of dysglycemia on LVM evaluated by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in patients admitted with a first myocardial infarction (MI) without hypertension. The secondary aim was to assess the impact of dysglycemia on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality during long-term follow-up.\nPatients admitted with a first MI without known history of hypertension were included. All patients without previously known type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had a standardized 2-hour OGTT performed and were categorized as: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and newly detected T2DM (new T2DM). LVM was measured by echocardiography using Devereaux formula and indexed by body surface area. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to assess the impact of confounders (dysglycemia by OGTT, known T2DM, age, sex and type of MI) on LVM. Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the impact of dysglycemia on all-cause mortality and a composite endpoint of MACE (all-cause mortality, MI, revascularisation due to stable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke).\nTwo-hundred-and-five patients were included and followed up to 14\u2009years.

This study intended to explore the gene differential expression in naturally aged mice exposed to selenium by RNA-Seq technique. A total spectrum of 53 differentially expressed genes was quantified in mice heart tissues treated with Se-rich and general rice. The GO functional annotation of differentially expressed genes disclosed the enrichment of cellular process, ionic binding, biological regulation, and catalytic activity. One hundred twenty-three differential pathways (cardiovascular diseases, immune system, transport and catabolism, longevity regulating, and PI3K-AKT signaling) were identified according to KEGG metabolic terms. Afterwards, the effect of Se-rich rice on the antioxidant activity was assessed. The selenium-rich diet increased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in mice serum and livers while significantly reduces methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) contents. FOXO1 and FOXO3 genes, which acted as the regulators of apoptosis and the antioxidant enzyme, were significantly enhanced in mice when fed with Se-rich rice.

Blood samples and heart tissues were then collected for further analyses. A UPLC-QTOF/MS-based metabolomics analysis of the plasma was performed, and all metabolic features were fit by PCA and OPLS-DA pattern for the biomarker screen. The identified biomarkers were later implemented into a metabolic pathway analysis. Furthermore, we used qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses to verify the treatment effects of the XFZY capsules.\nA total of 49 metabolites (VIP>1.0, p\u202f<\u202f0.05, RSD%<20%) were identified in the Model rats, and 27 metabolites (VIP>1.0, p\u202f<\u202f0.05, RSD%<20%) were identified in the XFZY-H rats. The results of the pathway analysis indicated that the XFZY capsules treated CHD primarily by regulating cardiac energy, phospholipid, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and amino acid metabolism. In addition, blood viscosity and serum lipid assays suggested that XFZY capsules could decrease serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and whole blood viscosity at a low shear rate.\nThis study demonstrated that the XFZY capsule effectively decreases serum lipids and whole blood viscosity in CHD with BSS. The underlying metabolic mechanism mainly included improving cardiac energy supply, reducing phospholipid peroxide, maintaining the PUFA metabolic balance and regulating amino acid metabolism.", "journal": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "date": "2019-04-29", "authors": ["YuhangZhao", "ShanshanNie", "MinYi", "NingWu", "WenboWang", "ZheyuZhang", "YeYao", "DongshengWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jep.2019.111908"}

The present study was conducted to investigate the ameliorative and antioxidant effects of cerebrolysin (CBL) on isoproterenol-induced MI in rats.\nMI was induced in the rats by subcutaneously injecting 100\u202fmg/kg of isoproterenol (ISO) in the first two days. The serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were measured on the third day to confirm MI. The post-treatment involved intraperitoneally injecting 5\u202fml/kg of CBL for 7\u202fdays. Nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) in the heart tissue and catalase (CAT) and serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were measured on the 10th day using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Histopathological examinations of the heart tissue were also performed.\nThe present results suggested significant increases in CK-MB, cTnI, MDA and NO. A significant decrease was also observed in the ISO-treated rats in certain antioxidant enzymes, including CAT and GPX. CBL administration showed a significant ameliorative increase against the oxidative ISO-induced damage.

However, current MSC-delivery methods result in poor donor cell engraftment, limiting the therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, we introduce here a novel technique, epicardial placement of bi-layered, adhesive dressings incorporating MSCs (MSC-dressing), which can be easily fabricated from a fibrin sealant film and MSC suspension at the site of treatment. The inner layer of the MSC dressing, an MSC-fibrin complex, promptly and firmly adheres to the heart surface without sutures or extra glues. We revealed that fibrin improves the potential of integrated MSCs through amplifying their tissue-repair abilities and activating the Akt/PI3K self-protection pathway. Outer collagen-sheets protect the MSC-fibrin complex from abrasion by surrounding tissues and also facilitates easy handling. As such, the MSC-dressing technique not only improves initial retention and subsequent maintenance of donor MSCs but also augment MSC's reparative functions. As a result, this technique results in enhanced cardiac function recovery with improved myocardial tissue repair in a rat ischemic cardiomyopathy model, compared to the current method. Dose-dependent therapeutic effects by this therapy is also exhibited. This user-friendly, highly-effective bioengineering technique will contribute to future success of MSC-based therapy.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2019-04-27", "authors": ["KazuyaKobayashi", "YukiIchihara", "NobuhikoSato", "NobuyoshiUmeda", "LauraFields", "MasafumiFukumitsu", "YoshiyukiTago", "TomoyaIto", "SatoshiKainuma", "MihaiPodaru", "FionaLewis-McDougall", "KenichiYamahara", "RakeshUppal", "KenSuzuki"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.04.014"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective roles of sestrin 1 and sestrin 2 against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy medication widely used to treat a variety of cancers. Even though it offers one of the most effective anti-cancer treatments, its clinical use is limited because of its strong cardiotoxicity that can lead to fatal conditions. Here, we show that sestrin 1 and sestrin 2, members of the sestrin family of proteins that are stress-inducible regulators of metabolism, are critical for suppressing doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and coordinating the AMPK-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) autophagy signaling network for cardioprotection. Expression of both sestrin 1 and sestrin 2 was highly increased in the mouse heart after doxorubicin injection. Genetic ablation of sestrin 1 and sestrin 2 rendered mice more vulnerable to doxorubicin and exacerbated doxorubicin-induced cardiac pathologies including cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction. These pathologies were associated with strong dysregulation of the cardiac signaling network, including suppression of the AMPK pathway and activation of the mTORC1 pathway. Consistent with AMPK downregulation and mTORC1 upregulation, autophagic activity of heart tissue was diminished, leading to prominent accumulation of autophagy substrate, p62/SQSTM1. Taken together, our results indicate that sestrin 1 and sestrin 2 are important cardioprotective proteins that coordinate metabolic signaling pathways and autophagy to minimize cardiac damage in response to doxorubicin insult. Augmenting this protective mechanism could provide a novel therapeutic rationale for prevention and treatment of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. ", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "AHU377+Valsartan (LCZ696) Modulates Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) in the Cardiac of Female Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats Compared With Valsartan.", "abstract": "Hypertension is a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide and is increasing in prevalence. The Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is the most common mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Understanding the mechanism of the pathophysiologic processes will help direct potential therapeutic strategies to treat hypertension and improve cardiac function. Recently, a novel drug LCZ696 containing both an angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and a neprilysin inhibitor (AHU377) has shown a promising effect on the treatment of hypertension. However, the effects of LCZ696 on the expression of main components of RAS, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 R), angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2 R), and angiotensin (1-7) receptor/Mas receptor (MasR) remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of LCZ696 on the protective arms of RAS in the cardiac tissue when compared with valsartan under the equal inhibition of AT1 R. We hypothesized that the superior effects of LCZ696 may contribute to its greater effect on the RAS than valsartan.\nSixteen-week-old female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were used in this study. Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. All rats were randomly divided into LCZ696 (n = 10), valsartan (n = 10), SHR (n = 10), and WKY (n = 10) groups under a 12-hour dark and 12-hour light cycle and provided with regular chow diet and water. The tail-cuff method was performed to measure blood pressure. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography.\nThe blood pressure value was lower in LCZ696 than valsartan in SHR after 12 weeks of treatment. Further, LCZ696 inhibits the ACE and AT1 R protein expression in the cardiac of SHR and significantly upregulate the protective axis of RAS components, including ACE2, MasR, and AT2 R. Left ventricular AT2 R messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was higher in the LCZ696+SHR group compared with valsartan. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that LCZ696 enhanced the mRNA expression of antihypertensive components AT2 R, ACE2, and MasR and decreased the expression of AT1 R. However, only AT2 R and ACE2 mRNA expressions have a statistical difference between the LCZ696 and valsartan groups. No difference was observed in the mRNA expression of ACE and MasR. The stronger positive signal of transforming growth factor \u03b2 in the left ventricle was inhibited in each administrated group compared with SHR groups.\nLCZ696 ameliorates the vasoconstrictor axis of the RAS AT1 R and stimulate the protective arm effectors, ACE2 and AT2 R, as well as reverses the compensatory upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in SHR. These findings suggest the mechanistic insight of the cardiac-protective and greater hypotensive effects of LCZ696.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics", "date": "2019-04-27", "authors": ["YangZhao", "RuixinMa", "XiaorongYu", "NingyinLi", "XuZhao", "JingYu"], "doi": "10.1177/1074248419838503"}
{"title": "Effect of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Ischaemic-Reperfused Hearts in Adult Rats with Established Chronic Kidney Disease.", "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are adult multipotent non-haematopoietic stem cells that have regeneration potential. The current study aimed to detect the ability of BM-MSCs to improve kidney and cardiac functions in adult rats with established chronic kidney disease.\nRats were divided into sham-operated control, untreated sub totally nephrectomised and treated sub totally nephrectomised groups. Body weight, kidney and cardiac tissue weights, plasma creatinine and urea levels and arterial blood pressure were measured. ECG was recorded, and an in vitro isolated heart study was performed.\nStem cell treatment decreased the elevated plasma creatinine and urea levels and decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure values. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in glomerular hypertrophy with apparent normal renal parenchyma. Additionally, BM-MSCs shortened Q-To and Q-Tc intervals, all time to peak tension values, the half relaxation value at 30 min of reperfusion and the contraction time at 15 and 30 min of reperfusion.

{"title": "Link between cardiac function and the antioxidative defense mechanism in aged rats.", "abstract": "Aging presents profound structural and physiological changes in the cardiovascular system. Oxidative stress, a major contributing factor during the aging process, has been involved in various age-related cardiovascular pathologies. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of oxidative stress in the aging heart is still unclear. This study was designed to determine whether changes in cardiac structure and function in aged rats were associated with decreases in the antioxidative defense mechanism. Young (3-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rats were used in this study, and the differences in function, structure, antioxidative capacity and the expression of antioxidative-related proteins between the two groups were compared. By using echocardiography, we observed that compared to young rats, the left ventricular internal end-diastolic diameter (LVID; d) and left ventricular volume at diastole (LV Vol; d) were significantly increased in aged rats, while the MV E/A (E wave and A wave ratio, the ratio of peak velocity of early to late filling of mitral inflow), which represents heart diastolic function, was significantly decreased in aged rats. In addition, we observed degenerative histological modifications and an increased number of apoptotic cells in aged rats. We further detected the protein expression of catalase (CAT), glutathione synthetase (GSS), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in cardiac tissue. Western blot results showed that the expression of GSS was significantly decreased and that the expressions of CAT, SOD-1, and HO-1 were slightly decreased in aged rats. Immunohistochemistry results further confirmed the decreased expression of GSS, SOD-1 and NQO1 in cardiomyocytes in aged rats. Taken together, our data suggest that aging may affect the morphology and function of the heart by oxidative stress and the antioxidative defense mechanism.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2019-04-24", "authors": ["XinQian", "Sabahat BinteAsad", "JiaxinLi", "JiaoWang", "DeqinWei", "YuanZhao", "YueWang", "HuiZhu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.182"}
{"title": "Cardioprotection Conferred by Sitagliptin Is Associated with Reduced Cardiac Angiotensin II/Angiotensin-(1-7) Balance in Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease.", "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitors are antidiabetic agents that exert renoprotective actions independently of glucose lowering. Cardiac dysfunction is one of the main outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the effects of DPPIV inhibition on cardiac impairment during CKD progression remain elusive. This study investigated whether DPPIV inhibition mitigates cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in rats with a 5/6 renal ablation and evaluated if these effects are associated with changes in the cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS). To this end, male Wistar rats underwent a 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) or sham operation, followed by an 8-week treatment period with the DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin (IDPPIV) or vehicle. Nx rats had lower glomerular filtration rate, overt albuminuria and higher blood pressure compared to sham rats, whereas CKD progression was attenuated in Nx + IDPPIV rats. Additionally, Nx rats exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which were associated with higher cardiac DPPIV activity and expression. The sitagliptin treatment prevented cardiac fibrosis and mitigated cardiac hypertrophy. The isovolumic relaxation time (IRVT) was higher in Nx than in sham rats, which was suggestive of CKD-associated-diastolic dysfunction. Sitagliptin significantly attenuated the increase in IRVT. Levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the heart tissue from Nx rats were higher while those of angiotensin-(1-7) Ang-(1-7) were lower than that in sham rats. This cardiac hormonal imbalance was completely prevented by sitagliptin. Collectively, these results suggest that DPPIV inhibition may delay the onset of cardiovascular impairment in CKD. Furthermore, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that a crosstalk between DPPIV and the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the pathophysiology of cardiorenal syndromes.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2019-04-24", "authors": ["Juliana IsaBeraldo", "AcarisBenetti", "Fl\u00e1vio Ara\u00fajoBorges-J\u00fanior", "Daniel FArruda-Junior", "Flavia Let\u00edciaMartins", "LeonardoJensen", "RafaelDariolli", "Maria HeloisaShimizu", "Antonio CSeguro", "Weverton MLuchi", "Adriana C CGirardi"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms20081940\n10.1056/NEJMoa1307684\n10.2337/dc14-1850\n10.1186/1471-2369-14-98\n10.1016/j.kint.2016.01.016\n10.1038/labinvest.2016.34\n10.1371/journal.pone.0027861\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.112.000057\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00293\n10.1093/eurjhf/hfr146\n10.3390/ijms16024226\n10.1016/j.kint.2016.06.012\n10.1152/ajprenal.00394.2015\n10.1007/s00125-005-1705-7\n10.1159/000313363\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.09911.x\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00750.x\n10.3390/ijms17050780\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.06.066\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.01.005\n10.1093/eurheartj/eht515\n10.1155/2014/937398\n10.1097/HJH.0000000000000328\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328341939d\n10.1038/labinvest.2015.93\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.096479\n10.3892/etm.2016.3255\n10.1371/annotation/df98874f-c1bd-4a13-b474-942fbb956287\n10.3892/mmr.2015.4724\n10.1152/ajpheart.00210.2014\n10.2337/db13-1029\n10.25011/cim.v37i3.21384\n10.1186/s12933-017-0546-2\n10.1177/1753944716642677\n10.1007/s10557-015-6592-7\n10.1016/S0008-6363(96)88573-7\n10.1152/ajpcell.00186.2004\n10.1093/cvr/cvn335\n10.1371/journal.pone.0180393\n10.1016/j.vph.2015.07.005\n10.1186/s12933-014-0157-0\n10.2337/db09-0955\n10.1371/journal.pone.0182422\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00677.x\n10.1152/ajprenal.00255.2012\n10.18926/AMO/31684"}

Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), and this nexus represents an attractive target to combat this disease. Naturally occurring flavonoid luteolin exhibits both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in various systems.\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate potential cardioprotective effects of luteolin in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mice with type 1 diabetes.\nC57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce DCM. High glucose (HG) was used to induce H9C2 cells injury in vitro. Cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, inflammation and oxidative stress were studied both in vitro and in vivo.\nOur studies show that luteolin significantly reduces HG-induced inflammatory phenotype and oxidative stress in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. We found that the mechanisms involved inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway and the activation of antioxidant nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. Modulation of these pathways resulted in reduced expression of matrix proteins and cellular hypertrophy. Luteolin also prevented cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and dysfunction in STZ-induced diabetic mice. These readouts were also associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress biomarkers.\nOur results indicate that luteolin protects heart tissues in STZ-induced diabetic mice through modulating Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress and NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses.

Plantamajoside (PMS) is an active component extracted from Herba Plantaginis, which is a traditional Chinese medicine, and many biological activities of PMS have been reported. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism of PMS on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. ISO at 10\u202f\u03bcmol/L was used in vitro to induce H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cell viability and cell surface area were determined by MTT assay and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Furthermore, an in vivo, cardiac hypertrophy model was established by subcutaneous injection of ISO. Pathological alterations and fibrosis in the myocardium were studied by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Myocardial injury-related genes and proteins were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. HDAC2 and its downstream proteins, AKT and GSK3\u03b2, were analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that, in vitro, PMS inhibited the ISO-induced increase in H9c2 cell surface area and the mRNA expression of ANP, BNP and Myh7. In vivo, PMS improved the ISO-induced decrease in cardiac function, inhibited the increase in cardiac anatomical parameters and alleviated the histopathological changes in cardiac tissues. Moreover, PMS inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of ANP, BNP, Myh7, COL1 and COL3. Furthermore, PMS suppressed the activity of HDAC2 and down-regulated the expression of the downstream proteins p-AKT and p-GSK3\u03b2 both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results indicated that PMS exerts significant cardioprotective effects against ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and this protective effect may be mediated by inhibition of the HDAC2 and AKT/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2019-04-23", "authors": ["LinlinShang", "LvPin", "ShanshanZhu", "XiaohangZhong", "YubiaoZhang", "MaoShun", "YunenLiu", "MingxiaoHou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2019.04.024"}

Our preliminary experiment showed that miR-494-3p was increased in heart of diabetic rats, and miR-494-3p was reported to be related to metabolism such as obesity and exercise. Therefore, this study was aimed to explore the role of miR-494-3p in diabetic myocardial insulin sensitivity and the related mechanism. The diabetic rat model was induced by high fat diet (45 kcal% fat, 12 weeks) combined with streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg), and cardiac tissue RNA was extracted for qPCR. The results showed that the level of miR-494-3p was significantly up-regulated in the myocardium of diabetic rats compared with the control (P < 0.05). The level of miR-494-3p in H9c2 cells cultured in high glucose and high fat medium (HGHF) was significantly increased (P < 0.01) with the increase of sodium palmitate concentration, whereas down-regulation of miR-494-3p in HGHF treated cells led to an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (P < 0.01) and the ratio of p-Akt/Akt (P < 0.05). Over-expression of miR-494-3p in H9c2 cell line significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and phosphorylation of Akt (P < 0.01).

{"title": "[Research advances of autonomic nervous system in the regulation of cardiac inflammation].", "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system consists of the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. These two systems control the heart and work in a reciprocal fashion to modulate myocardial energy metabolism, heart rate as well as blood pressure. Multiple cardiac pathological conditions are accompanied by autonomic imbalance, characterized by sympathetic overactivation and parasympathetic inhibition. Studies have shown that overactive sympathetic nervous system leads to increased cardiac inflammatory reaction. Orchestrated inflammatory response serves to clear dead cardiac tissue and activate reparative process, whereas excessive inflammation may result in pathological cardiac remodeling. Since the discovery of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), the protective effects of the parasympathetic nervous system in cardiac inflammation have attracted more attention recently. In this review, we summarized the role and underlying mechanisms of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in cardiac inflammation, in order to provide new insight into cardiac inflammatory response in cardiovascular diseases.", "journal": "Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica]", "date": "2019-04-23", "authors": ["Ye-NanFeng", "HanXiao", "You-YiZhang"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Mast Cells in Cardiac Fibrosis: New Insights Suggest Opportunities for Intervention.", "abstract": "Mast cells (MC) are innate immune cells present in virtually all body tissues with key roles in allergic disease and host defense. MCs recognize damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) through expression of multiple receptors including Toll-like receptors and the IL-33 receptor ST2. MCs can be activated to degranulate and release pre-formed mediators, to synthesize and secrete cytokines and chemokines without degranulation, and/or to produce lipid mediators. MC numbers are generally increased at sites of fibrosis. They are potent, resident, effector cells producing mediators that regulate the fibrotic process. The nature of the secretory products produced by MCs depend on micro-environmental signals and can be both pro- and anti-fibrotic. MCs have been repeatedly implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis and in angiogenic responses in hypoxic tissues, but these findings are controversial. Several rodent studies have indicated a protective role for MCs. MC-deficient mice have been reported to have poorer outcomes after coronary artery ligation and increased cardiac function upon MC reconstitution. In contrast, MCs have also been implicated as key drivers of fibrosis. MC stabilization during a hypertensive rat model and an atrial fibrillation mouse model rescued associated fibrosis. Discrepancies in the literature could be related to problems with mouse models of MC deficiency. To further complicate the issue, mice generally have a much lower density of MCs in their cardiac tissue than humans, and as such comparing MC deficient and MC containing mouse models is not necessarily reflective of the role of MCs in human disease. In this review, we will evaluate the literature regarding the role of MCs in cardiac fibrosis with an emphasis on what is known about MC biology, in this context. MCs have been well-studied in allergic disease and multiple pharmacological tools are available to regulate their function. We will identify potential opportunities to manipulate human MC function and the impact of their mediators with a view to preventing or reducing harmful fibrosis. Important therapeutic opportunities could arise from increased understanding of the impact of such potent, resident immune cells, with the ability to profoundly alter long term fibrotic processes.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2019-04-20", "authors": ["Stephanie ALegere", "Ian DHaidl", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisL\u00e9gar\u00e9", "Jean SMarshall"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2019.00580\n10.1007/978-1-4419-9533-9_2\n10.1111/imr.12629\n10.1111/imr.12625\n10.1016/j.rmed.2011.09.007\n10.7554/eLife.05291\n10.1016/j.virol.2009.01.011\n10.4049/jimmunol.1301794\n10.1097/ALN.0b013e31824bb303\n10.1371/journal.pone.0094732\n10.2147/DDDT.S88337\n10.1016/j.jss.2013.08.021\n10.1038/nri3690\n10.1111/imr.12634\n10.1073/pnas.1410700111\n10.3389/fphar.2013.00174\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1111/imr.12626\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.05.152\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2008.08.009\n10.1016/j.ejcts.2007.09.040\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000385\n10.1002/path.1690\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000074041.81728.79\n10.14814/phy2.13146\n10.1172/JCI39942\n10.1172/JCI39345\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.123158\n10.1097/01.MAT.0000150507.61120.00\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.06.047\n10.1007/s00436-012-2882-1\n10.1152/ajpheart.00806.2004\n10.1111/jcmm.12703\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.01.019\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.03.007\n10.1023/A:1025596404975\n10.1016/j.regpep.2011.08.006\n10.1084/jem.20160081\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62568-0\n10.1067/mai.2000.106777\n10.1046/j.1365-2222.1999.00459.x\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.05.008\n10.1165/rcmb.2013-0399OC\n10.1124/jpet.102.045179\n10.1096/fj.00-0273com\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.03.064\n10.1152/ajplung.2000.278.1.L193\n10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00360.x\n10.1046/j.1365-2222.2002.01293.x\n10.1172/JCI119290\n10.1046/j.1523-1747.2001.15211.x\n10.1007/s11010-007-9676-2\n10.1016/S0167-4838(00)00076-5\n10.1172/JCI20805\n10.1254/jphs.94.443\n10.1038/hr.2012.2\n10.1152/ajpheart.00615.2015\n10.1038/sj.bjp.0707472\n10.1159/000353106\n10.1097/00007890-200106270-00007\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.643585\n10.1007/s10741-010-9180-8\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.01.006\n10.1210/en.2013-2065\n10.1159/000351179\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63241-5\n10.1152/ajpheart.00783.2011\n10.15190/d.2015.33\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.07.011\n10.4049/jimmunol.1103366\n10.1016/j.cellimm.2014.05.005\n10.4049/jimmunol.1001137\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303570\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.027889\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.112185\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.188243\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.199471\n10.1093/cvr/cvu138\n10.1165/rcmb.2004-0175OC\n10.1038/hr.2011.175\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.01.050\n10.1053/j.gastro.2014.01.061\n10.4049/jimmunol.179.4.2051\n10.1186/s13601-015-0076-5\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.04.047\n10.1182/blood-2013-02-483792\n10.1002/eji.201545501\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2051\n10.1371/journal.pone.0143064\n10.1093/cvr/cvs015\n10.1073/pnas.1602039113\n10.1038/nature13989\n10.1084/jem.20140639\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.11.027\n10.1084/jem.20121999\n10.1126/science.aai8132\n10.1016/j.it.2012.09.008\n10.1007/s00418-002-0425-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060827\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.052399\n10.1016/j.molimm.2018.11.009\n10.1038/labinvest.2012.116\n10.4049/jimmunol.1300875\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.04.013\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.1987.tb04087.x\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001711\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.263830\n10.1093/cvr/cvm027\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.180588\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.03.010\n10.1369/jhc.2009.955146\n10.1136/gut.2010.213108\n10.1111/j.1365-2222.1992.tb03102.x\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.1987.tb08972.x\n10.1159/000236122\n10.1183/09031936.06.00078205\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.02.057\n10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.109.873240"}
{"title": "Extended Bidomain Modeling of Defibrillation: Quantifying Virtual Electrode Strengths in Fibrotic Myocardium.", "abstract": "Defibrillation is a well-established therapy for atrial and ventricular arrhythmia. Here, we shed light on defibrillation in the fibrotic heart. Using the extended bidomain model of electrical conduction in cardiac tissue, we assessed the influence of fibrosis on the strength of virtual electrodes caused by extracellular electrical current. We created one-dimensional models of rabbit ventricular tissue with a central patch of fibrosis. The fibrosis was incorporated by altering volume fractions for extracellular, myocyte and fibroblast domains. In our prior work, we calculated these volume fractions from microscopic images at the infarct border zone of rabbit hearts. An average and a large degree of fibrosis were modeled. We simulated defibrillation by application of an extracellular current for a short duration (5 ms). We explored the effects of myocyte-fibroblast coupling, intra-fibroblast conductivity and patch length on the strength of the virtual electrodes present at the borders of the normal and fibrotic tissue. We discriminated between effects on myocyte and fibroblast membranes at both borders of the patch. Similarly, we studied defibrillation in two-dimensional models of fibrotic tissue. Square and disk-like patches of fibrotic tissue were embedded in control tissue. We quantified the influence of the geometry and fibrosis composition on virtual electrode strength. We compared the results obtained with a square and disk shape of the fibrotic patch with results from the one-dimensional simulations. Both, one- and two-dimensional simulations indicate that extracellular current application causes virtual electrodes at boundaries of fibrotic patches. A higher degree of fibrosis and larger patch size were associated with an increased strength of the virtual electrodes. Also, patch geometry affected the strength of the virtual electrodes. Our simulations suggest that increased fibroblast-myocyte coupling and intra-fibroblast conductivity reduce virtual electrode strength. However, experimental data to constrain these modeling parameters are limited and thus pinpointing the magnitude of the reduction will require further understanding of electrical coupling of fibroblasts in native cardiac tissues. We propose that the findings from our computational studies are important for development of patient-specific protocols for internal defibrillators.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2019-04-20", "authors": ["JeanBragard", "Aparna CSankarankutty", "Frank BSachse"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2019.00337\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000549\n10.1515/bmt-2013-4333.\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.118106\n10.1093/europace/eup091\n10.1371/journal.pone.0173324\n10.3389/fbioe.2017.00018\n10.1039/c2ib00100d\n10.1109/TBME.2013.2292320\n10.1146/annurev-bioeng-070909-105305\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1998.tb00135.x\n10.1109/10.748979\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1998.tb00926.x\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.1998.tb00107.x\n10.1098/rsta.2008.0094\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00239\n10.1007/s13239-016-0266-x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.06.062\n10.1093/europace/eum207\n10.1161/01.RES.71.1.127\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.024\n10.1113/expphysiol.1994.sp003819\n10.1529/biophysj.106.98160\n10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2012.08.005\n10.1006/jtbi.1999.0957\n10.1007/BF01868475\n10.1007/BF00585633\n10.1152/ajpcell.1992.263.5.C959\n10.1007/b96841\n10.1007/s10439-007-9405-8\n10.1007/s10439-009-9667-4\n10.1007/978-3-642-12110-4_55\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2017.07.006\n10.1529/biophysj.104.054429\n10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78173-6\n10.1109/TBME.1972.324138\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.11.020"}

Here we use genetic knock out model to delineate lipidomic, and metabolic changes to describe the role of lipoxygenase in advancing ischemic HF driven by leukocyte activation with signs of non-resolving inflammation. Bioactive lipids and metabolites are implicated in acute and chronic HF, and the goal of this study was to define the role of lipoxygenase in temporal kinetics of lipidomic and metabolic reprogramming in HF.\nTo address this question, we used a permanent coronary ligation mouse model which showed profound metabolic and lipidomic reprogramming in acute HF.

{"title": "Inhibition of aldose reductase activity stimulates starvation induced autophagy and clears aldehyde protein adducts.", "abstract": "Autophagy is a dynamic recycling process that eliminates damaged proteins and cellular organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Aldose reductase (AR) catalyzes conversion of glucose to sorbitol. It also catalyzes the reduction of a broad array of saturated and unsaturated aldehydes. Recently we demonstrated that deletion of AR promotes pathological cardiac remodeling via excessive autophagy; however, the role of AR in starvation-induced autophagy has not been determined. To determine the role of AR in starvation-induced autophagy, WTC57/Bl6 mice were pretreated with the AR inhibitor sorbinil (0.2\u202fg/L for 48\u202fh) in drinking water, followed by 24\u202fh fasting. We found that the sorbinil pretreatment in fed mice did not affect blood glucose levels, whereas, it decreased the blood glucose levels in fasting mice. In comparison with fed mice, the LC3II formation and LCII/LCI ratio were increased in the fasted mice hearts and sorbinil pretreatment further enhanced LC3II formation and LC3II/LC3I ratios in these hearts. Fasting-induced autophagy coincided with AMPK activation in the sorbinil pretreated fasted mice hearts. Autophagy and activation of AMPK was also induced in the gastrocnemius skeletal muscle of sorbinil pre-treated fasted mice. Induction of autophagy in the cardiac tissues of sorbinil pretreated fasted mice was accompanied by increased clearance of 4-hydroxytrans-2-nonenal-protein adducts. Taken together, these results indicate that the inhibition of AR during fasting activates autophagic response, increases clearance of aldehyde-protein adducts, which could serve as a mechanism to maintain cellular homeostasis during starvation.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2019-04-19", "authors": ["DeqingZhang", "AruniBhatnagar", "Shahid PBaba"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2019.04.014"}

{"title": "The effects of parathyroid hormone-related peptide on cardiac angiogenesis, apoptosis, and function in mice with myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "It is known that parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS, 87-107), which, together with its C-terminus (107-139), has been shown to positively regulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) proliferation and vascular neointima formation, and inhibit cellular apoptosis. The role of PTHrP in ischemic cardiac diseases remains unclear. In this study, we attempted to determine whether PTHrP 87 to 139 can play a role in promoting cardiac function via enhancing angiogenesis after myocardial infarction (MI) occurred. MI was reproduced in C57BL/6 mice using a coronary artery ligation method. In total, three groups (n = 11 per group) of animals were used, and they were received either PTHrP 87 to 139 (80 \u00b5g/kg, treatment group) or saline (MI and Sham group) subcutaneously once a day for 4 weeks after MI. To measure cardiac function, an echocardiography was generated and cardiac tissue was harvested for immunohistological studies 4 weeks after operation. Our results show that, after MI, the cardiac function of the experimental mice was significantly impaired. PTHrP 87 to 139 treatment attenuated cardiac dysfunction in MI mice. Besides, as indicated by decreased heart weight/body weight and lung weight/body weight ratio, PTHrP 87 to 139 attenuated pulmonary congestion and cardiac hypertrophy. Masson staining revealed that PTHrP 87 to 139 attenuated myocardial fibrosis after MI. Also, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining and the expression of cleaved caspase 3 suggested that MI-induced myocytes apotosis was inhibited by PTHrP 87 to 139. In addition to the significantly increased capillary density, PTHrP 87 to 139 treatment also induced p-Akt and several angiogenic factors. In conclusion, PTHrP 87 to 139 treatment preserved cardiac function after MI, and stimulated angiogenesis via upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in infarct border zone of ischemic myocardium,.

{"title": "Three-dimensional microengineered models of human cardiac diseases.", "abstract": "In vitro three-dimensional (3D) microengineered tissue models have been the recent focus of pathophysiological studies, particularly in the field of cardiovascular research. These models, as classified by 3D biomimetic tissues within micrometer-scale platforms, enable precise environmental control on the molecular- and cellular-levels to elucidate biological mechanisms of disease progression and enhance efficacy of therapeutic research. Microengineered models also incorporate directed stem cell differentiation and genome modification techniques that warrant derivation of patient-specific and genetically-edited human cardiac cells for precise recapitulation of diseased tissues. Additionally, integration of added functionalities and/or structures into these models serves to enhance the capability to further extract disease-specific phenotypic, genotypic, and electrophysiological information.

{"title": "Electrically-Induced Ventricular Fibrillation Alters Cardiovascular Function and Expression of Apoptotic and Autophagic Proteins in Rat Hearts.", "abstract": "The pathological heart contractions, called arrhythmias, especially ventricular fibrillation (VF), are a prominent feature of many cardiovascular diseases leading to sudden cardiac death. The present investigation evaluates the effect of electrically stimulated VF on cardiac functions related to autophagy and apoptotic mechanisms in isolated working rat hearts.\nEach group of hearts was subjected to 0 (Control), 1, 3, or 10 min of spacing-induced VF, followed by 120 min of recovery period and evaluated for cardiac functions, including aortic flow (AF), coronary flow (CF), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and heart rate (HR). Hearts were also evaluated for VF effects on infarcted zone magnitude and Western blot analysis was conducted on heart tissue for expression of the apoptotic biomarker cleaved-caspase-3 and the autophagy proteins: p62, P-mTOR/mTOR, LC3BII/LC3BI ratio, and Atg5-12 complexes.\nData revealed that VF induced degradation in AF, CF, CO, and SV, which prominently included-variable post-VF capacity for recovery of normal heart rhythm; increased extent of infarcted heart tissue; altered expression of cleaved-caspase-3 suggesting potential for VF-mediated amplification of apoptosis. VF influence on expression of p62, LC3BII/LC3BI, and Atg5-12 proteins was complex, possibly due to differential effects of VF-induced expression on proteins comprising the autophagic program.\nVF was observed to cause time-dependent changes in autophagy processes, which with additional analysis under ongoing investigations, likely to yield novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of VF and sudden cardiac death.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2019-04-17", "authors": ["AndrasCzegledi", "AgnesTosaki", "AlexandraGyongyosi", "RitaZilinyi", "ArpadTosaki", "IstvanLekli"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms20071628\n10.3109/10715769009145674\n10.1016/S0008-6363(95)00217-0\n10.1016/0022-2828(89)90828-6\n10.1161/01.RES.65.1.146\n10.1161/01.CIR.80.5.1115\n10.1161/01.RES.55.4.545\n10.1161/01.RES.58.3.331\n10.1073/pnas.88.11.4680\n10.1016/0002-9149(91)90538-V\n10.1097/00005344-200001000-00005\n10.1016/0891-5849(93)90085-9\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.09.004\n10.1111/anec.12495\n10.1161/01.CIR.91.1.37\n10.1161/01.CIR.82.6.2044\n10.1016/S0022-2828(87)80396-6\n10.1093/cvr/22.11.818\n10.1006/jmcc.1993.1081\n10.1007/s00059-003-2467-y\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.8.795\n10.1139/Y10-082\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00921.x\n10.1634/stemcells.18-6-457\n10.1023/A:1024121017841\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80748-5\n10.1097/FJC.0000000000000132\n10.1016/j.phrs.2015.07.021\n10.1074/jbc.M501707200\n10.1111/jcmm.12074\n10.1111/jcmm.13053\n10.2174/138161281939131127122510\n10.1038/ncb0310-207\n10.1038/nrm3696\n10.1080/15548627.2015.1100356\n10.1586/14789450.2014.939635\n10.1155/2015/727401"}

{"title": "Using miRNAs and circRNAs to estimate PMI in advanced stage.", "abstract": "In our previous study, we evaluated the stability of multi-RNA markers in heart, liver and skeletal muscle tissues of mice within 8\u202fdays after death and concluded that microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular (circRNAs) were more stable as reference genes in dead bodies than other kinds of RNAs. Based on their tissue-specific expression, we obtained reference genes for three kinds of tissues: miR-122, miR-133a and 18S in heart tissues; LC-Ogdh, circ-AFF1 and miR-122 in liver tissues; and miR-133a, circ-AFF1 in skeletal muscle tissues. For the estimation of post mortem interval (PMI), we also selected suitable biomarkers, which exhibited the best correlation coefficient with PMI. In our stability analysis of multi-RNA markers, Gapdh, Rps18, U6 and \u03b2-actin were unstable and selected as candidate target biomarkers. By analyzing the correlation between the expression levels of candidate target biomarkers and PMI, we obtained suitable target biomarkers for the three kinds of tissues, respectively. Finally, we established mathematical models of PMI estimation using the above selected reference genes and target biomarkers. The low estimated error in the validated samples demonstrated that PMI in advanced stage could be accurately predicted by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) through systematically selected effective reference genes and target biomarkers. Besides, combining the estimated results of various tissues and multi-biomarkers could improve the accuracy of PMI estimation.", "journal": "Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)", "date": "2019-04-16", "authors": ["ChunyanTu", "TieshuaiDu", "XingYe", "ChengchenShao", "JianhuiXie", "YiwenShen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.legalmed.2019.04.002"}
{"title": "Decellularized extracellular matrix bioinks and the external stimuli to enhance cardiac tissue development in vitro.", "abstract": "Engineered heart tissue (EHT) has ample potential as a model for in vitro tissue modeling or tissue regeneration. Using 3D cell printing technology, various hydrogels have been utilized as bioinks to fabricate EHT to date. However, its efficacy has remained limited due to poor functional properties of the cultured cardiomyocytes stemming from a lack of proper microenvironmental cues. Specifically, the surrounding matrix plays a key role in modulating cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation. Recently, the use of heart tissue-derived extracellular matrix (hdECM) bioink has come to be seen as one of the most promising candidates due to its functional and structural similarities to native tissue. Here, we demonstrated a correlation between the synthesis of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins and the surrounding microenvironment irrespective of the similar material chemistry. Primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal rats were encapsulated in different composition and concentration of bioinks (hdECM and collagen). The bioinks were sequentially printed using an extrusion-based 3D bioprinter and cultured either statically or dynamically. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation revealed enhanced maturation of cardiomyocytes in hdECM, unlike the collagen group under similar culture conditions. Specifically, 3D-printed EHT using a low concentration of hdECM promoted early differentiation of cardiomyocytes. Hence, the present study provides experimental insights regarding the establishment of a 3D-printed cardiac tissue model, highlighting that the matrix and the culture microenvironment can be decisive factors for cell-material interactions that affect cardiomyocyte maturation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The regulation of signal transduction and responses to extracellular matrices (ECMs) is of particular relevance in tissue maturation. In particular, there is a clear need to understand the structural and phenotypical modulation in cardiomyocytes with respect to the surrounding microenvironment. Exploration of the key regulators, such as the compositional and the biophysical properties of bioinks associated directly with cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions would assist with the fabrication of cardiac tissue constructs with enhanced functionality. Hence, we documented the synergistic effects of surrounding matrices and culture conditions on the maturation of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we highlighted the potential of using 3D bioprinting techniques to fabricate uniformly aligned cardiac constructs for mid- to high-throughput drug testing platforms that have great reproducibility and versatility.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2019-04-16", "authors": ["SanskritaDas", "Seok-WonKim", "Yeong-JinChoi", "SooyeonLee", "Se-HwanLee", "Jeong-SikKong", "Hun-JunPark", "Dong-WooCho", "JinahJang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2019.04.026"}

{"title": "Inflammatory cytokines associated with cancer growth induce mitochondria and cytoskeleton alterations in cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction is often observed in patients with cancer also representing a serious problem limiting chemotherapeutic intervention and even patient survival. In view of the recently established role of the immune system in the control of cancer growth, the present work has been undertaken to investigate the effects of a panel of the most important inflammatory cytokines on the integrity and function of mitochondria, as well as of the cytoskeleton, two key elements in the functioning of cardiomyocytes. Either mitochondria features or actomyosin cytoskeleton organization of in vitro-cultured cardiomyocytes treated with different inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. In addition, to investigate the interplay between tumor growth and cardiac function in an in vivo system, immunocompetent female mice were inoculated with cancer cells and treated with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin at a dosing schedule able to suppress tumor growth without inducing cardiac alterations.

The junctional membrane complexes in the cardiac dyads, where transverse (T) tubules are juxtaposed to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, are a prime example. T-tubule uncoupling and remodeling are well-known features of cardiac disease and heart failure. Even subtle alterations in the association between T-tubules and the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum can cause serious cardiac disorders. NEXN (nexilin) has been identified as an actin-binding protein, and multiple mutations in the NEXN gene are associated with cardiac diseases, but the precise role of NEXN in heart function and disease is still unknown.\nNexn global and cardiomyocyte-specific knockout mice were generated. Comprehensive phenotypic and RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses were performed. Heart tissue samples and isolated single cardiomyocytes were analyzed by electron and confocal microscopy.\nGlobal and cardiomyocyte-specific loss of Nexn in mice resulted in a rapidly progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that NEXN interacted with junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, was essential for optimal calcium transients, and was required for initiation of T-tubule invagination and formation.\nThese results demonstrated that NEXN is a pivotal component of the junctional membrane complex and is required for initiation and formation of T-tubules, thus providing insight into mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy in patients with mutations in NEXN.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2019-04-16", "authors": ["CanzhaoLiu", "SimoneSpinozzi", "Jia-YuChen", "XiFang", "WeiFeng", "GuyPerkins", "PaolaCattaneo", "NunoGuimar\u00e3es-Camboa", "Nancy DDalton", "Kirk LPeterson", "TongbinWu", "KunfuOuyang", "Xiang-DongFu", "Sylvia MEvans", "JuChen"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.039751"}

To resemble a more adult-like phenotype on these heart-on-a-chip systems, the surrounding micro-environment of individual cardiomyocyte needs to be controlled. Herein, we investigated the impact of four microenvironmental cues: cell seeding density, types and percentages of non-myocyte populations, the types of hydrogels used for tissue inoculation and the electrical conditioning regimes on the structural and functional assembly of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues. Utilizing a novel, plastic and open-access heart-on-a-chip system that is capable of continuous non-invasive monitoring of tissue contractions, we were able to study how different micro-environmental cues affect the assembly of the cardiomyocytes into a functional cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Microstructure-based finite element model of left ventricle passive inflation.", "abstract": "Isolating the role(s) of microstructural pathological features in affecting diastolic filling is important in developing targeted treatments for heart diseases. We developed a microstructure-based constitutive model of the myocardium and implemented it in an efficient open-source finite element modeling framework to simulate passive inflation of the left ventricle (LV) in a representative 3D geometry based on experimentally measured muscle fiber architecture. The constitutive model was calibrated using previous tissue-level biaxial mechanical test data derived from the canine heart and validated with independent sets of measurements made at both the isolated constituent and organ level. Using the validated model, we investigated the load taken up by each tissue constituent and their effects on LV passive inflation. The model predicts that the LV compliance is sensitive to the collagen ultrastructure, specifically, the collagen fiber azimuthal angle with respect to the local muscle fiber direction and its waviness. The model also predicts that most of the load in the sub-epicardial and sub-endocardial regions is taken up, respectively, by the muscle fibers and collagen fiber network. This result suggests that normalizing LV passive stiffness by altering the collagen fiber network and myocyte stiffness is most effective when applied to the sub-endocardial and sub-epicardial regions, respectively. This finding may have implication for the development of new pharmaceutical treatments targeting individual cardiac tissue constituents to normalize LV filling function in heart diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Current constitutive models describing the tissue mechanical behavior of the myocardium are largely phenomenological. While able to represent the bulk tissue mechanical behavior, these models cannot distinguish the contribution of the tissue constituents and their ultrastructure to heart function. Although microstructure-based constitutive models can be used to isolate the role of tissue ultrastructure, they have not been implemented in a computational framework that can accommodate realistic 3D organ geometry. The present study addresses these issues by developing and validating a microstructure-based computational modeling framework, which is used to investigate the role of tissue constituents and their ultrastructure in affecting heart function.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2019-04-14", "authors": ["CeXi", "Ghassan SKassab", "Lik ChuanLee"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2019.04.016"}

In experiments, 64 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into eight groups ( n = 8). These groups were control (C) (0.9% saline solution), DOX (20 mg/kg DOX), LIN50 (50 mg/kg LIN), LIN100 (100 mg/kg LIN), DOX + LIN50 (20 mg/kg DOX and 50 mg/kg LIN), DOX + LIN100 (20 mg/kg DOX and 100 mg/kg LIN), LIN50 + DOX (50 mg/kg LIN and 20 mg/kg DOX), and LIN100 + DOX (100 mg/kg LIN and 20 mg/kg DOX). It was determined that necrosis and extensive inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the DOX group. It was determined that histopathological changes significantly decreased in groups treated with LIN after DOX administration. While the caspase-3 immunostaining was highly evident in DOX group apoptotic cells ( p < 0.001, for all), the intensity of caspase-3 immunostaining in the treatment groups decreased ( p < 0.05). While DOX administration resulted in a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and plasma Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in cardiac tissue when compared to the C groups, it was observed that DOX + LIN administration led to a significant decrease in MDA, plasma CK and LDH levels and a significant increase in glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase, and catalase enzyme levels.

Exposure of albino mice to these repellents for 3\u202fh per day over a period of 20\u202fdays produced significant toxicological effects on vital body organs including; liver, lungs, kidneys, brain and heart. The order of toxicity of different repellents on nervous and hepatic tissues was found to be: Coil\u202f>\u202fLiquid\u202f>\u202fMat while in renal and cardiac tissues, the coil was again found to be the most toxic one, mat with medium toxicity whereas liquid as least toxic (Coil\u202f>\u202fMat\u202f>\u202fliquid).

Myocardin (MYOCD), a cardiac-specific co-activator of serum response factor (SRF), is increased in DCM porcine and patient cardiac tissues and plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DCM. Inhibiting the increased MYOCD has shown to be partially rescuing the DCM phenotype in porcine model. However, expression levels of MYOCD in the cardiac tissues of the cardiorenal syndromic patients and the effect of inhibiting MYOCD in a cardiorenal syndrome model remains to be explored. Here, we analyzed the expression levels of MYOCD in the DCM patients with and without renal diseases. We also explored, whether cardiac specific silencing of MYOCD expression could ameliorate the cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac function in a renal artery ligated rat model (RAL). We observed an increase in MYOCD levels in the endomyocardial biopsies of DCM patients associated with renal failure compared to DCM alone. Silencing of MYOCD in RAL rats by a cardiac homing peptide conjugated MYOCD siRNA resulted in attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and restoration of the left ventricular functions.

Despite the widespread use of electroconductive biomaterials to increase the physiological relevance of bioengineered cardiac tissues in vitro, there are still several limitations associated with engineering biocompatible scaffolds with appropriate mechanical properties and electroconductivity for cardiac tissue regeneration. Here, we introduce highly adhesive fibrous scaffolds engineered by electrospinning of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) followed by the conjugation of a choline-based bio-ionic liquid (Bio-IL) to develop conductive and adhesive cardiopatches. These GelMA/Bio-IL adhesive patches were optimized to exhibit mechanical and conductive properties similar to the native myocardium. Furthermore, the engineered patches strongly adhered to murine myocardium due to the formation of ionic bonding between the Bio-IL and native tissue, eliminating the need for suturing. Co-cultures of primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts grown on GelMA/Bio-IL patches exhibited comparatively better contractile profiles compared to pristine GelMA controls, as demonstrated by over-expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43.

However, the mechanisms underlying cardiac fluorosis have not been illuminated in detail. We performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on rat cardiac tissue to explore the molecular effects of NaF exposure. In total, 372 and 254 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between a group given 30 mg/L NaF and control and between a group given 90 mg/L NaF and control, respectively. The transcript levels of most of these genes were significantly down-regulated and many were distributed in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Transcriptome analysis revealed that herpes simplex infection, ECM-receptor interaction, influenza A, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, apoptosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were significantly affected. IL-6 and IL-10 may play a crucial role in the cardiac damage caused by NaF as external stimuli according to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed a marked decreased mRNA and protein levels of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 in the low concentration fluoride (LF) and high concentration fluoride (HF) groups, which was in agreement with RNA-Seq results.

Cardiomyocytes retain some proliferative capacity in the neonates but lose it in adulthood. Consequently, a number of signaling hubs including microRNAs are altered during cardiac development that adversely impacts regenerative potential of cardiac tissue. Embryonic stem cell cycle miRs are a class of microRNAs exclusively expressed during developmental stages; however, their effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart function in adult myocardium has not been studied previously.\nTo determine whether transient reintroduction of embryonic stem cell cycle miR-294 promotes cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry enhancing cardiac repair after myocardial injury.\nmiR-294 is expressed in the heart during development, prenatal stages, lost in the neonate, and adult heart confirmed by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Neonatal ventricular myocytes treated with miR-294 showed elevated expression of Ki67, p-histone H3, and Aurora B confirmed by immunocytochemistry compared with control cells. miR-294 enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in Neonatal ventricular myocytes measured by seahorse assay. Mechanistically, miR-294 represses Wee1 leading to increased activity of the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Next, a doxycycline-inducible AAV9-miR-294 vector was delivered to mice for activating miR-294 in myocytes for 14 days continuously after myocardial infarction. miR-294-treated mice significantly improved left ventricular functions together with decreased infarct size and apoptosis 8 weeks after MI.

The aim of our present work was to investigate changes in the cardiac metabolome following relaxin-2 treatment.\nSprague-Dawley rats were treated with human recombinant relaxin-2 using osmotic minipumps at a dose of 0.4\u2009mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Body composition was measured with a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system seven days after surgery and on the final day of the experiment. The last two days of treatment, respiratory quotient, locomotor activity and energy expenditure were measured with a calorimetric system. The plasma levels of relaxin-2, total cholesterol, high- and low- density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL), triglycerides and the hepatic enzymes glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GTP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were analyzed. The metabolic profiling of both atria from relaxin-2-treated and control rats was carried out using two separate ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Time of Flight-MS based platforms analyzing methanol and chloroform/methanol extracts combined with a UHPLC-single quadrupole-MS based platform used to analyze aminoacids and with a methanol/water extract platform that covered polar metabolites. Identified ion features in the methanol extract platform included fatty acids, acyl carnitines, bile acids, monoacylglycerophospholipids, monoetherglycerophospholipids, free sphingoid bases, and oxidized fatty acids. The chloroform / methanol extract platform provided coverage over glycerolipids, cholesterol esters, sphingolipids, diacylglycerophospholipids, and acyl-ether-glycerophospholipids. Gene expression levels of the adipokines adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1 in visceral adipose tissue and cardiac gene expression levels of key enzymes of desaturation and elongation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs were assessed by Real Time-PCR.\nTwenty-eight metabolites out of three hundred sixty-two were significantly altered by human relaxin-2. These included fifteen glycerophospholipids: three phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and twelve phosphatidylcholines (PC); eight sphingolipids: three ceramides (Cer) and five sphingomyelins (SM); and also five aminoacids and one carboxylic acid. Interestingly, the majority of changes correspond to lipid classes, twelve of them polyunsaturated diacylglycerophosphatidylcholines with long acyl chains, containing mainly docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) and arachidonic acid (20:4). Atrial levels of Elovl5 (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5), Fads1 (\u03945-fatty acid desaturase) and Fads2 (\u03946-fatty acid desaturase), key enzymes of elongation and desaturation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs like arachidonic acid and DHA, respectively, were significantly increased by relaxin-2 treatment. Atrial tissues from rats treated with relaxin-2 showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of Srebf1, a transcription factor that activates the gene expression of Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2. The treatment with relaxin-2 significantly decreased the visceral fat mRNA expression levels of adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1, adipokines known to exert an important influence on the regulation of cardiovascular function.\nSerelaxin (human recombinant relaxin-2) treatment induces significant changes in cardiac major components of the membrane lipid bilayer such as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, known to have structural roles but also very relevant regulatory effects in cardiac function.

Overall global cardiac parameters (such as ejection fraction, cardiac output and volumes) were improved similarly between both training modalities. At tissue level, collagen content was significantly and similarly reduced in both exercise groups. Finally, only HIIT increased significantly capillary density. Our data indicate that even if very different in design, HIIT and MIT appear to be equally effective in improving cardiac function in healthy rats. Furthermore, HIIT provides additional benefits through improved capillary density and should therefore be considered as a preferred training modality for athletes and for patients.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2019-04-06", "authors": ["MaximVerboven", "AnneCuypers", "DorienDeluyker", "IvoLambrichts", "Bert OEijnde", "DominiqueHansen", "VirginieBito"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-42023-1\n10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303461\n10.1007/s00125-015-3741-2\n10.3305/nh.2015.31.sup3.8771\n10.1249/MSS.0000000000000640\n10.2174/1573403X10666140404110229\n10.1371/journal.pone.0114205\n10.1136/hrt.2009.165571\n10.4330/wjc.v7.i2.52\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192521\n10.3389/fphys.2017.00562\n10.1136/bjsports-2013-092576\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.675041\n10.1152/japplphysiol.00499.2015\n10.1007/s40279-015-0365-0\n10.1258/smj.2011.011284\n10.1152/ajpheart.00647.2014\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60749-6\n10.1139/y98-094\n10.1007/s11892-017-0927-7\n10.1152/jappl.1999.87.3.1186\n10.1172/JCI110729\n10.1016/S0002-9149(99)00264-7\n10.1016/j.lfs.2015.01.007\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.04.005\n10.2337/db12-1580\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.03.010\n10.1186/cc6975\n10.1152/ajpcell.1993.264.5.C1180\n10.1093/cvr/cvn332\n10.1519/JSC.0b013e31816354b1\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000129308.04757.72\n10.1097/HJR.0b013e3280128bef\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp084\n10.1253/circj.72.378\n10.1371/journal.pone.0102969\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.02.095\n10.1038/s41598-017-16255-y\n10.1038/nm1175\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.03.094\n10.1172/JCI32024\n10.1172/JCI34126\n10.1113/EP086416\n10.1093/cvr/cvw182\n10.1152/ajpheart.00751.2015\n10.3389/fcvm.2018.00066\n10.1016/j.ahj.2006.11.004\n10.1016/j.nut.2015.02.005\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.03.016\n10.1016/0300-9629(93)90513-4\n10.1152/ajpheart.00945.2015"}

The lipophilic drug, probucol, has shown significant \u03b2-cell protective and potential antidiabetic effects, which were enhanced by hydrophilic bile acid incorporation using taurocholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. However, probucol has severe cardiotoxicity and a variable absorption profile, which limit its potential applications in T2D. Accordingly, this study aimed to design multiple formulations to optimise probucol oral delivery in T2D and test their effects on probucol absorption and accumulation in the heart. Adult male mice were given a high fat diet (HFD), and a week later, injected with a single dose of alloxan to accelerate T2D development, and once diabetes confirmed, divided into three groups (six to seven mice each). The groups were gavaged a daily dose of probucol powder, probucol microcapsules, or probucol-bile acid microcapsules for three months, and euthanized; and blood, tissues, and feces collected for blood glucose and probucol concentration analyses. Probucol concentrations in plasma were similar among all the groups. Groups given probucol microcapsules and probucol-bile acid microcapsules showed significant reduction in probucol accumulation in the heart compared with the group given probucol powder (p<0.05).

{"title": "A small intergenic region of lp17 is required for evasion of adaptive immunity and induction of pathology by the Lyme disease spirochete.", "abstract": "The causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, harbours a single linear chromosome and upwards of 23 linear and circular plasmids. Only a minority of these plasmids, including linear plasmid 17, are maintained with near-absolute fidelity during extended in vitro passage, and characterisation of any putative virulence determinants they encode has only recently begun. In this work, a mutant lacking a ~4.7\u00a0kb fragment of lp17 was studied. Colonisation of murine tissues by this lp17 mutant was significantly impaired, as was the ability to induce carditis and arthritis. The deficiency in tissue colonisation was alleviated in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, implicating a role for this plasmid region in adaptive immune evasion. Through genetic complementation, the mutant phenotype could be fully attributed to a 317\u00a0bp intergenic region that corresponds to the discontinued bbd07 ORF and upstream sequence. The intergenic region was found to be transcriptionally active, and mutant spirochetes lacking this region exhibited an overall difference in the antigenic profile during infection of an immunocompetent murine host.

{"title": "On the AIC-based model reduction for the general Holzapfel-Ogden myocardial constitutive law.", "abstract": "Constitutive laws that describe the mechanical responses of cardiac tissue under loading hold the key to accurately model the biomechanical behaviour of the heart. There have been ample choices of phenomenological constitutive laws derived from experiments, some of which are quite sophisticated and include effects of microscopic fibre structures of the myocardium. A typical example is the strain-invariant-based Holzapfel-Ogden 2009 model that is excellently fitted to simple shear tests. It has been widely used and regarded as the state-of-the-art constitutive law for myocardium. However, there has been no analysis to show if it has both adequate descriptive and predictive capabilities for other tissue tests of myocardium. Indeed, such an analysis is important for any constitutive laws for clinically useful computational simulations. In this work, we perform such an analysis using combinations of tissue tests, uniaxial tension, biaxial tension and simple shear from three different sets of myocardial tissue studies. Starting from the general 14-parameter myocardial constitutive law developed by Holzapfel and Ogden, denoted as the general HO model, we show that this model has good descriptive and predictive capabilities for all the experimental tests. However, to reliably determine all 14 parameters of the model from experiments remains a great challenge. Our aim is to reduce the constitutive law using Akaike information criterion, to maintain its mechanical integrity whilst achieving minimal computational cost. A competent constitutive law should have descriptive and predictive capabilities for different tissue tests. By competent, we mean the model has least terms but is still able to describe and predict experimental data. We also investigate the optimal combinations of tissue tests\u00a0for a given constitutive model. For example, our results show that\u00a0using one of the reduced HO models, one may\u00a0need just one shear response (along normal-fibre\u00a0direction) and one biaxial stretch (ratio of 1 mean fibre : 1 cross-fibre) to satisfactorily describe Sommer et al. human myocardial mechanical properties. Our study\u00a0suggests that single-state tests (i.e. simple shear or stretching only) are insufficient to determine the myocardium responses. We also found\u00a0it is important to consider transmural fibre rotations within each\u00a0myocardial sample\u00a0of tests during the fitting process.\u00a0This is done by\u00a0excluding un-stretched fibres using\u00a0an \"effective fibre ratio\", which depends on the sample size, shape, local myofibre architecture and loading conditions.

A rat model of HF was induced in\u00a0vivo by intraperitoneally administering ISO (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 7\u00a0days. After 4\u00a0weeks following establishment of the HF model, hemodynamic analysis demonstrated that ISO induced a significant increase in the left ventricular end\u2011diastolic pressure and a decrease in the left ventricular systolic pressure and maximum contraction velocity. The plasma levels of myocardial injury markers, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), CK\u2011muscle/brain which were determined using the corresponding assay kits and plasma brain natriuretic peptide which was detected by an ELISA kit, an important biomarker of HF, increased following ISO treatment. Furthermore, levels of GDF11 expression and protein, which were estimated using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an ELISA kit in plasma and western blotting in the heart tissue, respectively, significantly increased following ISO treatment. To demonstrate the effects of ISO on GDF11 production in cardiomyocytes, H9C2 cells (a cardiomyoblast cell line derived from embryonic rat heart tissue) were treated with ISO (50\u00a0nM) for 24\u00a0h in\u00a0vitro; it was revealed that GDF11 protein and mRNA expression levels significantly increased following ISO treatment.

{"title": "Dynamics of the Ghrelin/Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor System in the Human Heart Before and After Cardiac Transplantation.", "abstract": "Currently, the early preclinical detection of left ventricular dysfunction is difficult because biomarkers are not specific for the cardiomyopathic process. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to heart failure remain elusive, highlighting the need for identification of cardiac-specific markers. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and its ligand ghrelin are present in cardiac tissue and are known to contribute to myocardial energetics. Here, we examined tissue ghrelin-GHSR levels as specific markers of cardiac dysfunction in patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. Samples of cardiac tissue were obtained from 10 patients undergoing cardiac transplant at the time of organ harvesting and during serial posttransplant biopsies. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy using a fluorescent ghrelin analog was used to measure levels of GHSR, and immunofluorescence was used to measure levels of ghrelin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and tissue markers of cardiomyocyte contractility and growth. GHSR and ghrelin expression levels were highly variable in the explanted heart, less in the grafted heart biopsies. GHSR and ghrelin were strongly positively correlated, and both markers were negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction. Ghrelin had stronger positive correlations than BNP with the signaling markers for contractility and growth. These data suggest that GHSR-ghrelin have potential use as an integrated marker of cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, tissue ghrelin appeared to be a more sensitive indicator than BNP to the biochemical processes that are characteristic of heart failure. This work allows for further use of ghrelin-GHSR to interrogate cardiac-specific biochemical mechanisms in preclinical stages of heart failure (HF).", "journal": "Journal of the Endocrine Society", "date": "2019-04-03", "authors": ["RebeccaSullivan", "Varinder KRandhawa", "AnneStokes", "DerekWu", "TylerLalonde", "BobKiaii", "LeonardLuyt", "GeraldWisenberg", "SavitaDhanvantari"], "doi": "10.1210/js.2018-00393\n10.1056/NEJMra0800239"}

{"title": "Dissecting hiPSC-CM pacemaker function in a cardiac organoid model.", "abstract": "Biological pacemakers could be a promising alternative to electronic pacemakers and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) may represent a suitable source for implantable cells. To further unravel this potential a thorough understanding of pacemaker function with regard to coupling processes both in the physiological and in the graft-host context is required. Here we developed a 2-component cardiac organoid model with a hiPSC-CM embryoid body (EB) as trigger casted into a rat engineered heart tissue (EHT) as arrhythmic beating substrate. Contractility recordings revealed that the EB controlled the beating activity of the EHT, leading to a regular hiPSC-CM-like beating pattern instead of the irregular beating typically seen in rat EHT. Connectivity was observed with action potential (AP) measurements and calcium transients transmitting from the EB directly into the rat EHT.

{"title": "Implantation of hiPSC-derived Cardiac-muscle Patches after Myocardial Injury in a Guinea Pig Model.", "abstract": "Due to the limited regeneration capacity of the heart in adult mammals, myocardial infarction results in an irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes. This loss of relevant amounts of heart muscle mass can lead to the heart failure. Besides heart transplantation, there is no curative treatment option for the end-stage heart failure. In times of organ donor shortage, organ independent treatment modalities are needed. Left-ventricular assist devices are a promising therapy option, however, especially as destination therapy, limited by its side-effects like stroke, infections and bleedings. In recent years, several cardiac repair strategies including stem cell injection, cardiac progenitors or myocardial tissue engineering have been investigated. Recent improvements in cell biology allow for the differentiation of large amounts of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). One of the cardiac repair strategies currently under evaluation is to transplant artificial heart tissue. Engineered heart tissue (EHT) is a three-dimensional in vitro created cardiomyocyte network, with functional properties of native heart tissue. We have created EHT-patches from hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Evidence for the impact of BAG3 on electrophysiological activity of primary culture of neonatal cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Homeostasis of proteins involved in contractility of individual cardiomyocytes and those coupling adjacent cells is of critical importance as any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction may result in cardiac irregular activity and heart failure. Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a stress-induced protein whose role in stabilizing myofibril proteins as well as protein quality control pathways, especially in the cardiac tissue, has captured much attention. Mutations of BAG3 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac complications such as dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we have used an in vitro model of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to investigate potential impacts of BAG3 on electrophysiological activity by employing the microelectrode array (MEA) technology. Our MEA data showed that BAG3 plays an important role in the cardiac signal generation as reduced levels of BAG3 led to lower signal frequency and amplitude. Our analysis also revealed that BAG3 is essential to the signal propagation throughout the myocardium, as the MEA data-based conduction velocity, connectivity degree, activation time, and synchrony were adversely affected by BAG3 knockdown. Moreover, BAG3 deficiency was demonstrated to be connected with the emergence of independently beating clusters of cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, BAG3 overexpression improved the activity of cardiomyocytes in terms of electrical signal amplitude and connectivity degree. Overall, by providing more in-depth analyses and characterization of electrophysiological parameters, this study reveals that BAG3 is of critical importance for electrical activity of neonatal cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2019-04-02", "authors": ["Farzaneh GTahrir", "JenniferGordon", "Arthur MFeldman", "JosephCheung", "KamelKhalili", "TahaMohseni Ahooyi"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.28471"}

Oxidative stress and apoptosis are believed to be involved in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS), the enzymatic hydrolysates of chitosan, have been reported to possess diverse biological activities including antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential role of COS against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and the effects of COS on apoptosis and oxidative stress in rats and H9C2 cells. Furthermore, we also shed light on the involved pathways during the whole process. For this purpose, first, we demonstrated that COS exhibited a significant protective effect on cardiac tissue by not only inducing a decrease in body and heart growth but also ameliorated oxidative damage and ECG alterations in DOX-treated rats. Second, we found that COS reversed the decrease of cell viability induced by DOX, reduced the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and Bcl-2/Bax ratio. COS treatment also results in reduced caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions, and an increase in the phosphorylation of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) in DOX-exposed H9C2 cells. Additionally, cellular homeostasis was re-established via stabilization of MAPK mediated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant-response element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling and transcription of downstream cytoprotective genes. In summary, these findings suggest that COS could be a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2019-04-01", "authors": ["YongtianZhang", "Khalil AliAhmad", "Farhan UllahKhan", "SiminYan", "Awais UllahIhsan", "QilongDing"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2019.03.027"}

However, PSC-CMs are usually immature in morphology and functionality and the maturity of PSC-CMs could not be determined accurately. In order to reasonably interpret the experimental results obtained by PSC-CMs, it is necessary to evaluate the maturity of PSC-CMs and find the key genes related to maturation.\nUsing the gene expression profiles of normal adult cardiac tissue and embryonic stem cell (ESC) samples, we identified gene pairs with identically relative expression orderings (REOs) within adult cardiac tissue but reversely identical in ESCs. Then, for a PSC-CM model, we calculated the maturity score as the percentage of these gene pairs that exhibit the same REOs in adult cardiac tissue. Lastly, the CellComp method was used to identify the maturation-related genes.\nThe maturity score increased gradually from 0.8401 for 18-week fetal cardiac tissue to 0.9997 for adult cardiac tissue. For four human PSC-CM models, the mature scores increased with prolonged culture time but were all below 0.8. The genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, immunity, and proliferation were dysregulated in the 1-year PSC-CMs compared with adult cardiac tissue.\nWe proposed a qualitative transcriptional signature to score the maturity degree of PSC-CMs. This score can reasonably track the maturity of PSC-CMs and be used to compare different PSC-CM culture methods.", "journal": "Stem cell research & therapy", "date": "2019-03-31", "authors": ["RouChen", "JunHe", "YumeiWang", "YouGuo", "JuanZhang", "LuyingPeng", "DuoWang", "QinLin", "JieZhang", "ZhengGuo", "LiLi"], "doi": "10.1186/s13287-019-1205-1\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3003552\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehv189\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.751412\n10.1089/scd.2014.0533\n10.7150/thno.19390\n10.1089/scd.2012.0490\n10.1016/j.addr.2015.04.019\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.04.021\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.07.012\n10.1073/pnas.1424042112\n10.1038/ncomms3307\n10.1038/nature12054\n10.1073/pnas.1313192110\n10.1172/JCI119776\n10.1152/ajpheart.2001.280.4.H1814\n10.1186/s12967-016-1083-6\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00145-P\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.032\n10.1177/153303461000900204\n10.1111/liv.13467\n10.1186/s12967-017-1302-9\n10.1007/978-1-4939-3578-9_5\n10.1093/nar/gkl995\n10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.249\n10.1093/nar/gkh066\n10.1093/bib/bbr041\n10.1089/scd.2011.0357\n10.1002/stem.1964\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.01.021\n10.1253/circj.CJ-12-0987\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.300558\n10.1152/ajpcell.00060.2009\n10.1172/JCI57426\n10.1196/annals.1427.004\n10.1038/nrneph.2017.126\n10.1161/CIRCEP.113.003638\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.03.039\n10.1371/journal.pone.0077784\n10.1074/jbc.M312664200\n10.1007/s12041-016-0623-4\n10.1007/s10974-008-9165-6\n10.1155/2015/654765\n10.1074/jbc.M607244200\n10.1152/ajpheart.00194.2009\n10.1016/j.matbio.2015.01.023\n10.1039/c2mb05466c\n10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.039\n10.1038/s41467-017-01946-x\n10.1038/s41586-018-0016-3"}

Electrical field excitation is a common intervention in the production of engineered tissue and the investigation of the electrical properties of in vitro cell cultures. In this work, we use strength-duration relationships to investigate systematically factors influencing electrical excitability of two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) neonatal rat ventricular myocyte cultures. We find that the strength of the voltage pulse is negatively correlated with the threshold duration, as predicted by the Lapicque-Hill equation, and show that higher pacing frequencies require higher thresholds to capture paced cultures. We also study the impact of properties intrinsic to the 2D and 3D cultures on strength-duration relationships. We show that a smaller culture dimension, perpendicular anisotropic culture orientation with respect to electrical field, higher proportion of added fibroblasts, and TBX18-induced pacemaker reprogramming independently result in higher stimulation thresholds. These properties reflect the characteristics of the well-insulated endogenous pacemaking tissue in the heart (sinoatrial node) and should guide the engineering of biological pacemakers for improved outcomes.

While many anuran amphibians like Xenopus laevis are not capable of such feats, they are able to repair lesser levels of cardiac damage, such as that caused by oxidative stress, to a far greater degree than mammals. Using an optogenetic stress induction model that utilizes the protein KillerRed, we have investigated the extent to which mechanisms of cardiac regeneration are conserved during the restoration of normal heart morphology post oxidative stress in X.\u00a0laevis tadpoles. We focused particularly on the processes of cardiomyocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation, as well as the pathways that facilitate the regulation of these processes. The cardiac response to KillerRed-induced injury in X.\u00a0laevis tadpole hearts consists of a phase dominated by indicators of cardiac stress, followed by a repair-like phase with characteristics similar to mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in urodeles and fish. In the latter phase, we found markers associated with partial dedifferentiation and cardiomyocyte proliferation in the injured tadpole heart, which, unlike in regenerating hearts, are not dependent on Notch or retinoic acid signaling. Ultimately, the X.\u00a0laevis cardiac response to KillerRed-induced oxidative stress shares characteristics with both mammalian and urodele/fish repair mechanisms, but is nonetheless a unique form of recovery, occupying an intermediate place on the spectrum of cardiac regenerative ability.

{"title": "Concise Review: Reduction of Adverse Cardiac Scarring Facilitates Pluripotent Stem Cell-Based Therapy for Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are an attractive, reliable source for generating functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration of infarcted heart. However, inefficient cell engraftment into host tissue remains a notable challenge to therapeutic success due to mechanical damage or relatively inhospitable microenvironment. Evidence has shown that excessively formed scar tissues around cell delivery sites present as mechanical and biological barriers that inhibit migration and engraftment of implanted cells. In this review, we focus on the functional responses of stem cells and cardiomyocytes during the process of cardiac fibrosis and scar formation. Survival, migration, contraction, and coupling function of implanted cells may be affected by matrix remodeling, inflammatory factors, altered tissue stiffness, and presence of electroactive myofibroblasts in the fibrotic microenvironment. Although paracrine factors from implanted cells can improve cardiac fibrosis, the transient effect is insufficient for complete repair of an infarcted heart.

Several antifibrotic approaches, including the use of pharmacological agents, gene therapies, microRNAs, and modified biomaterials, can prevent progression of heart failure and have been developed as adjunct therapies for stem cell-based regeneration.

The beta 2 adrenergic receptor (\u00df2-AR) pathway induces proliferation of c-kit+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) in vitro. We investigated if \u00df2-AR pharmacological stimulation could ameliorate endogenous CPC-mediated regeneration after a MI. C-kit+ CPC \u00df1-AR and \u00df2-AR expression was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. A significant increase in the percentage of CPCs expressing \u00df1-AR and \u00df2-AR was measured 7 days post-MI. Accordingly, 24\u00a0hrs of low serum and hypoxia in vitro significantly increased CPC \u00df2-AR expression. Cell viability and differentiation assays validated a functional role of CPC \u00df2-AR. The effect of pharmacological activation of \u00df2-AR was studied in C57 mice using fenoterol administered in the drinking water 1 week before MI or sham surgery or at the time of the surgery. MI induced a significant increase in the percentage of c-kit+ progenitor cells at 7 days, whereas pretreatment with fenoterol prolonged this response resulting in a significant elevated number of CPC up to 21 days post-MI. This increased number of CPC correlated with a decrease in infarct size. The immunofluorescence analysis of the heart tissue for proliferation, apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, cardiomyocytes surface area, and vessel density showed significant changes on the basis of surgery but no benefit due to fenoterol treatment. Cardiac function was not ameliorated by fenoterol administration when evaluated by echocardiography. Our results suggest that \u00df2-AR stimulation may improve the cardiac repair process by supporting an endogenous progenitor cell response but is not sufficient to improve the cardiac function.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2019-03-27", "authors": ["AmandaFinan", "MarieDemion", "PierreSicard", "MorganeGuisiano", "PatriceBideaux", "KevinMonceaux", "J\u00e9r\u00f4meThireau", "SylvainRichard"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.28461"}

We investigated the effect of testosterone and voluntary exercise on heart angiogenesis in castrated diabetic rats.\nSixty-three diabetic rats were treated with testosterone 2\u00a0mg/kg/day or voluntary exercise alone or combination of these two for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, heart tissue samples were collected and used for CD31 detection by immunohistochemical method and determination of miR-132 levels.\nmiR-132 levels and CD31 of heart tissue were higher after testosterone administration and in the voluntary exercise group in diabetic rats after 6 weeks. Combination of testosterone and voluntary exercise had synergistic effect on angiogenesis and miR-132 level. In castrated diabetic rats, there were significantly lower levels of miR-132 and CD31 in heart tissue compared to the diabetic group, whereas testosterone and exercise reversed these effects. In addition, testosterone supplementation plus exercise had an additive effect on miR-132 levels and CD31 in castrated diabetic rats.\nIt was concluded that castration in rats leads to reduced miR-132 levels and subsequently decreased angiogenesis in diabetes.

{"title": "A Remotely Controlled Transformable Soft Robot Based on Engineered Cardiac Tissue Construct.", "abstract": "Many living organisms undergo conspicuous or abrupt changes in body structure, which is often accompanied by a behavioral change. Inspired by the natural metamorphosis, robotic systems can be designed as reconfigurable to be multifunctional. Here, a tissue-engineered transformable robot is developed, which can be remotely controlled to assume different mechanical structures for switching locomotive function. The soft robot is actuated by a muscular tail fin that emulates the swimming of whales and works as a cellular engine powered by the synchronized contraction of striated cardiac microtissue constructs. For a transition of locomotive behavior, the robot can be optically triggered to transform from a spread to a retracted form, which effectively changes the bending stiffness of the tail fins, thus minimizing the propulsion output from the \"tail fin\" and effectively switching off the engine. With the unprecedented controllability and responsiveness, the transformable robot is implemented to work as a cargo carrier for programmed delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to selectively eradicate cancer cells. It is believed that the realization of the transformable concept paves a pathway for potential development of intelligent biohybrid robotic systems.", "journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "date": "2019-03-25", "authors": ["BingzheXu", "XiaominHan", "YuweiHu", "YimingLuo", "Chia-HungChen", "ZiChen", "PengShi"], "doi": "10.1002/smll.201900006"}
{"title": "Cardiac proteomics reveals the potential mechanism of microtubule associated protein 4 phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.", "abstract": "Our previous work suggested that microtubule associated protein 4 (MAP4) phosphorylation led to mitochondrial dysfunction in MAP4 phosphorylation mutant mice with cardiomyopathy, but the detailed mechanism was still unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential mechanism involved in mitochondrial dysfunction responsible for cardiomyopathy.\nThe present study was conducted to explore the potential mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction driven by MAP4 phosphorylation. Strain of mouse that mimicked constant MAP4 phosphorylation (S737 and S760) was generated. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis was applied to the heart tissue. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) were all analyzed on the basis of differential expressed proteins (DEPs).\nAmong the 72 cardiac DEPs detected between the two genotypes of mice, 12 were upregulated and 60 were downregulated. GO analysis showed the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component of DEPs, and KEGG enrichment analysis linked DEPs to 96 different biochemical pathways. In addition, the PPI network was also extended on the basis of DEPs as the seed proteins. Three proteins, including mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NF-\u03baB 1, reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75\u2009kDa subunit, mitochondrial and growth arrest, and DNA-damage-inducible proteins-interacting protein 1, which play an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial function, may correlate with MAP4 phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Western blot was used to validate the expression of the three proteins, which was consistent with iTRAQ experiments.\nThese findings revealed\u00a0that the DEPs caused by MAP4 phosphorylation in heart tissue using iTRAQ technique and may provide clues to uncover the potential mechanism of MAP4 phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.", "journal": "Burns & trauma", "date": "2019-03-25", "authors": ["LingfeiLi", "JunhuiZhang", "QiongZhang", "YueshengHuang", "JiongyuHu"], "doi": "10.1186/s41038-019-0146-3\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61889-4\n10.1186/s41038-016-0035-y\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.147\n10.1007/s00018-009-0187-z\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(199911)44:3<209::AID-CM6>3.0.CO;2-4\n10.1038/cddis.2014.369\n10.1247/csf.25.33\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2018.10.017\n10.1074/mcp.M114.038786\n10.1159/000430283\n10.1159/000485885\n10.1093/nar/gkn176\n10.1007/978-1-59745-515-2_6\n10.1007/s10557-013-6447-z\n10.1016/0002-8703(93)90718-O\n10.1016/j.mito.2016.03.007\n10.3892/ijmm.2016.2566\n10.1242/jcs.129999\n10.1073/pnas.1613701113\n10.1074/jbc.M212835200\n10.1016/j.bbagrm.2017.02.006\n10.1093/cvr/cvq265\n10.1038/s41420-017-0023-4\n10.1016/j.tcb.2008.10.003"}
{"title": "Methamphetamine produces cardiac damage and apoptosis by decreasing melusin.", "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) is an amphetamine-type drug that is highly addictive and widely abused. Many studies have shown that METH exposure causes severe damage not only to the nervous system but also to the cardiovascular system. Melusin protein is a mechanotransducer that plays an important role in maintaining normal heart function. However, the role of melusin in METH-induced cardiotoxicity has not yet been reported. We hypothesized that methamphetamine can produce cardiac damage and apoptosis by decreasing the quantity of melusin. To test this hypothesis, we determined the protein expression of melusin and apoptosis markers in METH-treated rats and primary rat cardiomyocytes. We also established a melusin-overexpressing cell model to assess the importance of melusin in maintaining antiapoptotic pathways. To confirm our findings from the in vitro and animal models, we also evaluated the apoptotic index of cardiomyocytes and the protein expression of apoptotic markers in postmortem heart tissues from deceased METH abusers and age-matched control subjects. The results showed that the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was increased significantly and that the protein expression of melusin was decreased after exposure to METH in primary rat cardiomyocytes, in rats and in humans. METH treatment also decreased the expression of the downstream proteins FAK, IQGAP1, p-AKT, p-GSK3\u03b2, and p-ERK in primary rat cardiomyocytes and in vivo. After overexpression of melusin, the above effects were partially reversed in primary rat cardiomyocytes. We conclude that METH can produce cardiac damage and apoptosis by decreasing melusin, while melusin-activated signaling by phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2, and ERK may be resistant to methamphetamine-induced myocardial apoptosis.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2019-03-25", "authors": ["XiaoyuSun", "YuWang", "BingXia", "ZhuLi", "JialinDai", "PingmingQiu", "AndeMa", "ZhoumengLin", "JiangHuang", "JiawenWang", "Wei-BingXie", "JieWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2019.03.015"}

{"title": "Dpep2 Emerging as a Modulator of Macrophage Inflammation Confers Protection Against CVB3-Induced Viral Myocarditis.", "abstract": "Overwhelming cardiac inflammation has been reported to be the pathogenic mechanism of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis (VMC), while the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Membrane-bound dipeptidases (MBD, also known as Dpep) have been shown to be involved in inflammatory diseases. However, the clear and direct evidence of their impacts on inflammation is still lacking. In this study, our results revealed that Dpep2 expression was remarkably increased during CVB3 infection, and primarily produced by the cardiac tissue-infiltrating macrophages instead of constitutive cardiomyocytes. Macrophages have been reported to play an important pathological role in driving VMC. Interestingly, macrophage-specific Dpep2 deletion robustly aggravated CVB3-induced cardiac inflammation, evidenced by augmented expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 in heart tissue. In addition, Dpep2-deficient bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) generated more TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 after CVB3 stimulation compared with the control BMDMs. Moreover, this suppressive effect of Dpep2 on macrophages relied on its repression on NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, but not on its conventional hydrolysate LTE4. Taken together, this study revealed that Dpep2 could protect against CVB3-induced VMC by acting as a suppressor of macrophage inflammation.

This fast-evolving technique holds broad scope in both clinical and basic research setting. Combination of optogenetics with optical mapping of voltage or calcium fluorescent probes facilitates 'all-optical' electrophysiology, allowing precise optogenetic actuation of cardiac tissue with high spatio-temporal resolution imaging of action potential and calcium transient morphology and conduction patterns. In this review, we provide a synopsis of optogenetics and discuss in detail its use and compatibility with optical interrogation of cardiac electrophysiology. We briefly discuss the benefits of all-optical cardiac control and electrophysiological interrogation compared to traditional techniques, and describe mechanisms, unique features and limitations of optically induced cardiac control.

High-energy heavy ions can deliver high radiation doses in small targets with reduced damage to the normal tissue compared to conventional X-rays. For this reason, charged particle therapy, widely used in oncology, can be a powerful tool for radiosurgery in cardiac diseases. We have recently performed a feasibility study in a swine model using high doses of high-energy C-ions to target specific cardiac structures. Interruption of cardiac conduction was observed in some animals. Here we report the biological effects measured in the pig heart tissue of the same animals six months after the treatment. Immunohistological analysis of the target tissue showed (1.) long-lasting vascular damage, i.e. persistent hemorrhage, loss of microvessels, and occurrence of siderophages, (2.) fibrosis and (3.) loss of polarity of targeted cardiomyocytes and wavy fibers with vacuolization. We conclude that the observed physiological changes in heart function are produced by radiation-induced fibrosis and cardiomyocyte functional inactivation.

{"title": "Dynamic Changes in Microvascular Flow Conductivity and Perfusion After Myocardial Infarction Shown by Image-Based Modeling.", "abstract": "Background Microcirculation is a decisive factor in tissue reperfusion inadequacy following myocardial infarction ( MI ). Nonetheless, experimental assessment of blood flow in microcirculation remains a bottleneck. We sought to model blood flow properties in coronary microcirculation at different time points after MI and to compare them with healthy conditions to obtain insights into alterations in cardiac tissue perfusion. Methods and Results We developed an image-based modeling framework that permitted feeding a continuum flow model with anatomical data previously obtained from the pig coronary microvasculature to calculate physiologically meaningful permeability tensors. The tensors encompassed the microvascular conductivity and were also used to estimate the arteriole-venule drop in pressure and myocardial blood flow. Our results indicate that the tensors increased in a bimodal pattern at infarcted areas on days 1 and 7 after MI while a nonphysiological decrease in arteriole-venule drop in pressure was observed; contrary, the tensors and the arteriole-venule drop in pressure on day 3 after MI , and in remote areas, were closer to values for healthy tissue. Myocardial blood flow calculated using the condition-dependent arteriole-venule drop in pressure decreased in infarcted areas. Last, we simulated specific modes of vascular remodeling, such as vasodilation, vasoconstriction, or pruning, and quantified their distinct impact on microvascular conductivity. Conclusions Our study unravels time- and region-dependent alterations of tissue perfusion related to the structural changes occurring in the coronary microvasculature due to MI . It also paves the way for conducting simulations in new therapeutic interventions in MI and for image-based microvascular modeling by applying continuum flow models in other biomedical scenarios.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2019-03-23", "authors": ["PolyxeniGkontra", "Wahbi KEl-Bouri", "Kerri-AnnNorton", "Andr\u00e9sSantos", "Aleksander SPopel", "Stephen JPayne", "Alicia GArroyo"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.118.011058\n10.1016/b978-0-12-800219-3.00009-7"}
{"title": "Placental epigenetics for evaluation of fetal congenital heart defects: Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD).", "abstract": "Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), the most common congenital heart defect, is characterized by a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. The pathogenesis of VSD is unknown in most clinical cases. There is a paucity of data relevant to epigenetic changes in VSD. The placenta is a fetal tissue crucial in cardiac development and a potentially useful surrogate for evaluating the development of heart tissue. To understand epigenetic mechanisms that may play a role in the development of VSD, genome-wide DNA methylation assay on placentas of 8 term subjects with isolated VSD and no known or suspected genetic syndromes and 10 unaffected controls was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay. We identified a total of 80 highly accurate potential CpGs in 80 genes for detection of VSD; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) 1.0 with significant 95% CI (FDR) p-values < 0.05 for each individual locus. The biological processes and functions for many of these differentially methylated genes are previously known to be associated with heart development or disease, including cardiac ventricle development (HEY2, ISL1), heart looping (SRF), cardiac muscle cell differentiation (ACTC1, HEY2), cardiac septum development (ISL1), heart morphogenesis (SRF, HEY2, ISL1, HEYL), Notch signaling pathway (HEY2, HEYL), cardiac chamber development (ISL1), and cardiac muscle tissue development (ACTC1, ISL1). In addition, we identified 8 microRNAs that have the potential to be biomarkers for the detection of VSD including: miR-191, miR-548F1, miR-148A, miR-423, miR-92B, miR-611, miR-2110, and miR-548H4.

{"title": "Cardiac Tissue Chips (CTCs) for Modeling Cardiovascular Disease.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular research and regenerative strategies have been significantly limited by the lack of relevant cell culture models that can recreate complex hemodynamic stresses associated with pressure-volume changes in the heart.\nTo address this issue, we designed a biomimetic cardiac tissue chip (CTC) model where encapsulated cardiac cells can be cultured in three-dimensional (3-D) fibres and subjected to hemodynamic loading to mimic pressure-volume changes seen in the left ventricle. These 3-D fibres are suspended within a microfluidic chamber between two posts and integrated within a flow loop. Various parameters associated with heart function, like heart rate, peak-systolic pressure, end-diastolic pressure and volume, end-systolic pressure and volume, and duration ratio between systolic and diastolic, can all be precisely manipulated, allowing culture of cardiac cells under developmental, normal, and disease states.\nWe describe two examples of how the CTC can significantly impact cardiovascular research by reproducing the pathophysiological mechanical stresses associated with pressure overload and volume overload. Our results using H9c2 cells, a cardiomyogenic cell line, clearly show that culture within the CTC under pathological hemodynamic loads accurately induces morphological and gene expression changes, similar to those seen in both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Under pressure overload, the cells within the CTC see increased hypertrophic remodeling and fibrosis, whereas cells subject to prolonged volume overload experience significant changes to cellular aspect ratio through thinning and elongation of the engineered tissue.\nThese results demonstrate that the CTC can be used to create highly relevant models where hemodynamic loading and unloading are accurately reproduced for cardiovascular disease modeling.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2019-03-21", "authors": ["Aaron JRogers", "Jessica MMiller", "RamaswamyKannappan", "PalaniappanSethu"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2019.2905763"}

{"title": "Inflammation and fibrosis in murine models of heart failure.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a consequence of various cardiovascular diseases and associated with poor prognosis. Despite progress in the treatment of heart failure in the past decades, prevalence and hospitalisation rates are still increasing. Heart failure is typically associated with cardiac remodelling. Here, inflammation and fibrosis are thought to play crucial roles. During cardiac inflammation, immune cells invade the cardiac tissue and modulate tissue-damaging responses. Cardiac fibrosis, however, is characterised by an increased amount and a disrupted composition of extracellular matrix proteins. As evidence exists that cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are potentially reversible in experimental and clinical set ups, they are interesting targets for innovative heart failure treatments. In this context, animal models are important as they mimic clinical conditions of heart failure patients. The advantages of mice in this respect are short generation times and genetic modifications. As numerous murine models of heart failure exist, the selection of a proper disease model for a distinct research question is demanding. To facilitate this selection, this review aims to provide an overview about the current understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in six frequently used murine models of heart failure. Hence, it compares the models of myocardial infarction with or without reperfusion, transverse aortic constriction, chronic subjection to angiotensin II or deoxycorticosterone acetate, and coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis in this context. It furthermore provides information about the clinical relevance and the limitations of each model, and, if applicable, about the recent advancements in their methodological proceedings.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2019-03-20", "authors": ["LucasBacmeister", "MichaelSchwarzl", "SvenjaWarnke", "BastianStoffers", "StefanBlankenberg", "DirkWestermann", "DianaLindner"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-019-0722-5"}

{"title": "Down-regulation of MEIS1 promotes the maturation of oxidative phosphorylation in perinatal cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Fetal cardiomyocytes shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation around the time of birth. Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (MEIS1) is a transcription factor that promotes glycolysis in hematopoietic stem cells. We reasoned that MEIS1 could have a similar role in the developing heart. We hypothesized that suppression of MEIS1 expression in fetal sheep cardiomyocytes leads to a metabolic switch as found at birth. Expression of MEIS1 was assayed in left ventricular cardiac tissue and primary cultures of cardiomyocytes from fetal (100- and 135-d gestation, term = 145 d), neonatal, and adult sheep. Cultured cells were treated with short interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress MEIS1. Oxygen consumption rate was assessed with the Seahorse metabolic flux analyzer, and mitochondrial activity was assessed by staining cells with MitoTracker Orange. Cardiomyocyte respiratory capacity increased with advancing age concurrently with decreased expression of MEIS1. MEIS1 suppression with siRNA increased maximal oxygen consumption in fetal cells but not in postnatal cells. Mitochondrial activity was increased and expression of glycolytic genes decreased when MEIS1 expression was suppressed. Thus, we conclude that MEIS1 is a key regulator of cardiomyocyte metabolism and that the normal down-regulation of MEIS1 with age underlies a gradual switch to oxidative metabolism.-Lindgren, I.

{"title": "Self-organization of conducting pathways explains electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissues with high fraction of non-conducting cells.", "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis occurs in many forms of heart disease and is considered to be one of the main arrhythmogenic factors. Regions with a high density of fibroblasts are likely to cause blocks of wave propagation that give rise to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, studies of the wave propagation through these regions are very important, yet the precise mechanisms leading to arrhythmia formation in fibrotic cardiac tissue remain poorly understood. Particularly, it is not clear how wave propagation is organized at the cellular level, as experiments show that the regions with a high percentage of fibroblasts (65-75%) are still conducting electrical signals, whereas geometric analysis of randomly distributed conducting and non-conducting cells predicts connectivity loss at 40% at the most (percolation threshold). To address this question, we used a joint in vitro-in silico approach, which combined experiments in neonatal rat cardiac monolayers with morphological and electrophysiological computer simulations. We have shown that the main reason for sustainable wave propagation in highly fibrotic samples is the formation of a branching network of cardiomyocytes. We have successfully reproduced the morphology of conductive pathways in computer modelling, assuming that cardiomyocytes align their cytoskeletons to fuse into cardiac syncytium. The electrophysiological properties of the monolayers, such as conduction velocity, conduction blocks and wave fractionation, were reproduced as well. In a virtual cardiac tissue, we have also examined the wave propagation at the subcellular level, detected wavebreaks formation and its relation to the structure of fibrosis and, thus, analysed the processes leading to the onset of arrhythmias.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2019-03-19", "authors": ["NinaKudryashova", "AygulNizamieva", "ValeriyaTsvelaya", "Alexander VPanfilov", "Konstantin IAgladze"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006597\n10.1152/physrev.00025.2003\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.08.020\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.12.024\n10.1093/cvr/cvq329\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e318207a35f\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.10.018\n10.1371/journal.pone.0068872\n10.1371/journal.pone.0166972\n10.1038/srep20835\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2006.00367.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0072950\n10.1093/europace/eum206\n10.1103/PhysRevA.38.2650\n10.1098/rsob.150038\n10.1038/s41598-017-07653-3\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2013\n10.1098/rsta.2013.0380\n10.1007/978-3-7643-8123-3_4\n10.1088/0951-7715/19/1/000\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000163\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.118101\n10.1038/sj.icb.7100054\n10.1146/annurev-matsci-062910-100407\n10.1038/srep24334\n10.1021/jp9608990\n10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79333-5\n10.1038/nature10216\n10.1103/PhysRevE.59.R6251\n10.1371/journal.pone.0127977\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.050\n10.21037/jtd.2017.07.43\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037619"}
{"title": "Adult Cardiac Stem Cell Aging: A Reversible Stochastic Phenomenon?", "abstract": "Aging is by far the dominant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases, whose prevalence dramatically increases with increasing age reaching epidemic proportions. In the elderly, pathologic cellular and molecular changes in cardiac tissue homeostasis and response to injury result in progressive deteriorations in the structure and function of the heart. Although the phenotypes of cardiac aging have been the subject of intense study, the recent discovery that cardiac homeostasis during mammalian lifespan is maintained and regulated by regenerative events associated with endogenous cardiac stem cell (CSC) activation has produced a crucial reconsideration of the biology of the adult and aged mammalian myocardium. The classical notion of the adult heart as a static organ, in terms of cell turnover and renewal, has now been replaced by a dynamic model in which cardiac cells continuously die and are then replaced by CSC progeny differentiation. However, CSCs are not immortal. They undergo cellular senescence characterized by increased ROS production and oxidative stress and loss of telomere/telomerase integrity in response to a variety of physiological and pathological demands with aging. Nevertheless, the old myocardium preserves an endogenous functionally competent CSC cohort which appears to be resistant to the senescent phenotype occurring with aging. The latter envisions the phenomenon of CSC ageing as a result of a stochastic and therefore reversible cell autonomous process. However, CSC aging could be a programmed cell cycle-dependent process, which affects all or most of the endogenous CSC population. The latter would infer that the loss of CSC regenerative capacity with aging is an inevitable phenomenon that cannot be rescued by stimulating their growth, which would only speed their progressive exhaustion. The resolution of these two biological views will be crucial to design and develop effective CSC-based interventions to counteract cardiac aging not only improving health span of the elderly but also

{"title": "Anti-Toll-like receptor 2 antibody inhibits nuclear factor kappa B activation and attenuates cardiac damage in high-fat-feeding rats.", "abstract": "Long-time consumption of high-fat food is a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases, and high-fat-related inflammation plays an important role in it. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, play important roles in high-fat-related inflammation. However, the impact of TLR2 on high-fat-associated cardiovascular complications is still unknown. In this study, we try to investigate the relationship between TLR2 and high-fat-related cardiac injury. SD rats were allocated to either a control group which were fed with normal diet or a high-fat group which were fed with high-fat diet for 5 months. At the last month, rats fed with high-fat diet were intraperitoneally injected with control normal mouse IgG or anti-TLR2 antibody. Heart tissues were collected for further analysis. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis results revealed that TLR2 expression was increased in the heart tissues from rats fed with high-fat diet and anti-TLR2 antibody had no effect on TLR2 expression. However, anti-TLR2 antibody alleviated masson staining area, levels of TGF-\u03b21 and Collagen I mRNA, and decreased TUNEL-positive myocardial cells and caspase-3 activity, suggesting that anti-TLR2 antibody protected cardiac cells against high-fat-induced cardiac fibrosis and cell apoptosis. By using immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and ELISA, we found that anti-TLR2 antibody blocked NF-\u03baB activation, inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-18 in the heart tissues from rats fed with high-fat diet. These results hinted that anti-TLR2 antibody might exert its protective effect via inhibition of the TLR2/NF-\u03baB/inflammation pathway. Our findings suggest that anti-TLR2 antibody has a preventive function against high-fat-induced deleterious effects in the heart, and anti-TLR2 antibody may be used as an attractive therapeutic option for high-fat-induced cardiac injury.", "journal": "Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "date": "2019-03-17", "authors": ["WanzhengWang", "LitaoWu", "XiaojuanDu", "FujunZhang", "Sayyed HanifUllah", "TingLei", "DongmingLi", "XiaofeiYan"], "doi": "10.1093/abbs/gmz009"}

However, current treatments are more palliative than curative, which only stall the progression of the disease, but not reverse the disease. While stem cells or bioactive molecules therapy is promising, the limited survival and engraftment of bioactive agent due to a hostile environment is a bottleneck for MI treatment. In order to maximize the utility of stem cells and bioactive molecules for myocardial repair and regeneration, various types of biomaterials have been developed. Among them, collagen-based biomaterial is widely utilized for cardiac tissue engineering and regeneration due to its optimal physical and chemical properties. In this review, we summarize the properties of collagen-based biomaterial. Then, we discuss collagen-based biomaterial currently being applied to treat MI alone, or together with stem cells and/or bioactive molecules. Finally, the delivery system of collagen-based biomaterial will also be discussed.", "journal": "Drug delivery and translational research", "date": "2019-03-17", "authors": ["Wei-QiangWu", "SongPeng", "Zhi-YuanSong", "ShuLin"], "doi": "10.1007/s13346-019-00627-0"}
{"title": "Semaphorin 3F Promotes Transendothelial Migration of Leukocytes in the Inflammatory Response After Survived Cardiac Arrest.", "abstract": "Leukocyte transmigration through the blood vessel wall is a fundamental step of the inflammatory response and requires expression of adhesion molecule PECAM-1. Accumulating evidence implicates that semaphorin (Sema) 3F and its receptor neuropilin (NRP) 2 are central regulators in vascular biology. Herein, we assess the role of Sema3F in leukocyte migration in vitro and in vivo. To determine the impact of Sema3F on leukocyte recruitment in vivo, we used the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. After the induction of peritonitis, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected daily with recombinant Sema3F or solvent for 3\u00a0days. Compared with solvent-treated controls, leukocyte count was increased in the peritoneal lavage of Sema3F-treated mice indicating that Sema3F promotes leukocyte extravasation into the peritoneal cavity. In line with this observation, stimulation of human endothelial cells with Sema3F enhanced the passage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) through the endothelial monolayer in the transwell migration assays. Conversely, silencing of endothelial Sema3F by siRNA transfection dampened diapedesis of PBMCs through the endothelium in vitro. xMechanistically, Sema3F induced upregulation of adhesion molecule PECAM-1 in endothelial cells and in murine heart tissue shown by immunofluorescence and western blotting. The inhibition of PECAM-1 by blocking antibody HEC7 blunted Sema3F-induced leukocyte migration in transwell assays. SiRNA-based NRP2 knockdown reduced PECAM-1 expression and migration of PBMCs in Sema3F-treated endothelial cells, indicating that PECAM-1 expression and leukocyte migration in response to Sema3F depend on endothelial NRP2. To assess the regulation of Sema3F in human inflammatory disease, we collected serum samples of patients from day 0 to day 7 after survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA, n\u2009=\u200941). First, we demonstrated enhanced migration of PBMCs through endothelial cells exposed to the serum of patients after OHCA in comparison to the serum of patients with stable coronary artery disease or healthy volunteers. Remarkably, serum samples of OHCA patients contained significantly higher Sema3F protein levels compared with CAD patients (CAD, n\u2009=\u200937) and healthy volunteers (n\u2009=\u200911), suggesting a role of Sema3F in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response after OHCA. Subgroup analysis revealed that elevated serum Sema3F levels after ROSC are associated with decreased survival, myocardial dysfunction, and prolonged vasopressor therapy, clinical findings that determine the outcome of post-resuscitation period after OHCA. The present study provides novel evidence that endothelial Sema3F controls leukocyte recruitment through a NRP2/PECAM-1-dependent mechanism. Sema3F serum concentrations are elevated following successful resuscitation suggesting that Sema3F might be involved in the inflammatory response after survived OHCA. Targeting the Sema3F/NRP2/PECAM-1 pathway could provide a novel approach to abolish overwhelming inflammation after resuscitation.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2019-03-17", "authors": ["StephanieReichert", "StefanieScheid", "TinaRoth", "MariusHerkel", "DianaPetrova", "AlexandraLinden", "MikiWeberbauer", "JenniferEsser", "PhilippDiehl", "SebastianGrundmann", "Hans-J\u00f6rgBusch", "KatrinFink", "ChristophBode", "MartinMoser", "ThomasHelbing"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-019-00985-4"}
{"title": "Human Heart Explant-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: Characterization and Effects on the In Vitro Recellularization of Decellularized Heart Valves.", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are particles released from different cell types and represent key components of paracrine secretion. Accumulating evidence supports the beneficial effects of EVs for tissue regeneration. In this study, discarded human heart tissues were used to isolate human heart-derived extracellular vesicles (hH-EVs). We used nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to physically characterize hH-EVs and mass spectrometry (MS) to profile the protein content in these particles. The MS analysis identified a total of 1248 proteins. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis in hH-EVs revealed the proteins involved in processes, such as the regulation of cell death and response to wounding. The potential of hH-EVs to induce proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis and wound healing was investigated in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that hH-EVs have the potential to induce proliferation and angiogenesis in endothelial cells, improve wound healing and reduce mesenchymal stem-cell adhesion. Last, we showed that hH-EVs were able to significantly promote mesenchymal stem-cell recellularization of decellularized porcine heart valve leaflets. Altogether our data confirmed that hH-EVs modulate cellular processes, shedding light on the potential of these particles for tissue regeneration and for scaffold recellularization.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2019-03-17", "authors": ["AmandaLeitolis", "Paula HansenSuss", "Jo\u00e3o GabrielRoderjan", "Addeli Bez BattiAngulski", "Francisco Diniz Affonsoda Costa", "Marco AugustoStimamiglio", "AlejandroCorrea"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms20061279\n10.1016/j.carpath.2015.02.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.307778\n10.4236/scd.2011.13008\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.199\n10.1371/journal.pone.0176000\n10.3390/genes4020152\n10.1007/s10571-016-0366-z\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.218123\n10.1152/ajpheart.00100.2018\n10.1038/nrd3978\n10.1111/jcmm.13407\n10.1038/srep45622\n10.1002/term.2127\n10.1016/j.carpath.2014.10.001\n10.1517/14712598.2015.1051527\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.026\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308139\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007195\n10.1080/20013078.2017.1390391\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-2046\n10.1093/cvr/cvu167\n10.21037/sci.2017.11.06\n10.1038/s41551-018-0229-7\n10.1242/jcs.076935\n10.3390/ijms18030514\n10.1080/09513590.2018.1498477\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.10.035\n10.1111/jcmm.12607\n10.1371/journal.pone.0138849\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309681\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64887-0\n10.1371/journal.pone.0126846\n10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.035\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.10.019\n10.1111/xen.12464\n10.1590/S0102-76382007000400012\n10.1002/term.2617\n10.1371/journal.pone.0054622\n10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.10.005\n10.1007/s12015-016-9715-z"}
{"title": "Selectins and Immune Cells in Acute Myocardial Infarction and Post-infarction Ventricular Remodeling: Pathophysiology and Novel Treatments.", "abstract": "The glycosciences aim to understand the impact of extracellular and intracellular carbohydrate structures on biological function. These glycans primarily fall into three major groups: lipid-linked carbohydrates that are referred to as glycosphingolipids or simply glycolipids; relatively short carbohydrate chains that are often O- or N-linked to proteins yielding common glycoproteins; and extended linear polymeric carbohydrate structures that are referred to as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Whereas, the impact of such carbohydrate structures has been extensively examined in cancer biology, their role in acute and chronic heart disease is less studied. In this context, a growing body of evidence indicates that glycans play an important role in immune mediated cell recruitment to damaged heart tissue to initiate wound healing and repair after injury. This is particularly important following ischemia and reperfusion that occurs in the heart in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. Here, immune system-mediated repair of the damaged myocardium plays a critical role in determining post-infarction ventricular remodeling, cardiac function, and patient outcome. Further, alterations in immune cell activity can promote the development of heart failure. The present review summarizes our current understanding of the phases of immune-mediated repair following myocardial infarction. It discusses what is known regarding glycans in mediating the recruitment of circulating immune cells during the early inflammatory stage of post-infarction repair, with focus on the selectin family of adhesion molecules. It offers future directions for research aimed at utilizing our knowledge of mechanisms underlying immune cell recruitment to either modulate leukocyte recruitment to the injured tissue or enhance the targeted delivery of biologic therapeutics such as stem cells in an attempt to promote repair of the damaged heart.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2019-03-16", "authors": ["Brian RWeil", "SriramNeelamegham"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2019.00300\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312017\n10.1126/science.1230719\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.02.032\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.303577\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.243162\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.000116\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.227454\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehl191\n10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01721-1\n10.1016/j.ahj.2011.09.002\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.224915\n10.1186/1755-1536-6-11\n10.1093/cvr/cvs018\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308640\n10.1152/ajpheart.1994.266.4.H1541\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehw002\n10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02136-8\n10.1016/j.jacc.2013.03.003\n10.1084/jem.20111009\n10.1111/nyas.12393\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.916346\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303204\n10.2353/ajpath.2007.060547\n10.1371/journal.pone.0137515\n10.1016/j.jacc.2009.08.089\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.254409\n10.1038/nbt.1989\n10.1038/nri3024\n10.1038/nri2779\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.052126\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.044164\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.115.303895\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.304295\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2016.11.006\n10.1016/j.carpath.2005.05.004\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.06.013\n10.1172/JCI87491\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.199471\n10.1093/cvr/cvu138\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.02.033\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2013.01.004\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301720\n10.1016/j.cub.2012.11.018\n10.1189/jlb.3MR0915-440R\n10.1038/s41598-017-04844-w\n10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06346.x\n10.1016/j.sbi.2016.09.013\n10.1021/bi0507130\n10.1083/jcb.117.4.895\n10.1126/science.1701274\n10.1074/jbc.M113.463653\n10.1006/bbrc.1995.1568\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00795.x\n10.1073/pnas.1222878110\n10.4161/cam.24714\n10.1182/blood-2014-07-588590\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.306748\n10.1172/JCI119556\n10.1083/jcb.128.4.661\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80180-6\n10.1128/MCB.01204-07\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80653-6\n10.1182/blood-2003-03-0836\n10.1182/blood-2002-04-1007\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-424366\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80137-3\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80217-4\n10.1074/jbc.M112.400929\n10.4049/jimmunol.1601636\n10.1084/jem.20101545\n10.1016/S1471-4914(03)00071-6\n10.1016/j.immuni.2007.03.011\n10.1182/blood-2009-07-231480\n10.1096/fj.07-104257\n10.1073/pnas.250484797\n10.1182/blood-2010-11-320705\n10.1016/S1074-7613(01)00166-2\n10.1073/pnas.142005099\n10.1038/srep30392\n10.1084/jem.178.2.623\n10.1083/jcb.112.3.491\n10.1172/JCI117066\n10.1161/01.CIR.92.3.492\n10.1152/ajpheart.1996.271.5.H2086\n10.1182/blood-2014-06-583351\n10.1080/15419060490471793\n10.1074/jbc.273.49.32506\n10.1074/jbc.270.19.11025\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.13.1322\n10.1016/S0008-6363(98)00266-1\n10.1055/s-0037-1613168\n10.1172/JCI116501\n10.1093/cvr/28.9.1414\n10.1161/JAHA.116.004255\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.014\n10.1002/jlb.57.1.45\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.116.307519\n10.1038/nm.2969\n10.1089/oli.2010.0229\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf1435\n10.1042/CS20120641\n10.1038/s41598-018-19581-x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000084828.50310.6A\n10.1016/S0006-3495(04)74136-3\n10.1038/nm1703\n10.4252/wjsc.v8.i3.73\n10.1182/blood-2004-02-0650\n10.1182/blood-2015-01-607366\n10.1002/stem.2435\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.033\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.09.026\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0602\n10.1096/fj.06-6558com\n10.1038/sj.mt.6300374\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.196030"}

In this study, we have used a Wistar rat model to investigate AS-associated histopathologic changes in various organs. Rats were sensitized with ovalbumin (1 mg s.c), and AS was induced by intravenous injection of ovalbumin (1 mg). Experimental groups included nonallergic rats (n = 6) and allergic rats (n = 6). Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored during one hour. Organs were harvested at the end of the experiment and prepared for histologic and immunohistochemical studies. Lung, small bowel mucosa and spleen were found to undergo heavy infiltration by mast cells and eosinophils, with less prominent mast cell infiltration of cardiac tissue. The mast cells in lung, small bowel and spleen exhibited increased expression of tryptase, c-kit and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by vascular endothelial cells was noted principally in lung, heart and small bowel wall. The Wistar rat model of AS exhibited accumulation of mast cells and eosinophils in the lung, small bowel, and spleen to a greater extent than in the heart.

In this study, we developed a novel biomimetic scaffold integrating oriented micro-pores with branched channel networks to mimic the anisotropy and vasculature of native myocardium. The oriented micro-pores were fabricated using an 'Oriented Thermally Induced Phase Separation (OTIPS)' technique, and the channel network was produced by embedding and subsequently dissolving a 3D-printed carbohydrate template after crosslinking. Micro-holes were incorporated on the wall of channels, which greatly enhanced the permeability of channels. The effect of the sacrificial template on the formation of oriented micro- pores was assessed. The mechanical properties of the scaffold were tuned by varying the temperature gradient and chitosan/collagen ratio to match the specific stiffness of native heart tissue. The engineered cardiac tissue achieved synchronized beating with electrical stimulation. Calcium transient results suggested the formation of connection between cardiomyocytes within scaffold.

{"title": "Perspectives on Directions and Priorities for Future Preclinical Studies in Regenerative Medicine.", "abstract": "The myocardium consists of numerous cell types embedded in organized layers of ECM (extracellular matrix) and requires an intricate network of blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves to provide nutrients and electrical coupling to the cells. Although much of the focus has been on cardiomyocytes, these cells make up <40% of cells within a healthy adult heart. Therefore, repairing or regenerating cardiac tissue by merely reconstituting cardiomyocytes is a simplistic and ineffective approach. In fact, when an injury occurs, cardiac tissue organization is disrupted at the level of the cells, the tissue architecture, and the coordinated interaction among the cells. Thus, reconstitution of a functional tissue must reestablish electrical and mechanical communication between cardiomyocytes and restore their surrounding environment. It is also essential to restore distinctive myocardial features, such as vascular patency and pump function. In this article, we review the current status, challenges, and future priorities in cardiac regenerative or reparative medicine. In the first part, we provide an overview of our current understanding of heart repair and comment on the main contributors and mechanisms involved in innate regeneration. A brief section is dedicated to the novel concept of rejuvenation or regeneration, which we think may impact future development in the field.

{"title": "Piscine orthoreovirus demonstrates high infectivity but low virulence in Atlantic salmon of Pacific Canada.", "abstract": "Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is ubiquitous in farmed Atlantic salmon and sometimes associated with disease - most notably, Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI). However, PRV is also widespread in non-diseased fish, particularly in Pacific Canada, where few cases of severe heart inflammation have been documented. To better understand the mechanisms behind PRV-associated disease, this study investigated the infection dynamics of PRV from Pacific Canada and the potential for experimental passage of putatively associated heart inflammation in Pacific-adapted Mowi-McConnell Atlantic salmon. Regardless of the PRV source (fish with or without HSMI-like heart inflammation), infections led to high-load viremia that induced only minor focal heart inflammation without significant transcriptional induction of inflammatory cytokines. Repeated screening of PRV dsRNA/ssRNA along with histopathology and gene expression analysis of host blood and heart tissues identified three distinct phases of infection: (1) early systemic dissemination and replication without host recognition; (2) peak replication, erythrocyte inclusion body formation and load-dependent host recognition; (3) long-term, high-load viral persistence with limited replication or host recognition sometimes accompanied by minor heart inflammation. These findings contrast previous challenge trials with PRV from Norway that induced severe heart inflammation and indicate that strain and/or host specific factors are necessary to initiate PRV-associated disease.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2019-03-15", "authors": ["Mark PPolinski", "Gary DMarty", "Heindrich NSnyman", "Kyle AGarver"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-40025-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183781\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165424\n10.1371/journal.pone.0131638\n10.1139/facets-2018-0008\n10.1371/journal.pone.0171471\n10.3354/dao059217\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2004.00549.x\n10.1186/s13567-016-0343-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0146229\n10.1371/journal.pone.0141475\n10.1111/jfd.12487\n10.1128/JVI.02154-10\n10.3354/dao022025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011487\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2008.00983.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0181109\n10.1371/journal.pone.0037269\n10.1111/j.1365-2052.2004.01220.x\n10.1186/s12864-016-3196-y\n10.1073/pnas.68.2.505\n10.1016/0034-5687(95)00065-8\n10.1016/j.dci.2017.02.005\n10.1111/j.1600-065X.1998.tb01275.x\n10.1186/1297-9716-43-27\n10.1016/j.meegid.2009.01.011\n10.1099/vir.0.048637-0\n10.1016/j.virusres.2017.11.024\n10.1111/j.1365-2761.2006.00710.x\n10.1186/1297-9716-45-35\n10.1186/1743-422X-10-230\n10.1006/viro.2002.1658\n10.1128/JVI.79.16.10289-10299.2005\n10.1128/JVI.00047-12\n10.1186/1743-422X-8-396\n10.3390/v9030049\n10.1186/s13567-018-0524-z\n10.1126/science.3016895\n10.3389/fpls.2019.00114\n10.1016/B978-0-12-407698-3.00001-6\n10.1128/mBio.00049-13\n10.1186/s13567-015-0154-7\n10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.009\n10.1111/jfd.12329\n10.3354/dao02451\n10.1016/j.fsi.2017.02.043\n10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.094\n10.1016/j.molbiopara.2013.07.002\n10.1093/bioinformatics/bts199\n10.1002/elps.201100335\n10.1038/nprot.2013.084\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170\n10.1093/nar/gku1207\n10.2144/000112488"}
{"title": "Sirt1 promotes autophagy and inhibits apoptosis to protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxic stress.", "abstract": "Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) exerts its cardioprotective effects in various cardiovascular diseases via multiple cellular activities. However, the therapeutic implications of Sirt1 in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The present study investigated whether Sirt1 regulates autophagy and apoptosis in hypoxic H9C2 cardiomyocytes and in an experimental hypoxic mouse model. Right ventricular outflow tract biopsies were obtained from patients with cyanotic or acyanotic congenital heart diseases. Adenovirus Ad\u2011Sirt1 was used to activate Sirt1 and Ad\u2011Sh\u2011Sirt1 was used to inhibit Sirt1 expression in H9C2 cells, in order to investigate the effect of Sirt1 on cellular autophagy and apoptosis. SRT1720, a pharmacological activator of Sirt1 and EX\u2011527, a Sirt1 antagonist, were administered to mice to explore the role of Sirt1 in hypoxic cardiomyocytes in vivo. The levels of autophagy and apoptosis\u2011related proteins were evaluated using western blotting. Apoptosis was investigated by TUNEL staining and Annexin V/7\u2011aminoactinomycin D flow cytometry analysis. Heart tissue samples from cyanotic patients exhibited increased autophagy and apoptosis, as well as elevated Sirt1 levels, compared with the noncyanotic control samples. The data from the western blot analysis revealed that Sirt1 promoted autophagic flux and reduced apoptosis in hypoxic H9C2 cells. In addition, Sirt1 activated AMP\u2011activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the AMPK inhibitor Compound C abolished the effect of Sirt1 on autophagy activation. Further exploration of the mechanism revealed that Sirt1 protects hypoxic cardiomyocytes from apoptosis, at least in part, through inositol requiring kinase enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1). Consistent with the in vitro results, treatment with the Sirt1 activator SRT1720 activated AMPK, inhibited IRE1\u03b1, enhanced autophagy, and decreased apoptosis in the heart tissues of normoxic mice compared with the hypoxia control group. Opposite changes were observed in hypoxic mice treated with the Sirt1 inhibitor EX\u2011527.

{"title": "Cardiomyocytes facing fibrotic conditions re-express extracellular matrix transcripts.", "abstract": "Pathophysiological conditions, such as myocardial infarction and mechanical overload affect the mammalian heart integrity, leading to a stiffened fibrotic tissue. With respect to the pathophysiology of cardiac fibrosis but also in the limelight of upcoming approaches of cardiac cell therapy it is of interest to decipher the interaction of cardiomyocytes with fibrotic matrix. Therefore, we designed a hydrogel-based model to engineer fibrotic tissue in vitro as an approach to predict the behavior of cardiomyocytes facing increased matrix rigidity. Here, we generated pure induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and cultured them on engineered polyacrylamide hydrogels matching the elasticities of healthy as well as fibrotic cardiac tissue. Only in cardiomyocytes cultured on matrices with fibrotic-like elasticity, transcriptional profiling revealed a substantial up-regulation of a whole panel of cardiac fibrosis-associated transcripts, including collagen I and III, decorin, lumican, and periostin. In addition, matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, known to be essential in cardiac remodeling, were found to be elevated as well as insulin-like growth factor 2. Control experiments with primary cardiac fibroblasts were analyzed and did not show comparable behavior. In conclusion, we do not only present a snapshot on the transcriptomic fingerprint alterations in cardiomyocytes under pathological conditions but also provide a new reproducible approach to study the effects of fibrotic environments to various cell types.

Additionally, there was a significant decrease in tissue malondialdehyde and increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase concentration in both the plasma and heart tissue. Furthermore, there was a decrease in plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein with an increased high-density lipoprotein concentration in ruthenium-treated rats. This was further evidenced by reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6, and cardiac C-reactive protein concentrations in ruthenium-treated rats.\nRuthenium coupled with dietary intervention decreased the risk of developing cardiac injury, thus preventing CVD in prediabetes.

{"title": "Long-term impact of maternal high-fat diet on offspring cardiac health: role of micro-RNA biogenesis.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a worldwide leading cause of death. Diet and obesity are particularly of high concern in heart disease etiology. Gravely, altered nutrition during developmental windows of vulnerability can have long-term impact on heart health; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the understanding of the initiation of chronic diseases related to developmental exposure to environmental challenges, deregulations in epigenetic mechanisms including micro-RNAs have been proposed as key events. In this context, we aimed at delineating the role of micro-RNAs in the programming of cardiac alterations induced by early developmental exposure to nutritional imbalance. To reach our aim, we developed a human relevant model of developmental exposure to nutritional imbalance by maternally exposing rat to high-fat diet during gestation and lactation. In this model, offspring exposed to maternal high-fat diet developed cardiac hypertrophy and increased extracellular matrix depot compared to those exposed to chow diet. Microarray approach performed on cardiac tissue allowed the identification of a micro-RNA subset which was down-regulated in high-fat diet-exposed animals and which were predicted to regulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2)-mediated remodeling. As indicated by in vitro approaches and gene expression measurement in the heart of our animals, decrease in DiGeorge critical region 8 (DGCR8) expression, involved in micro-RNA biogenesis, seems to be a critical point in the alterations of the micro-RNA profile and the TGF\u03b2-mediated remodeling induced by maternal exposure to high-fat diet.

The aims of this study were to develop a rat model of OSAS and to validate the use of the model by investigating respiratory and cardiovascular physiological parameters and morphological changes by light microscopy and electron microscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to the model group (n=30) and the control group (n=30). The rats in the OSAS model group were injected with 0.1 ml sodium hyaluronate solution into the upper respiratory tract at the junction between the hard and soft palate. After one month, the model and normal rats were compared using tests of respiratory and cardiac function, and histology and electron microscopy of the lung and cardiac tissue. RESULTS In the rat model of OSAS, airway obstruction resulted in the collapse of the upper airway. Tests of respiratory function showed that the oxygen partial pressure, oxygen concentration, and oxygen saturation in the model group were significantly lower when compared with the control group. In the model group, histology of the heart showed cardiac myocyte disarray, and electron microscopy showed vacuolar degeneration and mitochondrial abnormalities. The rat model of upper airway occlusion showed pulmonary and cardiac changes that have been described in OSAS. CONCLUSIONS A rat model of upper airway occlusion resulted in physiological and morphological changes in the lung and heart due to hypoxia, and may be used for future studies on OSAS.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2019-03-10", "authors": ["YongyiLiu", "LuGao", "WeinongLv", "LinLin", "YiWang", "HailinHe", "FanJiang", "FanFeng"], "doi": "10.12659/MSM.913056"}
{"title": "Cardiomyopathy Mutations in Metavinculin Disrupt Regulation of Vinculin-Induced F-Actin Assemblies.", "abstract": "Debilitating heart conditions, notably dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (CMs), are associated with point mutations in metavinculin, a larger isoform of the essential cytoskeletal protein vinculin. Metavinculin is co-expressed with vinculin at sub-stoichiometric ratios in cardiac tissues. CM mutations in the metavinculin tail domain (MVt) occur within the extra 68-residue insert that differentiates it from the vinculin tail domain (Vt). Vt binds actin filaments (F-actin) and promotes vinculin dimerization to bundle F-actin into thick fibers. While MVt binds to F-actin in a similar manner to Vt, MVt is incapable of F-actin bundling and inhibits Vt-mediated F-actin bundling. We performed F-actin co-sedimentation and negative-stain EM experiments to dissect the coordinated roles of metavinculin and vinculin in actin fiber assembly and the effects of three known metavinculin CM mutations. These CM mutants were found to weakly induce the formation of disordered F-actin assemblies. Notably, they fail to inhibit Vt-mediated F-actin bundling and instead promote formation of large assemblies embedded with linear bundles. Computational models of MVt bound to F-actin suggest that MVt undergoes a conformational change licensing the formation of a protruding sub-domain incorporating the insert, which sterically prevents dimerization and bundling of F-actin by Vt. Sub-domain formation is destabilized by CM mutations, disrupting this inhibitory mechanism. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the ability of metavinculin to tune actin organization by vinculin and suggest that dysregulation of this process by CM mutants could underlie their malfunction in disease.", "journal": "Journal of molecular biology", "date": "2019-03-08", "authors": ["MuzaddidSarker", "Hyunna TLee", "LinMei", "AndreyKrokhotin", "Santiago Espinosade Los Reyes", "LauraYen", "Lindsey MCostantini", "JackGriffith", "Nikolay VDokholyan", "Gregory MAlushin", "Sharon LCampbell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmb.2019.02.024"}

An additional 12 mice were given an injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and formed a healthy control (Normal) group. After performing echocardiography and measuring the ratio of heart weight (HW)/tibia length (TL) at 14 days, all mice were euthanased. Morphological examination was performed following haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's staining of heart tissues. Ultrastructural changes were observed by electron microscopy. Cardiac protein expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) were measured by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and Western blotting.\nCompared with the untreated model group, acupuncture at PC6 lowered the heart rate, reduced the ratio of HW/TL, improved the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall thickness (LVAWd), LV end-diastolic anterior wall thickness (LVAWs), LV end-systolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWd), LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWs), and fractional shortening (FS) as observed by echocardiography (ISO+MA(PC6) vs. ISO groups: P<0.05). Moreover, evidence from morphological studies demonstrated that acupuncture at PC6 inhibited myocardial hypertrophy and collagen deposition, and normalised the ultrastructural changes. In addition, ANP and TNF\u03b1 expression were attenuated in the verum acupuncture group compared with the untreated model group (ISO+MA(PC6) vs. ISO groups: P<0.05).\nThe results demonstrated that acupuncture at PC6 attenuates sympathetic overactivity.

However, once the implanted tissue is in place, monitoring its function is difficult and involves indirect methods, while intervention necessarily requires an invasive procedure and available medical attention. To overcome this, methods of integrating electronic components into engineered tissues have been recently presented. These allow for remote monitoring of tissue function as well as intervention through stimulation and controlled drug release. Here, an improved hybrid microelectronic tissue construct capable of withstanding the dynamic environment of the beating heart without compromising electronic or mechanical functionality is reported. While the reported system is enabled to sense the function of the engineered tissue and provide stimulation for pacing, an electroactive polymer on the electronics enables it to release multiple drugs in parallel.

{"title": "Sensitivity of stress and strain calculations to passive material parameters in cardiac mechanical models using unloaded geometries.", "abstract": "Cardiac stress (load) and strain (stretch) are widely studied indicators of cardiac function and outcome, but are difficult or impossible to directly measure in relation to the cardiac microstructure. An alternative approach is to estimate these states using computer methods and image-based measurements, but this still requires knowledge of the tissue material properties and the unloaded state, both of which are difficult to determine. In this work, we tested the sensitivity of these two interdependent unknowns (reference geometry and material parameters) on stress and strain calculations in cardiac tissue. Our study used a finite element model of the human ventricle, with a hyperelastic passive material model, and was driven by a cell model mediated active contraction. We evaluated 21 different published parameter sets for the five parameters of the passive material model, and for each set we optimised the corresponding unloaded geometry and contractility parameter to model a single pressure-volume loop. The resulting mechanics were compared, and calculated systolic stresses were largely insensitive to the chosen parameter set when an unloading algorithm was used. Meanwhile, material strain calculations varied substantially depending on the choice of material parameters. These results indicate that determining the correct material and unloaded configuration may be highly important to understand strain driven processes, but less so for calculating stress estimates.", "journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "date": "2019-03-02", "authors": ["SKallhovd", "JSundnes", "S TWall"], "doi": "10.1080/10255842.2019.1579312"}
{"title": "Beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cell delivery via a novel cardiac bioscaffold on right ventricles of pulmonary arterial hypertensive rats.", "abstract": "Right ventricular failure (RVF) is a common cause of death in patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The current treatment for PAH only moderately improves symptoms, and RVF ultimately occurs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new treatment strategies to protect against right ventricle (RV) maladaptation despite PAH progression. In this study, we hypothesize that local mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) delivery via a novel bioscaffold can improve RV function despite persistent PAH. To test our hypothesis, we induced PAH in adult rats with SU5416 and chronic hypoxia exposure; treated with rat MSCs delivered by intravenous injection, intramyocardial injection, or epicardial placement of a bioscaffold; and then examined treatment effectiveness by in vivo pressure-volume measurement, echocardiography, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that compared with other treatment groups, only the MSC-seeded bioscaffold group resulted in RV functional improvement, including restored stroke volume, cardiac output, and improved stroke work. Diastolic function indicated by end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship was improved by the local MSC treatments or bioscaffold alone. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and RV fibrosis were both reduced, and von Willebrand factor expression was restored by the MSC-seeded bioscaffold treatment. Overall, our study suggests a potential new regenerative therapy to rescue the pressure-overload failing RV with persistent pulmonary vascular disease, which may improve quality of life and/or survival of PAH patients. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We explored the effects of mesenchymal stem cell-seeded bioscaffold on right ventricles (RVs) of rats with established pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

{"title": "Fibroblast Primary Cilia Are Required for Cardiac Fibrosis.", "abstract": "The primary cilium is a singular cellular structure that extends from the surface of many cell types and plays crucial roles in vertebrate development, including that of the heart. Whereas ciliated cells have been described in developing heart, a role for primary cilia in adult heart has not been reported. This, coupled with the fact that mutations in genes coding for multiple ciliary proteins underlie polycystic kidney disease, a disorder with numerous cardiovascular manifestations, prompted us to identify cells in adult heart harboring a primary cilium and to determine whether primary cilia play a role in disease-related remodeling.\nHistological analysis of cardiac tissues from C57BL/6 mouse embryos, neonatal mice, and adult mice was performed to evaluate for primary cilia. Three injury models (apical resection, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction) were used to identify the location and cell type of ciliated cells with the use of antibodies specific for cilia (acetylated tubulin, \u03b3-tubulin, polycystin [PC] 1, PC2, and KIF3A), fibroblasts (vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and fibroblast-specific protein-1), and cardiomyocytes (\u03b1-actinin and troponin I). A similar approach was used to assess for primary cilia in infarcted human myocardial tissue. We studied mice silenced exclusively in myofibroblasts for PC1 and evaluated the role of PC1 in fibrogenesis in adult rat fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.\nWe identified primary cilia in mouse, rat, and human heart, specifically and exclusively in cardiac fibroblasts. Ciliated fibroblasts are enriched in areas of myocardial injury. Transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 signaling and SMAD3 activation were impaired in fibroblasts depleted of the primary cilium. Extracellular matrix protein levels and contractile function were also impaired. In vivo, depletion of PC1 in activated fibroblasts after myocardial infarction impaired the remodeling response.\nFibroblasts in the neonatal and adult heart harbor a primary cilium. This organelle and its requisite signaling protein, PC1, are required for critical elements of fibrogenesis, including transforming growth factor \u03b2-1-SMAD3 activation, production of extracellular matrix proteins, and cell contractility. Together, these findings point to a pivotal role of this organelle, and PC1, in disease-related pathological cardiac remodeling and suggest that some of the cardiovascular manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease derive directly from myocardium-autonomous abnormalities.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2019-03-02", "authors": ["ElisaVillalobos", "AlfredoCriollo", "Gabriele GSchiattarella", "FranciscoAltamirano", "Kristin MFrench", "Herman IMay", "NanJiang", "Ngoc Uyen NhiNguyen", "DiegoRomero", "Juan CarlosRoa", "LorenaGarc\u00eda", "GuillermoDiaz-Araya", "EugeniaMorselli", "AnwarulFerdous", "Simon JConway", "Hesham ASadek", "Thomas GGillette", "SergioLavandero", "Joseph AHill"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028752\n10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.025\n10.1152/ajprenal.00373.2015\n10.1242/jcs.046276\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.033\n10.1038/nature12833\n10.1038/ncomms11024\n10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.012\n10.1172/JCI69395\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.06.012\n10.1038/nature12639\n10.1016/B978-0-12-397944-5.00001-8\n10.1093/biosci/biu174\n10.1242/dmm.003194\n10.1016/j.krcp.2014.05.002\n10.1002/dvdy.24524\n10.14348/molcells.2018.2307\n10.1016/bs.mcb.2015.01.008\n10.1016/bs.mcb.2015.01.008\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2016.05.015\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.08.037\n10.1073/pnas.0836980100\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033368\n10.1016/j.ceb.2013.04.011\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1016/j.celrep.2013.05.020\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00066\n10.1007/s00018-013-1349-6\n10.1186/s12860-015-0059-3\n10.3390/cells4040687\n10.1016/j.bpj.2018.02.019\n10.1056/NEJMra1300575\n10.1586/14779072.2013.839942\n10.1073/pnas.1323292111\n10.1002/eji.201847583\n10.4161/org.27483\n10.1038/nature14269\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305381\n10.1007/s12265-012-9406-3\n10.1056/NEJMra072139\n10.1111/pedi.12119\n10.1172/JCI40295\n10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.04.030\n10.1091/mbc.E10-05-0407\n10.1016/j.bpc.2010.02.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013537\n10.1172/JCI58978\n10.1681/ASN.2006030234"}

{"title": "Calpain-2 promotes MKP-1 expression protecting cardiomyocytes in both in vitro and in vivo mouse models of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "We recently reported that doxorubicin decreased the expression of calpain-1/2, while inhibition of calpain activity promoted doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury in mice. In this study, we investigated whether and how elevation of calpain-2 could affect doxorubicin-triggered cardiac injury. Transgenic mice with inducible cardiomyocyte-specific expression of calpain-2 were generated. An acute cardiotoxicity was induced in both transgenic mice and their relevant wild-type littermates by injection of a single dose of doxorubicin (20\u00a0mg/kg) and cardiac injury was analyzed 5 days after doxorubicin injection. Cardiomyocyte-specific up-regulation of calpain-2 did not induce any adverse cardiac phenotypes under physiological conditions by age 3 months, but significantly reduced myocardial injury and improved myocardial function in doxorubicin-treated mice. Cardiac protection of calpain-2 up-regulation was also observed in a mouse model of chronic doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Up-regulation of calpain-2 increased the protein levels of mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in cultured mouse cardiomyocytes and heart tissues. Over-expression of MKP-1 prevented, whereas knockdown of MKP-1 augmented doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, knockdown of MKP-1 offset calpain-2-elicited protective effects against doxorubicin-induced injury in cultured cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, up-regulation of calpain-2 reduced the protein levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and consequently promoted Akt activation, leading to increased MKP-1 protein steady-state levels by inhibiting its degradation. Collectively, this study reveals a new role of calpain-2 in promoting MKP-1 expression via phosphatase and tensin homolog/Akt signaling.

{"title": "A minimally invasive robotic surgery approach to perform totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass on beating hearts.", "abstract": "The currently available robotic systems rely on rigid heart stabilizers to perform totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass (TECAB) surgery on beating hearts. Although such stabilizers facilitate the anastomosis procedure by immobilizing the heart and holding the surgery site steady, they can cause damage to the heart tissue and rupture of the capillary vessels, due to applying relatively large pressures on the epicardium. In this paper, we propose an advanced robotic approach to perform TECAB on a beating heart with minimal invasiveness. The idea comes from the fact that the main pulsations of the heart occur as excursions in normal direction, i.e., perpendicular to the heart surface. We devise a 1-DOF flexible heart stabilizer which eliminates the lateral movements of the heart, and a 1-DOF compensator mechanism which follows the heart trajectory in the normal direction, thus canceling the relative motion between the surgical tool and the heart surface. In fact, we bring a compromise between two radical approaches of operating on a completely immobilized beating heart with no heart motion compensation, and operating on a freely beating heart with full compensation of heart motion, considering the invasiveness of the first and the technical challenges of the second approach. We propose operating on a partially stabilized beating heart with unidirectional compensation of the heart motion; the flexible stabilizer would exert much less holding force to the heart tissue and the robotic system with unidirectional compensator would be technically feasible. In the proposed approach, a motion sensor mounted on the stabilizer measures the heart excursion data and sends it into a control unit. A predictive controller uses this data to generate an automated trajectory. The slave robots follow this trajectory, which is superimposed on the surgeon's tele-operation commands received from a master console. Finally, the tool-activation units in the slave robots actuate the articulated laparoscopic tools to perform the anastomosis procedure. The evaluation of the hypothesis showed that our solution for the robotic TECAB on beating heart is both practical and cost effective. We showed in an in-vivo study that the flexible stabilizer can effectively restrict the heart lateral movements, while allowing for its normal excursion. We found readily available linear motors which could afford the high forces, speeds and accelerations required for following the heart trajectory. Finally, we showed that the tool-activation unit is capable of providing the maneuverability and workspace required for the most challenging task of CABG procedure, i.e., anastomosis suturing.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2019-02-26", "authors": ["AlirezaAlamdar", "ShahrzadHanife", "FarzamFarahmand", "SaeedBehzadipour", "AlirezaMirbagheri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2019.02.005"}

We conducted targeted DNA methylation sequencing to identify DNA methylation alterations in coding and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) across different etiological subtypes of HF.\nA targeted bisulfite sequence capture sequencing platform was applied to DNA extracted from cardiac interventricular septal tissue of 30 male HF patients encompassing causes including hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and 9 control patients with nonfailing hearts. We detected 62\u2009678 differentially methylated regions in the studied HF cohort. By comparing each HF subgroup to the nonfailing control group, we identified 195 unique differentially methylated regions: 5 in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, 151 in dilated cardiomyopathy, and 55 in ischemic cardiomyopathy. These translated to 4 genes/1 ncRNA in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, 131 genes/17 ncRNA in dilated cardiomyopathy, and 51 genes/5 ncRNA in ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Since hAM has been used lately to patch diseased hearts in patients and has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic benefits, it qualifies as a cardiac compatible and clinically relevant heart tissue scaffold. The aim of this study was to test the ability of the hAM to support attachment, differentiation, and maturation of hiPSC-derived CMs in vitro. hAMs were prepared from term placenta. An in-house generated hiPSC line was used for CM derivation. hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors were cultured on the surface of cryopreserved hAMs and in the presence of cytokines promoting cardiac differentiation. CMs grown on hAM and popular basement membrane matrix (BMM) Matrigel\u2122 were compared for the following aspects of cardiac development: the morphology of cardiomyocytes with respect to shape and cellular alignments, levels of cardiac-related gene transcript expression, functionality in terms of spontaneous calcium fluxes and mitochondrial densities and distributions. hAM is biocompatible with hiPSC-derived CMs. hAM increased cardiac transcription regulator and myofibril protein transcript expression, accelerated intracellular calcium transients, and enhanced cellular mitochondrial complexity of its cardiomyocytes in comparison to cardiomyocytes differentiated on Matrigel\u2122. Our data suggests that hAM supports differentiation and improves cardiomyogenesis in comparison to Matrigel\u2122. hAMs are natural, easily and largely available.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we investigated whether monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1), a negative regulator of inflammation, was involved in the minocycline-induced cardioprotection in myocardial I/R in vivo and in vitro models. Myocardial ischemia was induced in rats by left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 1\u2009h and followed by 48\u2009h reperfusion. Minocycline was administered prior to ischemia (45\u2009mg/kg, ip, BID, for 1\u2009d) and over the course of reperfusion (22.5\u2009mg/kg, ip, BID, for 2\u2009d).

Administration of minocycline significantly decreased the infarct size, alleviated myocardial cell damage, elevated left ventricle ejection fraction, and left ventricle fractional shortening following I/R injury along with significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in heart tissue.

Pretreatment with minocycline (1-50\u2009\u03bcmol/L) dose-dependently increased the cell viability and inhibited OGD/R-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6. Furthermore, minocycline dose-dependently inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 in H9c2 cells subjected to OGD/R. In both the in vivo and in vitro models, minocycline significantly increased MCPIP1 protein expression; knockdown of MCPIP1 with siRNA in H9c2 cells abolished all the protective effects of minocycline against OGD/R-induced injury.

Extracellular field potential signals generated from the cells were recorded. We found that under electrical stimulation, cardiomyocytes were triggered to alter their field potential, while non-excitable cells were not triggered.

Results have also shown that increased cardiomyocyte cell number led to increased magnitude and occurrence of the cell responses. This relationship could be used to detect the viable cells in a cardiac tissue. Application of variable ES signals on different cardiomyocyte clusters has shown that the application of ES clearly boosted cardiomyocytes electrical activities according to the stimulation frequency.

{"title": "Protective effect of Xin-Ji-Er-Kang on cardiovascular remodeling in high salt-induced hypertensive mice.", "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Xin-Ji-Er-Kang (XJEK) on high salt-induced hypertensive mice. Mice with high-salt diet-induced hypertension were divided into four groups: Control (standard diet alone for 8 weeks), model (diet containing 8% NaCl for 8 weeks and intragastric administration of distilled water for the last 4 weeks), XJEK + high-salt-treated (diet containing 8% NaCl for 8 weeks and intragastric administration of XJEK for the last 4 weeks) and irbesartan + high-salt-treated (diet containing 8% NaCl for 8 weeks with intragastric administration of irbesartan for the last 4 weeks). The hemodynamic index and cardiac pathological changes in the hypertensive mice were then examined. An aortic ring apparatus was used to detect acetylcholine-dependent endothelium relaxation function. Colorimetric analysis was applied to determine serum nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde content; ELISA was employed to measure brain natriuretic peptide, serum angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1 content and aldosterone; and immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in cardiac tissues. XJEK improved the heart systolic and diastolic function, ameliorated hemodynamic parameters and cardiovascular remodeling indices, blunted the cardiac pathological changes and improved endothelial dysfunction (ED) via boosting eNOS activity, promoting NO bioavailability and decreasing serum Ang II content. Furthermore, treatment with XJEK inhibited the increase of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression and the decrease of IL-10 expression in cardiac tissues, and ameliorated oxidative stress status. Therefore, XJEK exerted protective effects against high salt-induced hypertension and cardiovascular remodeling in mice via improving ED, restoring pro- and anti-inflammatory factor balance and decreasing oxidative stress.", "journal": "Experimental and therapeutic medicine", "date": "2019-02-21", "authors": ["GuangyaoHuang", "PanCheng", "LingDing", "LiWang", "JuanHu", "YongxueZhang", "GuoweiCai", "MeilingChen", "AizongShen", "ShanGao"], "doi": "10.3892/etm.2018.7105\n10.1111/j.1755-5922.2010.00180.x\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.191259\n10.1007/s11906-011-0211-1\n10.1007/s11906-011-0241-8\n10.1002/dmrr.539\n10.1159/000320387\n10.1111/1440-1681.12595\n10.1016/j.jep.2014.07.006\n10.1002/cphy.c150008\n10.1378/chest.125.2.572\n10.1152/ajpheart.00692.2005\n10.1152/ajpheart.00331.2003\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000051459.74466.46\n10.1073/pnas.94.26.14483\n10.1172/JCI118623\n10.1371/journal.pone.0104020\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00128\n10.1146/annurev.physiol.59.1.395\n10.1161/01.RES.87.10.840\n10.1152/ajpcell.00287.2006\n10.1093/ajh/5.9.585\n10.1186/1472-6882-13-173\n10.1161/01.STR.0000033132.85123.6A\n10.1093/ajh/hpt225\n10.2174/157016112803520819\n10.1016/j.jash.2008.03.001\n10.3736/jcim20120313\n10.1186/s12906-017-1846-5\n10.1055/s-0035-1556586\n10.1002/ptr.5156\n10.1016/j.ejps.2011.08.025\n10.1161/01.HYP.32.6.958\n10.1186/s13045-014-0080-6\n10.1056/NEJMoa1311889\n10.1016/j.scr.2010.09.001\n10.1152/ajpheart.00733.2010\n10.1111/j.1549-8719.2009.00014.x\n10.1016/j.tcm.2004.10.003\n10.1111/1440-1681.12085\n10.1097/CRD.0b013e3181b18e03\n10.1016/j.bcp.2009.04.029\n10.1128/MCB.17.10.5719\n10.1152/ajplung.00378.2002\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.181123\n10.1152/ajpheart.00677.2004"}

The expression of SNHG6 in fetal cardiac tissues with VSD, mouse heart embryo development and the differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes were determined. Moreover, the effect of aberrant expression of SNHG6 on P19 cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation was further analyzed to explore the role of SNHG6 in affecting myocardial development. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanism between SNHG6 and miR-101 as well as between SNHG6 and activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway was investigated. SNHG6 was upregulated in fetal cardiac tissues with VSD, and decreased in the embryonic development of mice and differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of SNHG6 inhibited P19 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, as well as promoted cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, SNHG6 could negative regulate the expression of miR-101, and the effects of SNHG6 on the modulation of P19 cell function were through negative regulation of miR-101. In addition, overexpression of SNHG6 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which was reversed after overexpression of SNHG6 and miR-101 synchronously. Our study reveals that SNHG6 may contribute to VSD formation via negative regulation of miR-101 and activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.

However, due to their small size and low intracellular expression, visual monitoring of micropeptides in living cells is still a challenge. In this work, we have designed and synthesized an aptamer-based near-infrared fluorescence nanoprobe for fluorescence imaging of phospholamban (PLN), which is an intracellular micropeptide that affects calcium homeostasis, and is closely associated with human heart failure in the clinic. The nanoprobe could respond specifically to PLN with excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, good nuclease stability, and biocompatibility, and it was successfully applied for imaging of changes in PLN levels in cardiomyocytes and in frozen sections of heart tissues. Further combined with clinical myocardial biopsy, we believe that the developed nanoprobe should be of great significance in later molecular pathology study of heart failure, which may help with diagnosis of early heart failure in the future.

A response surface methodology approach to understanding the relationship between collagen concentration, fibrin concentration, seeding density, and cardiac purity found a statistically significant predictive model across three repeated studies that confirms that all of these factors contribute to tissue compaction.

However, its adoption as a safe and effective delivery vector for certain diseases relies on altering its tropism to deliver transgenes to desired cell populations. To this end, we have developed a protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that responds to elevated extracellular protease activity commonly found in diseased tissue microenvironments. The AAV9-based provector is initially inactive, but then it can be switched on by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9. Cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction reveal that the provector capsid is structurally similar to that of AAV9, with a flexible peptide insertion at the top of the 3-fold protrusions. In an in\u00a0vivo model of myocardial infarction (MI), the provector is able to deliver transgenes site specifically to high-MMP-activity regions of the damaged heart, with concomitant decreased delivery to many off-target organs, including the liver.

Seven cases of calcified emboli complicating endovascular procedures were identified: four of the CE were thought to be the cause of death due to fatal strokes (n=2) and fatal myocardial (n=1) and colonic infarction (n=1). The CE likely originated from calcified aortic valves and atherosclerotic aortic plaques. Histologic evidence of HPE was found in 23% (25/110) of cases; 54% (26/48) showed evidence of infarction in postprocedural imaging, with radiologic evidence of infarction in 32% (8/25) of cases with HPE histology. Endovascular aortic repair was associated with the greatest density/distribution of HPE. HPE material showed degradation with time and was often associated with an inflammatory response. HPE directly contributed to death in three cases.

{"title": "Regulation of cardiac transcription by thyroid hormone and Med13.", "abstract": "Thyroid hormone (TH) is a key regulator of transcriptional homeostasis in the heart. While hypothyroidism is known to result in adverse cardiac effects, the molecular mechanisms that modulate TH signaling are not completely understood. Mediator is a multiprotein complex that coordinates signal-dependent transcription factors with the basal transcriptional machinery to regulate gene expression. Mediator complex protein, Med13, represses numerous thyroid receptor (TR) response genes in the heart. Further, cardiac-specific overexpression of Med13 in mice that were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU), an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of the active TH, triiodothyronine (T3), resulted in resistance to PTU-dependent decreases in cardiac contractility. Therefore, these studies aimed to determine if Med13 is necessary for the cardiac response to hypothyroidism. Here we demonstrate that Med13 expression is induced in the hearts of mice with hypothyroidism. To elucidate the role of Med13 in regulating gene transcription in response to TH signaling in cardiac tissue, we utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to define the TH-dependent alterations in gene expression in wild-type mice or those with a cardiac-specific deletion in Med13 (Med13cKO). Mice were fed a diet of PTU to induce a hypothyroid state or normal chow for either 4 or 16\u202fweeks, and an additional group of mice on a PTU diet were treated acutely with T3 to re-establish a euthyroid state. Echocardiography revealed that wild-type mice had a decreased heart rate in response to PTU with a trend toward a reduced cardiac ejection fraction.

However, the molecular mechanism remains to be examined. The present study was designed to study the effects of simvastatin on cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic rats and to explore its potential mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into a control (Con) group, a streptozotocin (STZ) group, and a STZ+simvastatin (STZ+SIM) group. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. The protein expressions of p65, I\u03baB\u03b1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), calpain-1, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were examined by Western blot analysis. qPCR was used to detect the levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). RESULTS Simvastatin improved the cardiac hypertrophy of diabetic rats, as demonstrated by decreases in the ratios of left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) and heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) and by the downregulation of mRNA expression of BNP and ANP in the heart tissue. Simvastatin decreased the protein expressions of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, increased eNOS protein expression, and limited an increase in ROS levels in the heart tissue. Simvastatin increased IkBa protein expression in cytoplasm and inhibited the translocation of p65, the subunit of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to the nucleus from the cytoplasm of the heart tissue. Furthermore, simvastatin attenuated the activity of calpain and calpain-1 protein expression in heart tissue. CONCLUSIONS Simvastatin attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic rats, which might be due to the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation induced by calpain-1-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB.", "journal": "Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research", "date": "2019-02-16", "authors": ["QianQianHan", "QianQianLiu", "HuiZhang", "MeiliLu", "HongxinWang", "FutianTang", "YingjieZhang"], "doi": "10.12659/MSM.913244"}

The PVA scaffold was fabricated using a combination of gas foaming and freeze-drying processes that did not need any cross-linking agents. We obtained a biocompatible porous matrix with excellent mechanical properties. We measured the stress-strain curves of the PVA scaffolds and we showed that the elastic behavior is similar to that of the extracellular matrix of muscles. The SEM observations revealed that the scaffolds possess micro pores having diameters ranging from 10 \u03bcm to 370 \u03bcm that fit to the dimensions of the cells. A further purpose of this study was to test scaffolds ability to support human induced pluripotent stem cells growth and differentiation into cardiomyocytes. As the proliferation tests show, the number of live stem cells on the scaffold after 12 days was increased with respect to the initial number of cells, revealing the cytocompatibility of the substrate. In addition, the differentiated cells on the PVA scaffolds expressed anti-troponin T, a marker specific of the cardiac sarcomere.

{"title": "A Top-Down Proteomics Platform Coupling Serial Size Exclusion Chromatography and Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry.", "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) based top-down proteomics provides rich information about proteoforms arising from combinatorial amino acid sequence variations and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS affords ultrahigh resolving power and provides high-accuracy mass measurements, presenting a powerful tool for top-down MS characterization of proteoforms. However, the detection and characterization of large proteins from complex mixtures remain challenging due to the exponential decrease in S: N with increasing molecular weight (MW) and coeluting low-MW proteins; thus, size-based fractionation of complex protein mixtures prior to MS analysis is necessary. Here, we directly combine MS-compatible serial size exclusion chromatography (sSEC) fractionation with 12 T FT-ICR MS for targeted top-down characterization of proteins from complex mixtures extracted from human and swine heart tissue. Benefiting from the ultrahigh resolving power of FT-ICR, we isotopically resolved 31 distinct proteoforms (30-50 kDa) simultaneously in a single mass spectrum within a 100 m/ z window. Notably, within a 5 m/ z window, we obtained baseline isotopic resolution for 6 distinct large proteoforms (30-50 kDa). The ultrahigh resolving power of FT-ICR MS combined with sSEC fractionation enabled targeted top-down analysis of large proteoforms (>30 kDa) from the human heart proteome without extensive chromatographic separation or protein purification. Further separation of proteoforms inside the mass spectrometer (in-MS) allowed for isolation of individual proteoforms and targeted electron capture dissociation (ECD), yielding high sequence coverage. sSEC/FT-ICR ECD facilitated the identification and sequence characterization of important metabolic enzymes.

To date, the specific viral functions involved in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy remain unclear.\nTotal RNA from cardiac tissue of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was extracted, and sequences corresponding to the 5' termini of enterovirus RNAs were identified. After next-generation RNA sequencing, viral cDNA clones mimicking the enterovirus RNA sequences found in patient tissues were generated in vitro, and their replication and impact on host cell functions were assessed on primary human cardiac cells in culture.\nMajor enterovirus B populations characterized by 5' terminal genomic RNA deletions ranging from 17 to 50 nucleotides were identified either alone or associated with low proportions of intact 5' genomic termini. In situ hybridization and immunohistological assays detected these persistent genomes in clusters of cardiomyocytes. Transfection of viral RNA into primary human cardiomyocytes demonstrated that deleted forms of genomic RNAs displayed early replication activities in the absence of detectable viral plaque formation, whereas mixed deleted and complete forms generated particles capable of inducing cytopathic effects at levels distinct from those observed with full-length forms alone. Moreover, deleted or full-length and mixed forms of viral RNA were capable of directing translation and production of proteolytically active viral proteinase 2A in human cardiomyocytes.\nWe demonstrate that persistent viral forms are composed of B-type enteroviruses harboring a 5' terminal deletion in their genomic RNAs and that these viruses alone or associated with full-length populations of helper RNAs could impair cardiomyocyte functions by the proteolytic activity of viral proteinase 2A in cases of unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy.

Coupled with the typically small numbers of training examples, semi-supervised approaches for heterogeneous data are needed; however, current enhancer prediction methods are not designed to handle heterogeneous data in the semi-supervised paradigm.\nWe implemented a Dirichlet Process Heterogeneous Mixture model that infers Gaussian, Bernoulli and Poisson distributions over features. We derived a novel variational inference algorithm to handle semi-supervised learning tasks where certain observations are forced to cluster together. We applied this model to enhancer candidates in mouse heart tissues based on heterogeneous features. We constrained a small number of known active enhancers to appear in the same cluster, and 47 additional regions clustered with them. Many of these are located near heart-specific genes.

In DCM, cardiac fibrosis is the main cause of heart failure. Although it is well-established that the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway plays a part in inducing cardiac fibrosis in DCM, details of the molecular mechanism involved remain elusive. Therefore, it is crucial to study the gene reg;ulation of key signaling effectors in DCM-associated cardiac fibrosis. A recently emerged hotspot in the field of gene regulation is the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Recent evidence indicates that lncRNAs play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, in DCM, the function of these regulatory RNAs have not been studied in depth. In this study, we identified a conserved cardiac-specific lncRNA named colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (Crnde). By analyzing 376 human heart tissues, it was found that Crnde expression is negatively correlated with that of cardiac fibrosis marker genes. Moreover, Crnde expression was shown to be enriched in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Overexpression of Crnde attenuated cardiac fibrosis and enhanced cardiac function in mice with DCM. Further, in vitro experiments showed that Crnde negatively regulates the myofibroblast differentiation of CFs. The expression of Crnde was activated by SMAD family member 3 (Smad3), shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanism. Interestingly, Crnde also inhibited the transcriptional activation of Smad3 on target genes, thereby inhibiting the expression of myofibroblastic marker genes in CFs.

InitiallyTTX was associated with human food intoxications in Japan, but nowadays, concerns about thehuman health risks posed by TTX have increased in Europe after the identification of the toxin infish, marine gastropods, and bivalves captured in European waters. Even when TTX monitoring isnot currently performed in Europe, an acute oral no observable effect level (NOAEL) of 75 \u03bcg/kghas been recently established but, to date, no studies evaluating the chronic oral toxicity of TTXhave been released, even when EFSA has highlighted the need for them. Thus, in this work, thechronic effects of low oral TTX doses (below the acute lethal dose 50) were evaluated followinginternationally adopted guidelines.

{"title": "Simultaneous Electrical and Mechanical Stimulation to Enhance Cells' Cardiomyogenic Potential.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in developed countries. Consequently, the demand for effective cardiac cell therapies has motivated researchers in the stem cell and bioengineering fields to develop in vitro high-fidelity human myocardium for both basic research and clinical applications. However, the immature phenotype of cardiac cells is a limitation on obtaining tissues that functionally mimic the adult myocardium, which is mainly characterized by mechanical and electrical signals. Thus, the purpose of this protocol is to prepare and mature the target cell population through electromechanical stimulation, recapitulating physiological parameters. Cardiac tissue engineering is evolving toward more biological approaches, and strategies based on biophysical stimuli, thus, are gaining momentum. The device developed for this purpose is unique and allows individual or simultaneous electrical and mechanical stimulation, carefully characterized and validated. In addition, although the methodology has been optimized for this stimulator and a specific cell population, it can easily be adapted to other devices and cell lines. The results here offer evidence of the increased cardiac commitment of the cell population after electromechanical stimulation. Electromechanically stimulated cells show an increased expression of main cardiac markers, including early, structural, and calcium-regulating genes.

MicroRNA-23b (miR-23b) is a multifunctional miRNA that is considered to regulate immunosuppression in sepsis. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of miR-23b on cardiomyopathy induced by sepsis and to explore the potential mechanism involved. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and the level of miR-23b at different time points was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Then, we overexpressed miR-23b in vivo and in vitro. The rats were subjected to CLP 7\u00a0days after transfection. Cardiac function, inflammatory response, and heart tissues were examined 3\u00a0days thereafter. In an in vitro experiment, H9C2 cardiomyoblasts were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after transfection of miR-23b, following which apoptosis and the level of NF-\u03baB were analyzed. The expression of miR-23b was upregulated during polymicrobial sepsis, and transfection of miR-23b lentivirus improved the outcome of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by attenuating inflammatory responses and protecting against histopathological damage. In in vitro experiments, elevated miR-23b inhibited excessive apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, which may be because activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was inhibited by the decreased levels of TRAF6 and IKK\u03b2. Therefore, miR-23b improved sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by attenuating the inflammatory response, suppressing apoptosis, and preventing NF-\u03baB activation via targeted inhibition of TRAF6 and I\u03ba\u03baB. These results indicated that miR-23b may represent a novel therapeutic approach for clinical treatment of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "Inflammation", "date": "2019-02-09", "authors": ["ChaoCao", "YanZhang", "YanfenChai", "LijunWang", "ChengfenYin", "SongtaoShou", "HengJin"], "doi": "10.1007/s10753-019-00958-7"}

{"title": "Role of heat shock proteins 70/90 in exercise physiology and exercise immunology and their diagnostic potential in sports.", "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones facilitating the unfolding or folding of secondary structures of proteins, their client proteins, in cellular stress situations. Various internal and external physiological and mechanical stress factors induce a homeostatic imbalance, followed by an increased expression of HSP70 and HSP90. Exercise is a stress factor, too, and its cumulative physiological perturbation manifests at a cellular level by threatening the protein homeostasis of various cell types. Consequently, an increase of HSP70/90 was described in plasma and mononuclear cells and various organs and tissues, such as muscle, liver, cardiac tissue, and brain, after an acute bout of exercise. The specific response of HSP70/90 seems to be strongly related to the modality of exercise, with several dependent factors such as duration, intensity, exercise type, subjects' training status, and environmental factors, e.g., temperature. It is suggested that HSP70/90 play a major role in immune regulation and cell protection during exercise and in the efficiency of regeneration and reparation processes. During long-term training, HSP70/90 are involved in preconditioning and adaptation processes that might also be important for disease prevention and therapy. With regard to their highly sensitive and individual response to specific exercise and training modalities, this review discusses whether and how HSP70 and HSP90 can be applied as biomarkers for monitoring exercise and training.", "journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "date": "2019-02-08", "authors": ["KarstenKr\u00fcger", "ThomasReichel", "CarstenZeilinger"], "doi": "10.1152/japplphysiol.01052.2018"}
{"title": "Critical inflammatory mechanisms underlying arrhythmias.", "abstract": "During the past few decades, cardiovascular research has increasingly focused on systemic inflammatory mechanisms, particularly in the field of atherosclerosis but also in association with cardiac arrhythmogenesis. Objective inflammatory markers including C\u2011reactive protein and cytokines, also called \"biomarkers,\" seem to serve as predictors of onset and prognosis of cardiac arrhythmias. This review gives an overview of potential mechanisms underlying inflammatory processes and arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, which is the most common sustained arrhythmia in daily clinical routine. The association between inflammatory pathways and cardiac arrhythmia is highly complex and includes direct as well as indirect pathways. While past research into arrhythmia focused on fibrosis, altered action potential properties, and ischemia, novel concepts include coagulation and inflammation in cardiac tissue. The underlying mechanisms are altered electrophysiological properties, including ion channel disturbance, early and late afterdepolarizations, as well as enhanced fibrosis and structural remodeling in cardiomyopathies. These pathophysiological factors favor the occurrence of ectopic pacemakers as well as re-entry tachycardia. Further studies are essential to better understand the main inflammatory signal cascades and the exact proarrhythmic effect of interacting key mediators.

Recent work, however, has shown that pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes may self-align over long periods of time. To determine how the degree of biomaterial substrate anisotropy impacts differentiating cardiomyocyte structure and function, we differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes on nonaligned, semialigned, and aligned fibrous substrates and evaluated cell alignment, contractile displacement, and calcium transient synchronicity over time. Although cardiomyocyte gene expression was not affected by fiber alignment, we observed gradient- and threshold-based differences in cardiomyocyte alignment and function. Cardiomyocyte alignment increased with the degree of fiber alignment in a gradient-based manner at early time points and in a threshold-based manner at later time points. Calcium transient synchronization tightly followed cardiomyocyte alignment behavior, allowing highly anisotropic biomaterials to drive calcium transient synchronization within 8 days, while such synchronized cardiomyocyte behavior required 20 days of culture on nonaligned biomaterials. In contrast, cardiomyocyte contractile displacement had no directional preference on day 8 yet became anisotropic in the direction of fiber alignment on aligned fibers by day 20. Biomaterial anisotropy impact on differentiating cardiomyocyte structure and function is temporally dependent.

{"title": "Aldosterone Modulates the Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Signaling in Male Mice.", "abstract": "Both mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and aldosterone are implicated in the development of cardiovascular and renal disease. However, the interaction between aldosterone and the mTOR pathway is unknown. We hypothesized the following: that (i) increased aldosterone will modulate the activity of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 molecular pathways in the heart and kidney; (ii) a physiologic increase in aldosterone will affect these pathways differently than a pathophysiologic one; and (iii) the changes in the mTOR level/activity will differ between the heart and kidney. In both kidney and heart tissues, phosphorylation of mTOR is significantly decreased when aldosterone levels are physiologically increased (by dietary sodium restriction), followed by a decrease in phosphorylated p70S6K1 in cardiac, but not renal, tissue. Sirtuin 1, an epigenetic modulator, is decreased in the heart but increased in the kidney. Conversely, pathophysiologic aldosterone levels (an infusion for 3 weeks) had divergent effects on phosphorylated mTOR and the downstream substrates of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in cardiac and renal tissues. Increased aldosterone levels significantly alter mTOR activity in the heart and kidney. In the kidney, substantial differences were noted if the increase was produced physiologically vs pathophysiologically, suggesting that mTOR activity, in part, may mediate aldosterone-induced renal damage. Thus, modulating mTOR activity may reduce aldosterone-dependent renal damage similar to mineralocorticoid receptor blockade but potentially with less adverse side effects.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2019-02-07", "authors": ["Danielle LBrooks", "Amanda EGarza", "Isis AKatayama", "Jose RRomero", "Gail KAdler", "Luminita HPojoga", "Gordon HWilliams"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2018-00989"}

{"title": "T cell checkpoint regulators in the heart.", "abstract": "T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses in the heart are potentially dangerous because they can interfere with the electromechanical function. Furthermore, the myocardium has limited regenerative capacity to repair damage caused by effector T cells. Myocardial T cell responses are normally suppressed by multiple mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. T cell inhibitory molecules, so called immune checkpoints, limit the activation and effector function of heart antigen-reactive T cells that escape deletion during development in the thymus. Programmed cell protein death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) are checkpoint molecules homologous to the costimulatory receptor CD28, and they work to block activating signals from the T cell antigen receptor and CD28. Nonetheless, PD-1 and CTLA-4 function in different ways and at different steps in a T cell response to antigen. Studies in mice have established that genetic deficiencies of checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and lymphocyte activation gene-3, result in enhanced risk of autoimmune T cell-mediated myocarditis and increased pathogenicity of heart antigen-specific effector T cells. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway appears to be particularly important in cardiac protection from T cells. PD-L1 is markedly up-regulated on myocardial cells by interferon-gamma secreted by T cells and PD-1 or PD-L1 deficiency synergizes with other defects in immune regulation in promoting myocarditis. Consistent with these studies, myocarditis has emerged as a serious adverse reaction of cancer therapies that target checkpoint molecules to enhance anti-tumour T cell responses. Histopathology and immunohistochemical analyses of myocardial tissue from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-treated patients echoes findings in checkpoint-deficient mice. Many questions about myocarditis in the setting of cancer immunotherapy still need to be answered, including the nature of the target antigens, genetic risk factors, and variations in the disease with combined therapies. Addressing these questions will require further immunological analyses of blood and heart tissue from patients treated with ICB.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2019-02-06", "authors": ["NirGrabie", "Andrew HLichtman", "RobertPadera"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvz025"}

{"title": "Therapeutic potential of menstrual blood-derived endometrial stem cells in cardiac diseases.", "abstract": "Despite significant developments in medical and surgical strategies, cardiac diseases remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Numerous studies involving preclinical and clinical trials have confirmed that stem cell transplantation can help improve cardiac function and regenerate damaged cardiac tissue, and stem cells isolated from bone marrow, heart tissue, adipose tissue and umbilical cord are the primary candidates for transplantation. During the past decade, menstrual blood-derived endometrial stem cells (MenSCs) have gradually become a promising alternative for stem cell-based therapy due to their comprehensive advantages, which include their ability to be periodically and non-invasively collected, their abundant source material, their ability to be regularly donated, their superior proliferative capacity and their ability to be used for autologous transplantation. MenSCs have shown positive therapeutic potential for the treatment of various diseases. Therefore, aside from a brief introduction of the biological characteristics of MenSCs, this review focuses on the progress being made in evaluating the functional improvement of damaged cardiac tissue after MenSC transplantation through preclinical and clinical studies. Based on published reports, we conclude that the paracrine effect, transdifferentiation and immunomodulation by MenSC promote both regeneration of damaged myocardium and improvement of cardiac function.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "date": "2019-02-06", "authors": ["YanliLiu", "RongchengNiu", "WenzhongLi", "JuntangLin", "ChristofStamm", "GustavSteinhoff", "NanMa"], "doi": "10.1007/s00018-019-03019-2"}

In vitro, the hESC-ECs lining the luminal walls readily sprout and anastomose with de novo-formed endothelial tubes in the matrix under flow. When implanted on infarcted rat hearts, the perfusable microvessel grafts integrate with coronary vasculature to a greater degree than non-perfusable self-assembled constructs at 5 days post-implantation. Optical microangiography imaging reveal that perfusable grafts have 6-fold greater vascular density, 2.5-fold higher vascular velocities and >20-fold higher volumetric perfusion rates. Implantation of perfusable grafts containing additional hESC-derived cardiomyocytes show higher cardiomyocyte and vascular density. Thus, pre-patterned vascular networks enhance vascular remodeling and accelerate coronary perfusion, potentially supporting cardiac tissues after implantation.

{"title": "Adiponectin deficiency has no effect in murine autoimmune myocarditis.", "abstract": "Adiponectin is a hormone that together with its receptors modulates a number of metabolic processes including gluconeogenesis and lipid catabolism. It belongs to the C1QTNF (complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein) family, which has a variety of members with high amino acid sequence homology and overlapping functions. Concentration of adiponectin in blood is inversely correlated with body fat percentage and cardiac risk factors like blood pressure and CRP (C-reactive protein) level. Studies have identified the existence of a cardiac adiponectin system. However, little is known about the role of this system in the pathogenesis of autoimmune myocarditis. Thus, we have studied the involvement of adiponectin in the development of this autoimmune disorder in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM).\nAdiponectin knockout (ko) and wild type (wt) mice were immunized with cardiac troponin I (cTnI) to induce an EAM. To determine the severity of myocardial damage, inflammation and fibrosis were scored after HE and Afog staining and high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) level was measured. To detect if changes in specific inflammatory cell numbers could be observed between the genotypes, we performed immunohistochemical staining to detect T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages. The level of the humoral immune response was determined through the measurement of cTnI-specific serum IgG autoantibodies. Relative mRNA expression of different cytokines, C1QTNF family members and adiponectin receptors in the heart tissue was analyzed with qPCR.\nAnimals immunized with cTnI developed autoimmune myocarditis with a significant deterioration of cardiac parameters compared to the corresponding control group. The adiponectin ko group immunized with cTnI showed a tendency towards increased inflammation, fibrosis, heart-to-body-weight ratio, infiltration pattern of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and macrophages, hsTnT concentration, humoral immune response and mRNA expression of interleukin 6 in the heart tissue and decreased weight gain compared to the wt group immunized with cTnI. However, the difference to the wt group treated with cTnI was not significant. The analysis of cardiac mRNA expression of adiponectin receptors and four C1QTNF family members, most suitable for fulfilling the functions of adiponectin in adiponectin ko mice, did not show any significant differences between adiponectin ko and wt group at all.\nOur study reveals that the absence of adiponectin did not lead to a significantly increased impairment of cardiac function and was also unlikely to be compensated by its receptors or other C1QTNF family members in the murine model of EAM.

{"title": "Decellularized neonatal cardiac extracellular matrix prevents widespread ventricular remodeling in adult mammals after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Heart disease remains a leading killer in western society and irreversibly impacts the lives of millions of patients annually. While adult mammals do not possess the ability to regenerate functional cardiac tissue, neonatal mammals are capable of robust cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration within a week of birth. Given this change in regenerative function through development, the extracellular matrix (ECM) from adult tissues may not be conducive to promoting cardiac regeneration, although conventional ECM therapies rely exclusively on adult-derived tissues. Therefore the potential of ECM derived from neonatal mouse hearts (nmECM) to prevent adverse ventricular remodeling in adults was investigated using an in vivo model of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Following a single administration of nmECM, we observed a significant improvement in heart function while adult heart-derived ECM (amECM) did not improve these parameters. Treatment with nmECM limits scar expansion in the left ventricle and promotes revascularization of the injured region. Furthermore, nmECM induced expression of the ErbB2 receptor, simulating a neonatal-like environment and promoting neuregulin-1 associated cardiac function. Inhibition of the ErbB2 receptor effectively prevents these actions, suggesting its role in the context of nmECM as a therapy. This study shows the potential of a neonatal-derived biological material in vivo, diverting from the conventional use of adult-derived ECM therapies in research and the clinic. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The of use extracellular matrix biomaterials to aid tissue repair has been previously reported in many forms of injury. The majority of ECM studies to date utilized ECM derived from adult tissues that are not able to fully regenerate functional tissue. In contrast, this study tests the ability of ECM derived from a regenerative organ, the neonatal heart, to stimulate functional cardiac repair after MI. This study is the first to test its potential in vivo. Our results indicate that extracellular factors present in the neonatal environment can be used to alter the healing response in adults, and we have identified the role of ErbB2 in neonatal ECM-based cardiac repair.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2019-02-03", "authors": ["ZhouguangWang", "Daniel WLong", "YanHuang", "William C WChen", "KangKim", "YadongWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2019.01.062\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1038/labinvest.2017.100\n10.4103/0975-7406.80761\n10.3390/bioengineering5020028\n10.4172/2157-7633.1000270\n10.1001/jamacardio.2016.2750\n10.1016/J.HEALUN.2014.10.008\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3005503\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.06.045\n10.1159/000331400\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.07.039\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.525436\n10.1016/J.VASCN.2005.10.005\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031542\n10.1016/j.devcel.2016.01.018\n10.1126/science.1077857\n10.1016/j.cbpc.2014.02.002\n10.1002/jez.1401870208\n10.1126/science.1200708\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa5171\n10.1093/cvr/cvx001\n10.1038/nature22978\n10.1093/cvr/cvv190\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.009\n10.1038/ncb3149\n10.1152/ajpheart.00063.2012\n10.3892/mmr.2014.2109\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.028252\n10.1242/dev.102798\n10.1371/journal.pone.0192238\n10.1073/pnas.1208863110\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2016.01.026\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00365\n10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.037\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.01.057\n10.1002/stem.1285\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.08.050\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207207\n10.1371/journal.pone.0039066\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.019\n10.1109/58.285465\n10.1109/58.741427\n10.1080/15384101.2015.1063292\n10.1002/jbm.a.36557\n10.1016/J.BIOMATERIALS.2014.01.081\n10.1096/fj.10-161497\n10.1089/ten.tea.2011.0738\n10.1016/J.ACTBIO.2015.09.038\n10.1089/biores.2016.0021\n10.1002/jbm.b.30170\n10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.03.005\n10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0768\n10.1016/j.jacbts.2017.05.005\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.06.056\n10.1016/j.jacc.2011.10.888\n10.1016/j.matbio.2013.11.001\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.021\n10.1016/j.actbio.2012.06.030\n10.1161/01.CIRCULATIONAHA.105.523795\n10.1172/JCI72181\n10.4137/CMC.S33164\n10.1038/nrc2106"}

{"title": "SarcTrack.", "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing provide unparalleled opportunities to study cardiac biology and disease. However, sarcomeres, the fundamental units of myocyte contraction, are immature and nonlinear in hiPSC-CMs, which technically challenge accurate functional interrogation of contractile parameters in beating cells. Furthermore, existing analysis methods are relatively low-throughput, indirectly assess contractility, or only assess well-aligned sarcomeres found in mature cardiac tissues.\nWe aimed to develop an analysis platform that directly, rapidly, and automatically tracks sarcomeres in beating cardiomyocytes. The platform should assess sarcomere content, contraction and relaxation parameters, and beat rate.\nWe developed SarcTrack, a MatLab software that monitors fluorescently tagged sarcomeres in hiPSC-CMs. The algorithm determines sarcomere content, sarcomere length, and returns rates of sarcomere contraction and relaxation. By rapid measurement of hundreds of sarcomeres in each hiPSC-CM, SarcTrack provides large data sets for robust statistical analyses of multiple contractile parameters. We validated SarcTrack by analyzing drug-treated hiPSC-CMs, confirming the contractility effects of compounds that directly activate (CK-1827452) or inhibit (MYK-461) myosin molecules or indirectly alter contractility (verapamil and propranolol). SarcTrack analysis of hiPSC-CMs carrying a heterozygous truncation variant in the myosin-binding protein C ( MYBPC3) gene, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, recapitulated seminal disease phenotypes including cardiac hypercontractility and diminished relaxation, abnormalities that normalized with MYK-461 treatment.\nSarcTrack provides a direct and efficient method to quantitatively assess sarcomere function. By improving existing contractility analysis methods and overcoming technical challenges associated with functional evaluation of hiPSC-CMs, SarcTrack enhances translational prospects for sarcomere-regulating therapeutics and accelerates interrogation of human cardiac genetic variants.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2019-02-01", "authors": ["Christopher NToepfer", "ArunSharma", "MarceloCicconet", "Amanda CGarfinkel", "MichaelM\u00fccke", "MerajNeyazi", "Jon A LWillcox", "RadhikaAgarwal", "ManuelSchmid", "JyotiRao", "JourdanEwoldt", "OlivierPourqui\u00e9", "AnantChopra", "Christopher SChen", "Jonathan GSeidman", "Christine ESeidman"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314505"}
{"title": "Low Molecular Mass Myocardial Hyaluronan in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "During the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart returns to fetal energy metabolism where cells utilize more glucose instead of fatty acids as a source of energy. Metabolism of glucose can increase synthesis of the extracellular glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan, which has been shown to be involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate hyaluronan metabolism in cardiac tissue from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in relation to cardiac growth. NMR and qRT-PCR analysis of human cardiac tissue from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and healthy control hearts showed dysregulated glucose and hyaluronan metabolism in the patients. Gas phase electrophoresis revealed a higher amount of low molecular mass hyaluronan and larger cardiomyocytes in cardiac tissue from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Histochemistry showed high concentrations of hyaluronan around individual cardiomyocytes in hearts from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients. Experimentally, we could also observe accumulation of low molecular mass hyaluronan in cardiac hypertrophy in a rat model. In conclusion, the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with increased glucose metabolism affected both hyaluronan molecular mass and amount.

The molecular regulators that drive this process in the diabetic heart are still unknown.\nReal-time (RT) PCR analysis was performed to determine the expression of cardiac specific microRNA-208a in right atrial appendage (RAA) and left ventricular (LV) biopsy tissues collected from diabetic and non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. To determine the time-dependent changes, cardiac tissue were collected from type 2 diabetic mice at different age groups.

{"title": "Heart Rhythm Insights Into Structural Remodeling in Atrial Tissue: Timed Automata Approach.", "abstract": "The heart rhythm of a person following heart transplantation (HTX) is assumed to display an intrinsic cardiac rhythm because it is significantly less influenced by the autonomic nervous system-the main source of heart rate variability in healthy people. Therefore, such a rhythm provides evidence for arrhythmogenic processes developing, usually silently, in the cardiac tissue. A model is proposed to simulate alterations in the cardiac tissue and to observe the effects of these changes on the resulting heart rhythm. The hybrid automata framework used makes it possible to represent reliably and simulate efficiently both the electrophysiology of a cardiac cell and the tissue organization. The curve fitting method used in the design of the hybrid automaton cycle follows the well-recognized physiological phases of the atrial myocyte membrane excitation. Moreover, knowledge of the complex architecture of the right atrium, the ability of the almost free design of intercellular connections makes the automata approach the only one possible. Two particular aspects are investigated: impairment of the impulse transmission between cells and structural changes in intercellular connections. The first aspect models the observed fatigue of cells due to specific cardiac tissue diseases. The second aspect simulates the increase in collagen deposition with aging. Finally, heart rhythms arising from the model are validated with the sinus heart rhythms recorded in HTX patients. The modulation in the impairment of the impulse transmission between cells reveals qualitatively the abnormally high heart rate variability observed in patients living long after HTX.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2019-01-30", "authors": ["DanutaMakowiec", "JoannaWdowczyk", "Zbigniew RStruzik"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01859\n10.1161/01.RES.68.4.1138\n10.1016/j.tcs.2009.12.019\n10.1038/ncomms1705\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.028105\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.11.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0130252\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.028104\n10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.05.008\n10.1114/1.1553455\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.688889\n10.1063/1.166311\n10.4249/scholarpedia.1868\n10.1016/S0006-3495(61)86902-6\n10.1016/j.joa.2016.05.002\n10.22489/CinC.2016.052-487\n10.1063/1.4999605\n10.1137/0134040\n10.1140/epjst/e2012-01695-x\n10.1109/LICS.1996.561342\n10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00226-2\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000147231.69595.D3\n10.1016/B978-1-4557-2856-5.00028-5\n10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161241\n10.1371/journal.pone.0183727\n10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02699.x\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.172403\n10.1371/journal.pone.0112547\n10.1098/rsif.2016.0968\n10.1161/01.RES.74.6.1071\n10.1140/epjb/e2006-00008-2\n10.5506/APhysPolBSupp.7.347\n10.1016/j.chaos.2016.03.024\n10.3389/fphys.2015.00201\n10.1103/PhysRevE.94.042401\n10.1186/1471-2105-11-178\n10.1113/JP271671\n10.1088/0967-3334/37/5/R46\n10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288235\n10.1161/CIRCEP.107.754564\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303466\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002061\n10.1007/s10877-013-9429-6\n10.1136/heart.88.4.406\n10.1136/hrt.2003.031542\n10.1016/j.nahs.2012.05.003\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.961524\n10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043\n10.1161/JAHA.112.001461\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302240\n10.3389/fphys.2016.00079\n10.3389/fphys.2018.00274\n10.1049/iet-syb:20070001\n10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259294"}

Angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) levels were significantly higher at day 17 when compared to baseline in atrium, whereas, in ventricle, ACE2 levels were significantly higher in 13 dpi when compared to baseline. In response to l-NAME treatment, atrium tissue levels of ACE1 were significantly reduced in treated animals at day 17, while Angiotensin-(1-7) concentration in atrium significantly increased in this group at the same time-point. No changes were detected in RAS components in the ventricle. ACE2 levels in Soleus muscle were significantly reduced in treated animals at day 13.

{"title": "Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Causes Adverse Cardiac Extracellular Matrix Changes and Dysfunction in Neonatal Mice.", "abstract": "Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most severe condition of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and is associated with congenital heart defects. However, more subtle defects such as ventricular wall thinning and cardiac compliance may be overlooked in FASD. Our studies focus on the role of cardiac fibroblasts in the neonatal heart, and how they are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). We hypothesize that PAE affects fibroblast function contributing to dysregulated collagen synthesis, which leads to cardiac dysfunction. To investigate these effects, pregnant C57/BL6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2.9\u00a0g EtOH/kg dose to achieve a blood alcohol content of approximately 0.35 on gestation days 6.75 and 7.25. Pups were sacrificed on neonatal day 5 following echocardiography measurements of left ventricular (LV) chamber dimension and function. Hearts were used for primary cardiac fibroblast isolation or protein expression analysis. PAE animals had thinner ventricular walls than saline exposed animals, which was associated with increased LV wall stress and decreased ejection fraction. In isolated fibroblasts, PAE decreased collagen I/III ratio and increased gene expression of profibrotic markers, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and lysyl oxidase. Notch1 signaling was assessed as a possible mechanism for fibroblast activation, and indicated that gene expression of Notch1 receptor and downstream Hey1 transcription factor were increased.

{"title": "Ebselen protects rat hearts against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Ebselen is an organoselenium compound that has demonstrated potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in previous studies. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ebselen on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in a rat model and to elucidate the related mechanisms. Myocardial infarct size was assessed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Myocardial injury was evaluated according to the histopathological and ultrastructural alterations of rat hearts and the serum activity levels of cardiac enzymes, including creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected using the terminal dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay. In addition, the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was measured using western blot analysis. In heart tissue specimens the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) were also detected. The results indicated that ebselen reduced I/R-induced increase in myocardial infarct size and prevented the I/R-induced decreases in ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Further of note, ebselen improved I/R-induced rat heart injury. This was indicated by attenuation of histological and ultrastructural changes; reduction of serum CK, CK-MB and LDH activity levels; and decreased cell apoptosis on TUNEL staining, which was verified by decreased expression of cleaved (C)-Caspase-8, C-Caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein and C-PARP, and increased expression of Bcl-2. Additionally, SOD and GPx activity levels were significantly higher, while MDA and PC levels were significantly lower in the ebselen + I/R group compared with in the I/R group. In conclusion, the present results suggested that ebselen serves an important role in protecting against myocardial I/R injury.

{"title": "Functional biological pacemaker generation by T-Box18 protein expression via stem cell and viral delivery approaches in a murine model of complete heart block.", "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, the available options are still limited and associated with some complications. Induction of biological pacemakers via Tbx18 gene insertion in the heart tissue has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiac arrhythmia. Following a previous in vitro study reporting the production of Tbx18-expressing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), we aimed to investigate the efficacy of these engineered cells to generate pacemaker rhythms in a murine model of complete heart block. We also attempted to generate a functional pacemaker by Tbx18 overexpression in native cardiac cells of rat heart. The hiPSC-derived pacemaker cells were produced by lentiviral delivery of Tbx18 gene to stem cells during a small molecule-based differentiation process. In the present study, 16 male albino Wistar rats were randomly assigned to Tbx18-lentivirus (n\u2009=\u20094) and Tbx18-pacemaker cells (n\u2009=\u20094) administered via injection into the left ventricular anterolateral wall. The control rats received GFP-lentiviruses (n\u2009=\u20094) and GFP-pacemaker cells (n\u2009=\u20094). Fourteen days after the injection, the rats were sacrificed and analyzed by electrocardiography (ECG) recording using a Langendorff-perfused heart model following complete heart block induced by hypokalemia and crashing. Immunofluorescence staining was used to investigate the expression of Tbx18, HCN4 and connexin 43 (Cx43) proteins in Tbx18-delivered cells of heart tissues. The heart rate was significantly reduced after complete heart block in all of the experimental rats (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Heart beating in the Tbx18-transduced hearts was slower compared with rats receiving Tbx18-pacemaker cells (P\u2009=\u20090.04). The duration of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was higher in the lentiviral Tbx18 group compared with the GFP-injected controls (P\u2009=\u20090.02) and the Tbx18-pacemaker cell group (P\u2009=\u20090.02). The ECG recording data showed spontaneous pacemaker rhythms in both intervention groups with signal propagation in Tbx18-transduced ventricles. Immunostaining results confirmed the overexpression of HCN4 and downregulation of Cx43 as a result of the expression of the Tbx18 gene and spontaneously contracting myocyte formation. We confirmed the formation of a functional pacemaker after introduction of Tbx18 via cell and gene therapy strategies. Although the pacemaker activity was better in gene-received hearts since there were longer VF duration and signal propagation from the injection site, more data should be gathered from the long-term activity of such pacemakers in different hosts.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2019-01-25", "authors": ["Armita MahdaviGorabi", "SaeidehHajighasemi", "VahidKhori", "MasoudSoleimani", "MaryamRajaei", "ShahramRabbani", "AmirAtashi", "AliGhiaseddin", "Ali KazemiSaeid", "HosseinAhmadi Tafti", "AmirhosseinSahebkar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2019.01.034"}
{"title": "New insights on the cardiac safety factor: Unraveling the relationship between conduction velocity and robustness of propagation.", "abstract": "Cardiac conduction disturbances are linked with arrhythmia development. The concept of safety factor (SF) has been derived to describe the robustness of conduction, but the usefulness of this metric has been constrained by several limitations. For example, due to the difficulty of measuring the necessary input variables, SF calculations have only been applied to synthetic data. Moreover, quantitative validation of SF is lacking; specifically, the practical meaning of particular SF values is unclear, aside from the fact that propagation failure (i.e., conduction block) is characterized by SF\u202f<\u202f1. This study aims to resolve these limitations for our previously published SF formulation and explore its relationship to relevant electrophysiological properties of cardiac tissue. First, HL-1 cardiomyocyte monolayers were grown on multi-electrode arrays and the robustness of propagation was estimated using extracellular potential recordings. SF values reconstructed purely from experimental data were largely between 1 and 5 (up to 89.1% of sites characterized). This range is consistent with values derived from synthetic data, proving that the formulation is sound and its applicability is not limited to analysis of computational models. Second, for simulations conducted in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional tissue blocks, we calculated true SF values at locations surrounding the site of current injection for sub- and supra-threshold stimuli and found that they differed from values estimated by our SF formulation by <10%. Finally, we examined SF dynamics under conditions relevant to arrhythmia development in order to provide physiological insight. Our analysis shows that reduced conduction velocity (\u0398) caused by impaired intrinsic cell-scale excitability (e.g., due to sodium current a loss-of-function mutation) is associated with less robust conduction (i.e., lower SF); however, intriguingly, \u0398 variability resulting from modulation of tissue scale conductivity has no effect on SF. These findings are supported by analytic derivation of the relevant relationships from first principles. We conclude that our SF formulation, which can be applied to both experimental and synthetic data, produces values that vary linearly with the excess charge needed for propagation.

The pathophysiological role of galectin-3 in acute myocarditis following viral infection is not fully understood. The goal of this study is to determine the cardiac localization and the time-course of galectin-3 expression in heart failure after viral inoculation with EMCV. At 12, 24, 48, 96 hours, 7 and 10 days after intraperitoneal EMCV inoculation, animals were examined histologically and analyzed for the expression of galectin-3 and Iba1. Galectin-3 was up-regulated in degenerated fibrotic lesions of cardiac tissues 96 hours after viral inoculation and were followed by myocardial fibrosis. At the same time, Iba1 positive macrophages were observed within the inflammatory sites. A time-course correlation between the number of galectin-3 positive cells and the cardiac area of degenerated fibrotic lesions was detected-serum galectin-3 increased at 96 hours and correlated well with the number of cardiac galectin-3 positive cells.

They are a model of intermediate complexity as they retain the native multicellularity, architecture, and physiology of the heart, while their thinness ensures adequate oxygen and metabolic substrate diffusion in vitro. Myocardial slices can be produced from a variety of animal models and human biopsies, thus providing a representative human in vitro platform for translational cardiovascular research. In this review, we compare myocardial slices to other in vitro models and highlight some of the unique advantages provided by this platform. Additionally, we discuss the work performed in our laboratory to optimize myocardial slice preparation methodology, which resulted in highly viable myocardial slices from both large and small mammalian hearts with only 2-3% cardiomyocyte damage and preserved structure and function. Applications of myocardial slices span both basic and translational cardiovascular science.

{"title": "Bridged Hybrid Monolithic Column Coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry for Top-Down Proteomics.", "abstract": "Top-down mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful tool for comprehensive characterization of intact proteins. However, because of the high complexity of the proteome, highly effective separation of intact proteins from complex mixtures prior to MS analysis remains challenging. Monolithic columns have shown great promise for intact protein separation due to their high permeability, low backpressure, and fast mass transfer. Herein, for the first time, we developed bridged hybrid bis(triethoxysilyl)ethylene (BTSEY) monolith with C8 functional groups (C8@BTSEY) for highly effective protein separation and coupled it to high-resolution MS for identification of intact proteins from complex protein mixtures. We have optimized mobile phase conditions of our monolith-based reverse-phase chromatography (RPC) for online liquid chromatography (LC)-MS analysis and evaluated separation reproducibility of the C8@BTSEY column. We further assessed the chromatographic performance of this column by separating a complex protein mixture extracted from swine heart tissue. Using our monolithic column (i.d. 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 35 cm), we separated over 300 proteoforms (up to 104 kDa) from 360 ng of protein mixture in an 80 min one-dimensional (1D) LC run.

{"title": "Clinical Overview of Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus as Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation and Sudden Cardiac Death.", "abstract": "The epidemics of obesity and diabetes mellitus are associated with an increased incidence of both atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Obesity and DM are known to have adverse effects on cardiac structure and function. The pathologic mechanisms are thought to involve cardiac tissue remodeling, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Clinical data suggest that left atrial size, epicardial fat pad thickness, and other modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, glycemic control, and obstructive sleep apnea may mediate the association with AF. Data from human atrial tissue biopsies demonstrate alterations in atrial lipid content and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. With respect to ventricular arrhythmias, abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction are commonly observed in obese and diabetic humans. The increased risk of SCD in this population may also be related to excessive cardiac lipid deposition and insulin resistance. While nutritional interventions have had limited success, perhaps due to poor long-term compliance, weight loss and improved cardiorespiratory fitness may reduce the frequency and severity of AF.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2019-01-23", "authors": ["Edwin AHoman", "Michael VReyes", "Kathleen THickey", "John PMorrow"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2018.01847\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.08.043\n10.1001/jama.2013.280521\n10.1136/heartjnl-2014-306238\n10.1172/JCI25371\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.10.025\n10.1161/JAHA.112.000102\n10.3109/07853890.2016.1144930\n10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2018.02.004\n10.1002/clc.23020\n10.1093/ehjqcco/qcw031\n10.1016/S0300-8932(99)74938-9\n10.1172/JCI60329\n10.1001/jama.1994.03510350050036\n10.1161/CIR.0000000000000558\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.10.946\n10.1186/s12933-014-0123-x\n10.1111/j.1540-8167.2009.01653.x\n10.3945/ajcn.112.040287\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.04.031\n10.1161/hc4901.101760\n10.1097/HJH.0b013e328364fb58\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.5.467\n10.1001/archinte.166.21.2322\n10.1007/s11606-010-1340-y\n10.1002/clc.22967\n10.1053/euhj.1998.1094\n10.1111/j.1542-474X.2007.00150.x\n10.1186/s12872-016-0231-5\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.07.045\n10.1016/j.hlc.2017.05.132\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.08.008\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.01.031\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.08.060\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000136587.68725.8E\n10.1056/NEJMoa0802743\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.10.018\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.04.056\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2010.01.005\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2013.03.007\n10.1161/01.CIR.67.5.968\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2017.09.021\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.009035\n10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.12.032\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.09.940\n10.1161/01.CIR.97.21.2154\n10.1111/jgs.12085\n10.1371/journal.pone.0145750\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2016.05.002\n10.1161/hc3201.094151\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16451-9\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000068337.25994.21\n10.1161/01.CIR.51.4.606\n10.1007/s12170-011-0162-8\n10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303329\n10.1007/s00592-009-0157-9\n10.4022/jafib.502\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.11.034\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023163\n10.1001/jama.1991.03470020057032\n10.1152/physrev.00015.2009\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.11.021\n10.1007/s00228-008-0464-z\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.958306\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.006921\n10.1001/archinte.1987.00370100039008\n10.1097/00019501-199606000-00011\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.056309\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.02.050\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000138154.00779.A5\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.03.045\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002525\n10.1136/bmj.316.7133.745\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2012.11.015\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.12.003\n10.1371/journal.pone.0151932\n10.2337/diabetes.53.2.434\n10.1016/S0140-6736(68)92163-6\n10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005598\n10.1111/j.1462-8902.2004.00358.x\n10.1177/2047487315599892\n10.1161/CIRCEP.110.960658\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.008201\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.06.488\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.09.028\n10.1016/j.jacc.2015.03.002\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31277-6\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.015984\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.7.2455\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003313\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.10.034\n10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.11.024\n10.1016/j.ahj.2016.03.004\n10.1007/s11695-007-9160-9\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.07.028\n10.1001/archinternmed.2010.434\n10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60443-8\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61774-8\n10.1016/j.jacc.2012.06.030\n10.1038/sj.ijo.0803233\n10.1096/fj.04-2263com\n10.1164/ajrccm.160.4.9903020\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.309732\n10.1016/S0140-6736(88)90433-3\n10.1016/j.jacc.2017.10.014\n10.1007/s11606-012-2220-4\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehn324\n10.1093/ije/dyv337\n10.1253/circj.71.252\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31258-2\n10.1172/JCI84669\n10.1001/jama.292.20.2471\n10.1016/j.hrthm.2007.04.019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.744466\n10.1016/0735-1097(95)00279-8\n10.1016/j.bbalip.2009.09.023\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.031431\n10.1046/j.1365-2796.2001.00902.x\n10.1016/j.jacc.2010.11.045\n10.1161/CIRCEP.116.004378\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.062653\n10.1161/JAHA.117.007805\n10.1177/000331970005100202\n10.1007/s00125-015-3666-9"}
{"title": "Laminar shear stress alters endothelial KCa2.3 expression in H9c2 cells partially via regulating the PI3K/Akt/p300 axis.", "abstract": "In cardiac tissues, myoblast atrial myocytes continue to be exposed to mechanical forces including shear stress. However, little is known about the effects of shear stress on atrial myocytes, particularly on ion channel function, in association with disease. The present study demonstrated that the Ca2+\u2011activated K+ channel (KCa)2.3 serves a vital role in regulating arterial tone. As increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and activation of histone acetyltransferase p300 (p300) are early responses to laminar shear stress (LSS) that result in the transcriptional activation of genes, the role of p300 and the phosphoinositide3\u2011kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, an intracellular pathway that promotes the growth and proliferation rather than the differentiation of adult cells, in the LSS\u2011dependent regulation of KCa2.3 in cardiac myoblasts was examined. In cultured H9c2 cells, exposure to LSS (15 dyn/cm2) for 12 h markedly increased KCa2.3 mRNA expression. Inhibiting PI3K attenuated the LSS\u2011induced increases in the expression and channel activity of KCa2.3, and decreased the phosphorylation levels of p300. The upregulation of these channels was abolished by the inhibition of Akt through decreasing p300 phosphorylation. ChIP assays indicated that p300 was recruited to the promoter region of the KCa2.3 gene. Therefore, the PI3K/Akt/p300 axis serves a crucial role in the LSS\u2011dependent induction of KCa2.3 expression, by regulating cardiac myoblast function and adaptation to hemodynamic changes. The key novel insights gained from the present study are: i) KCa2.3 was upregulated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and in patients with AF combined with mitral value disease; ii) LSS induced a profound upregulation of KCa2.3 mRNA and protein expression in H9c2 cells; iii) PI3K activation was associated with LSS\u2011induced upregulation of the KCa2.3 channel; iv) PI3K activation was mediated by PI3K/Akt\u2011dependent Akt activation; and v) LSS induction of KCa2.3 involved the binding of p300 to transcription factors in the promoter region of the KCa2.3 gene.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2019-01-22", "authors": ["GuojianLi", "QionghuiYang", "YongYang", "GuokaiYang", "JiaWan", "ZhenhuanMa", "LingjuanDu", "YiSun", "Guimin\u0396hang"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2019.4063\n10.1001/jama.285.18.2370\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.005119\n10.1161/01.CIR.98.10.946\n10.2217/fca.14.13\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.05.063\n10.1161/01.RES.0000054625.24468.08\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00132.x\n10.1152/ajpheart.00642.2012\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.846634\n10.1096/fj.10-158956\n10.1161/01.RES.0000238377.08219.0c\n10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.170613\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.003019\n10.1073/pnas.0606663104\n10.1007/s00395-017-0657-7\n10.1182/blood-2014-10-604272\n10.1136/openhrt-2017-000596\n10.1097/PAI.0000000000000370\n10.1006/meth.2001.1262\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05318.x\n10.1128/MCB.25.15.6592-6602.2005\n10.2147/CLEP.S47385\n10.1016/j.jacc.2014.02.555\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.019893\n10.1161/01.CIR.96.4.1180\n10.3389/fphys.2012.00214\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3182073c78\n10.1371/journal.pone.0097687\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.090126\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.553438\n10.1016/j.jacc.2006.10.047\n10.1016/j.jacc.2007.01.098\n10.1038/ncpcardio1130\n10.1182/blood-2015-01-621466\n10.1007/s13534-016-0210-x\n10.1089/dna.2014.2480\n10.1152/ajpcell.2001.280.4.C962\n10.1007/s12253-012-9600-2\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2003.07.007\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.152942"}

Selenium (Se) can alleviate Pb poisoning. The present study aimed to investigate the alleviative effect of Se on Pb-induced immune toxicity in chicken hearts. One-hundred-and-eighty Hy-line male chickens were randomly divided into four groups at 7 days of age. The control group was offered a standard commercial diet (SD) and drinking water (DW); the Se group was offered SD supplemented with sodium selenite (SeSD) and DW; the Pb\u2009+\u2009Se group was offered SeSD and DW supplemented with lead acetate (PbDW); and the Pb group was offered SD and PbDW. Relative mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12\u03b2, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3), and heat shock proteins (HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) were determined by means of quantitative real-time PCR. Relative protein expression of iNOS, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 was assessed, as well as nitric oxide (NO) content and iNOS activity in heart tissue. The results indicated a down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-\u03b3 and an up-regulation of NO, iNOS, interleukins (IL-4, IL-6, IL-12\u03b2, IL-17), and heat shock proteins (HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) in Pb-damaged hearts.

{"title": "Evaluation of cellular ingrowth within porcine extracellular matrix scaffolding in congenital heart disease surgery.", "abstract": "The search for an ideal material for cardiac tissue repair has led to utilization of porcine small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix (CorMatrix). Here, we examine the histologic features of CorMatrix and the associated cellular growth at a variety of time intervals. Tissues with CorMatrix from ten patients (4 male, 6 female) with ages ranging from 2 weeks to 2 years, and implant duration ranging from 1 week to 2 years were included in this study. Samples for analysis were collected at autopsy. Surgical repair sites included great vessel repair (n=9), atrial septum defect (n=1), coronary vessels (n=1), as well as aortic (n=1) and mitral valve (n=2) leaflets. In all specimens, CorMatrix was composed of dense laminated regions of collagen, without appreciable elastin staining. In most grafts, especially those implanted for extended periods of time, tissue with luminal CD31 positivity covered the intimal surface of the CorMatrix graft. This tissue (neo-intima) consisted of spindled myofibroblasts (SMA) and small CD31 positive vessels with occasional mononuclear cells in a matrix composed of collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and rarely elastin, after extended periods of implantation. These features were readily identified in patients as early as 1 month after CorMatrix implantation. The matrix comprising the CorMatrix itself remained largely acellular, despite implantation times up to 2 years, with degradation of the graft material. We provide a framework for histologic expectations when evaluating explanted CorMatrix grafts. In this regard, the CorMatrix matrix is likely to remain acellular without significant elastin deposition, whereas the intimal and adventitial surfaces become coated by proliferating cells in a novel matrix of collagen and glycosaminoglycans.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2019-01-21", "authors": ["Jesse LCox", "James MHammel", "Stanley JRadio"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2018.12.003"}

Besides, the implementation of analytical tools that allow the depiction and comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the crosstalk between the different cell types is also relevant. In this work, we implemented a human cardiac tissue-like in vitro model, derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC), and evaluated the relevance of the cell-cell communication between the two of the most representative cell populations of the human heart: cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and endothelial cells (hiPSC-EC). We observed that heterotypic cell communication promotes: (a) structural maturation of hiPSC-CM and (b) deposition of several extracellular matrix components (such as collagens and fibronectin). Overall, the toolbox of analytical techniques used in our study not only enabled us to validate previous reports from the literature on the importance of the presence of hiPSC-EC on hiPSC-CM maturation, but also bring new insights on the molecular mechanisms involved in the communication between these two cell types when cocultured in vitro.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2019-01-20", "authors": ["BernardoAbecasis", "Patr\u00edciaGomes-Alves", "SusanaRosa", "Pedro JGouveia", "LinoFerreira", "MargaridaSerra", "Paula MAlves"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.26929"}

Patients with IHD or HF might benefit from novel therapeutic strategies, such as cell-based therapies. We recently discussed the therapeutic potential of cell-based therapies and provided recommendations on how to improve the therapeutic translation of these novel strategies for effective cardiac regeneration and repair. Despite major advances in optimizing these strategies with respect to cell source and delivery method, the clinical outcome of cell-based therapy remains unsatisfactory. Major obstacles are the low engraftment and survival rate of transplanted cells in the harmful microenvironment of the host tissue, and the paucity or even lack of endogenous cells with repair capacity. Therefore, new ways of delivering cells and their derivatives are required in order to empower cell-based cardiac repair and regeneration in patients with IHD or HF. Strategies using tissue engineering (TE) combine cells with matrix materials to enhance cell retention or cell delivery in the transplanted area, and have recently received much attention for this purpose. Here, we summarize knowledge on novel approaches emerging from the TE scenario. In particular, we will discuss how combinations of cell/bio-materials (e.g. hydrogels, cell sheets, prefabricated matrices, microspheres, and injectable matrices) combinations might enhance cell retention or cell delivery in the transplantation areas, thereby increase the success rate of cell therapies for IHD and HF. We will not focus on the use of classical engineering approaches, employing fully synthetic materials, because of their unsatisfactory material properties which render them not clinically applicable.

{"title": "Central and Peripheral Secondary Cell Death Processes after Transient Global Ischemia in Nonhuman Primate Cerebellum and Heart.", "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia and its pathological sequelae are responsible for severe neurological deficits generally attributed to the neural death within the infarcted tissue and adjacent regions. Distal brain regions, and even peripheral organs, may be subject to more subtle consequences of the primary ischemic event which can initiate parallel disease processes and promote comorbid symptomology. In order to characterize the susceptibility of cerebellar brain regions and the heart to transient global ischemia (TGI) in nonhuman primates (NHP), brain and heart tissues were harvested 6\u00a0months post-TGI injury. Immunostaining analysis with unbiased stereology revealed significant cell death in lobule III and IX of the TGI cerebellum when compared to sham cerebellum, coinciding with an increase in inflammatory and apoptotic markers. Cardiac tissue analysis showed similar increases in inflammatory and apoptotic cells within TGI hearts. A progressive inflammatory response and cell death within the cerebellum and heart of chronic TGI NHPs indicate secondary injury processes manifesting both centrally and peripherally. This understanding of distal disease processes of cerebral ischemia underscores the importance of the chronic aberrant inflammatory response and emphasizes the needs for therapeutic options tailored to target these pathways.

In this study, we took opportunity of the Tianzhou-1 (TZ-1) mission to investigate how spaceflight may affect cardiac differentiation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). A bioreactor was engineered to perform cell culturing and the time-lapse imaging experiments on-orbit. Transgenic iPSC lines with either Oct4 or \u03b1-myosin heavy chain (\u03b1MHC) promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression were used to study cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation in real microgravity. The differentiation status was monitored by GFP fluorescence intensity. Interestingly, compared with cells cultured in identical environment at ground gravity, embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from Oct4 reporter iPSC downregulated GFP significantly quicker in space. Meanwhile, EBs derived from \u03b1MHC reporter iPSC activated GFP strongly 4 days after launch (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and lasted for 10 days afterward, indicating robust CM formation. This is the first real-time imaging study of iPSC myocardial differentiation in space. Under our experimental condition, real microgravity enhanced the CM differentiation process of iPSCs. Our study provided rare information about iPSC cardiac differentiation in space.

Since its early advancements, there has been a relentless development in enthusiasm for this innovation in biomedical research. It allows for the fabrication of structures with both complex geometries and heterogeneous material properties. Tissue engineering using 3D bio-printers can overcome the limitations of traditional tissue engineering methods. It can match the complexity and cellular microenvironment of human organs and tissues, which drives much of the interest in this technique. However, most of the preliminary evaluations of 3Dprinted tissues and organ engineering, including cardiac tissue, relies extensively on the lessons learned from traditional tissue engineering. In many early examples, the final printed structures were found to be no better than tissues developed using traditional tissue engineering methods. This highlights the fact that 3D bio-printing of human tissue is still very much in its infancy and more work needs to be done to realise its full potential. This can be achieved through interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers, biomaterial scientists and molecular cell biologists. This review highlights current advancements and future prospects for 3D bio-printing in engineering ex vivo cardiac tissue and associated vasculature, such as coronary arteries. In this context, the role of biomaterials for hydrogel matrices and choice of cells are discussed. 3D bio-printing has the potential to advance current research significantly and support the development of novel therapeutics which can improve the therapeutic outcomes of patients suffering fatal cardiovascular pathologies.", "journal": "Current cardiology reviews", "date": "2019-01-17", "authors": ["Nitin BCharbe", "Flavia CZacconi", "NikhilAmnerkar", "DineshPardhi", "PriyankShukla", "Tareq LMukattash", "Paul AMcCarron", "Murtaza MTambuwala"], "doi": "10.2174/1573403X15666190112154710"}
{"title": "Midkine drives cardiac inflammation by promoting neutrophil trafficking and NETosis in myocarditis.", "abstract": "Heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy is frequently caused by myocarditis. However, the pathogenesis of myocarditis remains incompletely understood. Here, we report the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in cardiac tissue of patients and mice with myocarditis. Inhibition of NET formation in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) of mice substantially reduces inflammation in the acute phase of the disease. Targeting the cytokine midkine (MK), which mediates NET formation in vitro, not only attenuates NET formation in vivo and the infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) but also reduces fibrosis and preserves systolic function during EAM. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) acts as the functionally relevant receptor for MK-induced PMN recruitment as well as NET formation.

{"title": "Region-resolved proteomics profiling of monkey heart.", "abstract": "Nonhuman primates (NHPs) play an indispensable role in biomedical research because of their similarities in genetics, physiological, and neurological function to humans. Proteomics profiling of monkey heart could reveal significant cardiac biomarkers and help us to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of heart disease. However, the proteomic study of monkey heart is relatively lacking. Here, we performed the proteomics profiling of the normal monkey heart by measuring three major anatomical regions (vessels, valves, and chambers) based on iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS analysis. Over 3,200 proteins were identified and quantified from three heart tissue samples. Furthermore, multiple bioinformatics analyses such as gene ontology analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and gene-diseases association were used to investigate biological network of those proteins from each area. More than 60 genes in three heart regions are implicated with heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. These genes associated with heart disease are mainly enriched in citrate cycle, amino acid degradation, and glycolysis pathway. At the anatomical level, the revelation of molecular characteristics of the healthy monkey heart would be an important starting point to investigate heart disease.

Adult male Wister albino rats were assigned to one of the four treatment groups: Rats in group 1 received no treatment but free access to tap water for 28 days. Rats in group 2 received L-carnitine (200\u00a0mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 28 days. Rats in group 3 received SUN (25\u00a0mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 28 days. Rats in group 4 received the same doses of L-carnitine and SUN in drinking water for 28 days. Treatment with SUN significantly increased heart weight, cardiac index, and cardiotoxicity enzymatic indices, as well as severe histopathological changes. Moreover, SUN significantly decreased level of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK\u03b12), total carnitine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) expression and significantly increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 (ACC2) expression and malonyl-CoA level in cardiac tissues. Interestingly, carnitine supplementation resulted in a complete reversal of all the biochemical, gene expression and histopathological changes-induced by SUN to the control values. In conclusion, data from this study suggest that SUN inhibits AMPK downstream signaling with the consequent inhibition of mitochondrial transport of LCFA and energy production in cardiac tissues.

Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize AGE formation and RAGE expression in plasma and cardiac tissue during cardiac remodeling after MI in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized to receive sham surgery (n = 15) or MI induction (n = 14) by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. The MI group was stratified into two subgroups based on postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction: low (MIlowEF) and intermediate (MIintermEF). Echocardiography findings and plasma levels of AGEs, protein carbonyl, and free amines were assessed at baseline and 2, 30, and 120 days postoperatively. At the end of follow-up, the heart was harvested for AGE and RAGE evaluation. No differences were observed in AGE formation in plasma, except for a decrease in absorbance in MIlowEF at the end of follow-up. A decrease in yellowish-brown AGEs in heart homogenate was found, which was confirmed by immunodetection of N-\u03b5-carboxymethyl-lysine. No differences could be seen in plasma RAGE levels among the groups, despite an increase in MI groups over the time.

In particular, these cells hold the potential to unmask the effects of mutations on contractile behaviour in vitro, providing new insights into genotype-phenotype relationships. With this goal in mind, several groups have established iPSC lines that contain sarcomeric gene mutations linked to cardiomyopathy in patient populations. Their studies have employed diverse systems and methods for performing mechanical measurements of contractility, ranging from single cell techniques to multicellular tissue-like constructs. Here, we review published results to date within the growing field of iPSC-based sarcomeric cardiomyopathy disease models. We devote special attention to the methods of mechanical characterization selected in each case, and how these relate to the paradigms of classical muscle mechanics. An appreciation of these somewhat subtle paradigms can inform efforts to compare the results of different studies and possibly reconcile discrepancies. Although more work remains to be done to improve and possibly standardize methods for producing, maturing, and mechanically interrogating iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, the initial results indicate that this approach to modelling cardiomyopathies will continue to provide critical insights into these devastating diseases.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2019-01-10", "authors": ["Lorenzo RSewanan", "Stuart GCampbell"], "doi": "10.1113/JP276753"}
{"title": "Morroniside alleviates coxsackievirus B3-induced myocardial damage apoptosis ", "abstract": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocardial damage always leads to serious heart failure by inducing cardiac injury. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been identified as a central player in the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced viral myocarditis. Therefore, restraining NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been supposed to significantly alleviate the severity of myocardial damage and improve cardiac function. Morroniside (MR), one of the main iridoid glycosides, has the ability to depress the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restrain the expression of caspase-3 and -9. Of importance, ROS and caspase are essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to CVB3 infection. Therefore, in the present study, MR was selected as a model drug to alleviate CVB3-induced myocardial damage. The results of cardiac function index determination showed that abnormal indexes including mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular systolic pressure of myocardial damage rats could be recovered by treating with MR. Such results can be further verified by histopathological evaluation, with the heart tissues of CVB3-infected rats displaying the most amount of H&E and TUNEL positive cells. The underlying mechanism by which MR improves the cardiac function was subsequently investigated. The detection of various gene levels indicated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by MR through down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: interleukin (IL)-\u03b2 and IL-18, the pivotal factors that lead to inflammatory responses. More importantly, the related genes, cardiac function indexes, and various myocardial damage markers of normal rats treated with MR did not exhibit any obvious changes compared with the control group, indicating a satisfactory biocompatibility of MR.

However, amiodarone can have considerable side effects resulting from accumulation in off-target tissues. Cardiac macrophages are highly prevalent tissue-resident immune cells with importance in homeostatic functions, including immune response and modulation of cardiac conduction. We hypothesized that amiodarone could be more efficiently delivered to the heart via cardiac macrophages, an important step toward reducing overall dose and off-target tissue accumulation. Toward this goal, we synthesized a nanoparticle drug carrier composed of l-lysine cross-linked succinyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin that demonstrates amiodarone binding through supramolecular host-guest interaction as well as a high macrophage affinity. Biodistribution analyses at the organ and single-cell level demonstrate accumulation of nanoparticles in the heart resulting from rapid uptake by cardiac macrophages.

However, the dynamic mechanical tension ability also varies due to extracellular matrix remodeling in fibrosis, accompanied with the phenotypic transition from cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to myofibroblasts. It is hypothesized that the dynamic mechanical tension ability regulates cardiac phenotypic transition within fibrosis in a strain-mediated manner. In this study, a microdevice that is able to simultaneously and accurately mimic the biomechanical properties of the cardiac physiological and pathological microenvironment is developed. The microdevice can apply cyclic compressions with gradient magnitudes (5-20%) and tunable frequency onto gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels laden with CFs, and also enables the integration of cytokines. The strain-response correlations between mechanical compression and CFs spreading, and proliferation and fibrotic phenotype remolding, are investigated. Results reveal that mechanical compression plays a crucial role in the CFs phenotypic transition, depending on the strain of mechanical load and myofibroblast maturity of CFs encapsulated in GelMA hydrogels.

Therefore, thorough removal of potentially toxic cryoprotective agents (CPAs) is required before transplantation. CPAs such as dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol (PG), and formamide (FMD), routinely employed in ice-free cryopreservation (IFC), have advantages in long-term preservation of tissue structures compared with conventional cryopreservation employing lower CPA concentrations. This study evaluated the impact of potential residual CPAs on human cardiac valves. Raman microspectroscopy and Raman imaging were established as nondestructive marker-independent techniques for in situ quantitative assessment of CPA residues in IFC valve tissues. In detail, IFC valve leaflets and supernatants of the washing solutions were analyzed to determine the washing efficiency. A calibration model was developed according to the CPA's characteristic Raman signals to quantify DMSO, PG and FMD concentrations in the supernatants. Single point Raman measurements were performed on the intact tissues to analyze penetration properties. In addition, Raman imaging was utilized to visualize potential CPA residues. Our data showed that washing decreased the CPA concentration in the final washing solution by 99%, and no residues could be detected in the washed tissues, validating the multistep CPA removal protocol routinely used for IFC valves. Raman analysis of unwashed tissues showed different permeation characteristics depending on each CPA and their concentration.

Proteins associated with Ca2+ homeostasis regulation in the heart may be involved in these effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms associated with ONOO--induced effects. We evaluated [Ca2+]i regulation, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+- binding proteins, and phosphorylation levels of the ryanodine receptor in isolated rat myocytes. Electrical field-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients and contractions were recorded simultaneously. Myocytes superfused with 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1), an ONOO- donor, decreased the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and contraction in a dose-response (1-200 \u03bcM) manner. Similarly, SIN-1 increased half-time decay in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-infusion of the ONOO- donor with FeTMPyP (1 \u03bcM), an ONOO- decomposition catalyst, inhibited the effects induced by ONOO-. Impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake caused by ONOO- (SIN-1 200 \u03bcM) was confirmed by a reduction of caffeine-evoked Ca2+ release along with prolongation of the half-time decay. Surprisingly, ONOO- induced a spontaneous Ca2+ transient that started at the beginning of the relaxation phase and was inhibited by tetracaine. Also, reduced phosphorylation at the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)-Ser-2814 site was observed. In conclusion, deficient sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-mediated Ca2+ uptake concomitant with augmented Ca2+ release by RyR2 in myocytes may be associated with modification of myocyte Ca2+ handling by ONOO-. Thus, development of cardiac failure in diabetes, nephropathy, or hypertension may be related with elevated ONOO- in cardiac tissue.", "journal": "Folia biologica", "date": "2019-01-01", "authors": ["VFlores-Tamez", "BEscalante", "ARios"], "doi": null}

One potential therapeutic strategy is to enhance proliferation of resident cardiomyocytes. However, phenotypic screening for therapeutic agents is challenged by the limited ability of conventional markers to discriminate between cardiomyocyte proliferation and endoreplication (e.g. polyploidy and multinucleation). Here, we developed a novel assay that combines automated live-cell microscopy and image processing algorithms to discriminate between proliferation and endoreplication by quantifying changes in the number of nuclei, changes in the number of cells, binucleation, and nuclear DNA content. We applied this assay to further prioritize hits from a primary screen for DNA synthesis, identifying 30 compounds that enhance proliferation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

The damaged muscular tissues are replaced by scar tissues and burdens the healthy muscles resulting in further attenuated functioning of heart. Since, human heart muscles cannot regenerate naturally or it has been thought so, pharmacological procedures such as using a heart assist device are followed to restore the lost function of heart. Stem cell engineering and cardiac patches offers promising prospects with their cutting edge research reports. Cardiac patches offers a viable solution as they can also function as an implant to assist in offering the mechanical support the damaged muscles were capable of. Designing cardiac patches to suit multiple functions is not only challenging but also perilous due to the target organ with which it will be interfaced. Sensor based, electrically active, miniaturized circuitry etc., poses a huge threat to the individual in whom the device/patch is implanted. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis on choosing \u03b2-PVDF based nanocomposites as the inimitable material for designing implantable cardiac patches. \u03b2-PVDF based nanocomposite materials is expected to exhibit piezoelectric effect and contribute to the adherence, proliferation and maturation of stem cells. Physico-chemical characterizations followed by in vitro cell line studies were performed in ought to confirm the same. The results revealed that the \u03b2-PVDF based nanocomposite material was mechanically stable and supportive in cardiomyocyte adherence and differentiation when compared to standard non piezoelectric scaffolds (control).

In APEC E058 (O2 serogroup), there are two copies of the outer membrane protease (ompT) gene, compT encoding cOmpT that is located on the chromosome and pompT encoding pOmpT that is located on a ColV plasmid. However, the relationship between pathogenesis and pompT expression in APEC E058 has yet to be elucidated. Here, we successfully constructed two pompT gene mutants: E058\u0394pompT containing a chloramphenicol (cat) resistance gene and E058\u0394pompT' without the cat gene. By RT-PCR and sequencing analysis, an unexpected transcriptome pompT' was detected in mutant strain E058\u0394pompT' after deletion of the cat gene induced by the lambda red recombination system. Surprisingly, the pathogenicity of mutant E058\u0394pompT was significantly attenuated compared to its parental strain in the chicken infection model and HD11 cell model then the pompT gene was knocked out, while the pathogenicity of the other mutant strain E058\u0394pompT' had no difference. Furthermore, the presence of unexpected transcriptome pompT' influenced the bactericidal activity of SPF chicken serum and decreased the transcription level of TLR2 in the heart tissue of chickens. Our study identifies the pompT gene plays an important role in the virulence of APEC E058, and the unexpected transcriptome pompT' contributes to the increased pathogenicity of APEC E058 mutants following deletion of the cat gene induced by the lambda red recombination system, which suggests that this system still has some limitations for construction of mutant strains particularly where these are used in development of live vaccine.", "journal": "Veterinary microbiology", "date": "2018-12-30", "authors": ["JuanhuaLiu", "XiaohuiMu", "XiaoboWang", "HaixiaHuan", "QingqingGao", "JuanChen", "PeizhuangQiao", "LuyaoJiang", "SongGao", "XiufanLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.11.011"}

Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), which is an effective treatment modality for osteoarthropathy, has been recently illustrated regulating the overactive inflammatory response in various diseases. Here, we aimed to investigate whether LIPUS could attenuate coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection-induced injury by coordinating the inflammatory response. Male BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with CVB3 to establish the model of acute viral myocarditis. LIPUS treatment was given on Day 1, Day 1, 3 and Day 1, 3, 5 post-inoculation, respectively. All mice were followed up for 14 days. Day 1, 3, 5 LIPUS treatment significantly improved the survival rate, attenuated the ventricular dysfunction and ameliorated the cardiac histopathological injury of CVB3-infected mice.

RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5)-mediating protein (RMP) is a transcriptional mediating protein which co-ordinates cellular processes including gene expression, metabolism, proliferation, and genome stability. However, its role in cardiac disease remains unknown. We aimed to determine the role and regulatory mechanisms of RMP in cardiomyocyte function and the development of HF.\nMyocardial RMP expression was examined in human heart tissues from healthy controls and patients with advanced HF. Compared to normal cardiac tissues, RMP levels were significantly decreased in the myocardium of patients with advanced HF. To investigate the role of RMP in cardiac function, Cre-loxP recombinase technology was used to generate tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific Rmp knockout mice. Unexpectedly, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rmp in mice resulted in contractile dysfunction, cardiac dilatation, and fibrosis. Furthermore, the lifespan of cardiac-specific Rmp-deficient mice was significantly shortened when compared with littermates. Mechanistically, we found that chronic HF in Rmp-deficient mice was associated with impaired mitochondrial structure and function, which may be mediated via a transforming growth factor-\u03b2/Smad3-proliferator-activated receptor coactivator1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1)-dependent mechanism. PGC1\u03b1 overexpression partially rescued chronic HF in cardiomyocyte-specific Rmp-deficient mice, and Smad3 blockade protected against the loss of PGC1\u03b1 and adenosine triphosphate content that was induced by silencing RMP in vitro.\nRMP plays a protective role in chronic HF.

Here, a novel cellular mechanical visualizable biosensor formed by assembling engineered cardiac tissues on the Morpho butterfly wings is presented. The assembled cardiomyocytes benefit from the periodic parallel nanoridges of the wings and can recover their autonomic beating ability with guided cellular orientation and good contraction performance. As the beating processes are accompanied by the cardiomyocytes' elongation and contraction, the elastic butterfly wing substrate undergoes the same cycle of deformations, which causes corresponding synchronous shifts in their structural colors and photonic bandgaps for self-reporting of the cell mechanics. It is demonstrated that this self-reporting performance can be further improved by adding oriented carbon nanotubes in the nanoridges of the wings for the culture. In addition, taking advantage of the similar size of the cardiomyocyte and a single Morpho wing scale, the investigation of single-cell-level mechanics can be realized by detecting the optical performance of a single scale.

In the study, we illustrated that the expression of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4), associated with the pathological development of various inflammatory diseases, was down-regulated in pressure overload-induced hearts of patients and mice. LILRB4-knockout mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure by promoting cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis. Mechanistically, transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) expression was significantly promoted by LILRB4 deficiency in hearts of mice after aortic banding (AB) surgery. AB-induced inflammation in cardiac tissues was accelerated by LILRB4 deletion through elevating nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway.

Here, cardiac hypertrophy was induced by injection of l-thyroxine or ISO in SD rats. In the treatment group, AdipoRon was co-administered. We examined the effects of AdipoRon on cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophy signaling pathway. The weight of SD rats was recorded every day. Rats were killed for collection of blood and heart under anesthesia. The left heart weight and heart weight were weighed. Paraffin-embedded heart tissue regions (4 \u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson to detect left heart hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. The serum BNP levels were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of ANP, BNP, PGC-1\u03b1, and ERR\u03b1 were evaluated by real-time PCR analysis. The protein expression levels of PGC-1\u03b1, ERR\u03b1, and pAMPK/AMPK were determined by western blot analysis. The results showed that AdipoRon significantly reversed heart weight (HW)/body weight (BW) ratio, left ventricular (LV)/BW ratio, serum BNP level and the mRNA level of ANP and BNP induced by ISO or l-thyroxine. ISO or l-thyroxine reduced both the mRNA level and protein level of ERR\u03b1 and PGC-1\u03b1, and also reduced the protein level of pAMPK/AMPK. However, AdipoRon reversed ISO or l-thyroxine-induced changes of pAMPK/AMPK, ERR\u03b1, and PGC-1\u03b1. Our data indicated that the effects of AdipoRon are mediated partly by activating AMPK-related pathway, and AdipoRon plays a potential role in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy.", "journal": "Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica", "date": "2018-12-20", "authors": ["XinleiHu", "QiongOu-Yang", "LanlanWang", "TingtingLi", "XiaoxueXie", "JunLiu"], "doi": "10.1093/abbs/gmy152"}
{"title": "New Molecular Mechanism Underlying Myc-Mediated Cytochrome P450 2E1 Upregulation in Apoptosis and Energy Metabolism in the Myocardium.", "abstract": "Background Canonical studies indicate that cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP 2E1) plays a critical role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and ultimately participates in tissue damage. CYP 2E1 upregulates in the pathophysiological development of multiple diseases; however, the mechanism of CYP 2E1 upregulation, particularly in heart disease, remains elusive. Methods and Results We found that the level of CYP 2E1 increased in heart tissues from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; multiple mouse models of heart diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and myocardial ischemia; and HL -1 myocytes under stress. We determined that Myc bound to the CYP 2E1 promoter and activated its transcription by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, and Myc expression was modulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B pathways under stress or injury in myocardium by signal transduction analysis. In addition, the level of oxidative stress and apoptosis gradually worsened with age in transgenic mice overexpressing CYP 2E1, which was significantly inhibited with CYP 2E1 knockdown. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that CYP 2E1 is likely a sensor of diverse pathophysiological factors and states in the myocardium. Upregulated CYP 2E1 has multiple pathophysiological roles in the heart, including increased oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as energy supply to meet the energy demand of the heart in certain disease states. Our discovery thus provides a basis for a therapeutic strategy for heart diseases targeting Myc and CYP 2E1.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2018-12-20", "authors": ["FeifeiGuan", "XinlanYang", "JingLi", "WeiDong", "XuZhang", "NingLiu", "ShanGao", "JizhengWang", "LianfengZhang", "DanLu"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.118.009871"}

Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is common in clinical practice, while its mechanism is unknown. It has been proved that lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 may promote doxorubicin resistance and WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1 (WISP1) blocks doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte death. Our study aimed to investigate the involvement of lncRNA FOXC2-AS1 and WISP1 in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and to explore their interactions. In our study we observed that FOXC2-AS1 and WISP1 mRNA were downregulated in heart tissues of mice with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. FOXC2-AS1 and WISP1 mRNA expression were positively correlated in mice with Dox-induced cardiotoxicity but not in healthy mice. Overexpression of FOXC2-AS1 promoted to viability of mice cardiomyocytes under Dox treatment and also increased the expression level of WISP1. In contrast, WISP1 overexpression showed no significant effect on FOXC2-AS1.

{"title": "Approaches to therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic heart disease.", "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is caused by the narrowing of arteries that work to provide blood, nutrients, and oxygen to the myocardial tissue. The worldwide epidemic of IHD urgently requires innovative treatments despite the significant advances in medical, interventional, and surgical therapies for this disease. Angiogenesis is a physiological and pathophysiological process that initiates vascular growth from pre-existing blood vessels in response to a lack of oxygen. This process occurs naturally over time and has encouraged researchers and clinicians to investigate the outcomes of accelerating or enhancing this angiogenic response as an alternative IHD therapy. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been shown to revascularize ischemic heart tissue, reduce the progression of tissue infarction, and evade the need for invasive surgical procedures or tissue/organ transplants. Several approaches, including the use of proteins, genes, stem/progenitor cells, and various combinations, have been employed to promote angiogenesis. While clinical trials for these approaches are ongoing, microvesicles and exosomes have recently been investigated as a cell-free approach to stimulate angiogenesis and may circumvent limitations of using viable cells.

This investigation showed G. acuta treatment ameliorated cardiac structural disorder, excessive collagenous fiber accumulation and cardiac malfunction. Compared with the ISO induced model group, G. acuta treatment increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and glutathione (GSH) level, prevented the rise of malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreased hydroxyproline contents in the heart tissues. Moreover, G. acuta reduced the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and inhibited the expression and activation of NF-\u03baB-P65 in myocardial tissues.

Twenty-eight adult male Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups as follows: Group I received normal saline (2\u2009ml/kg) orally for 14 days, group II received DOX (2.5\u2009mg/kg; in six injections; accumulative dose: 15\u2009mg/kg) intraperitonially for 14 days, group III received DOX\u2009+\u2009GEM (100\u2009mg/kg) orally for 14 days concomitantly with DOX administration, and group IV received GEM orally for 14 days. Lipid panel, various biochemical biomarkers, and histological observations were evaluated in serum and heart samples. According to our results, DOX significantly increased the levels of lipid panel (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoproteins cholesterol) as well as markers of cardiac dysfunction (Aspartate aminotransferase, Creatine kinase-muscle/brain, Lactate dehydrogenase and Cardiac Troponin I). Moreover, DOX significantly increased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, administration of DOX reduced the level of glutathione as well as the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and Glutathione peroxidase activities. DOX-treated rats showed significantly higher tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2.

However, in addition to the neurological disease, mutant HTT (mHTT), which is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, impairs other organ systems. Not surprisingly, cardiovascular dysautonomia as well as the deterioration of circadian rhythms are among the earliest detectable pathophysiological changes in individuals with HD. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain and skeletal muscle in HD has been well documented, as the disease progresses. However, not much is known about mitochondrial abnormalities in the heart. In this study, we describe a role for Drp1/Fis1-mediated excessive mitochondrial fission and dysfunction, associated with lysosomal dysfunction in H9C2 expressing long polyglutamine repeat (Q73) and in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes transfected with Q77. Expression of long polyglutamine repeat led to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial fragmentation. We observed an increased accumulation of damaged mitochondria in the lysosome that was coupled with lysosomal dysfunction. Importantly, reducing Drp1/Fis1-mediated mitochondrial damage significantly improved mitochondrial function and cell survival. Finally, reducing Fis1-mediated Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria, using the selective inhibitor of this interaction, P110, improved mitochondrial structure in the cardiac tissue of R6/2 mice.

Myocardial tissue engineering aims to create transplantable units of myocardium for the treatment of myocardial necrosis caused by ischemic heart disease - bioreactors are used to condition these bioartificial tissues before application.\nOur group developed a multimodal bioreactor consisting of a linear drive motor for pulsatile flow generation (500\u00a0ml/min) and an external pacemaker for electrical stimulation (10\u00a0mA, 3\u00a0V at 60\u00a0Hz) using LinMot-Talk Software to synchronize these modes of stimulation. Polyurethane scaffolds were seeded with 0.750 \u00d7 106 mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord tissue per cm2 and stimulated in our system for 72\u00a0h, then evaluated.\nAfter conditioning histology showed that the patches consisted of a cell multilayer surviving stimulation without major damage by the multimodal stimulation, scanning electron microscopy showed a confluent cell layer with no cell-cell interspaces visible. No cell viability issues could be identified via Syto9-Propidium Iodide staining.\nThis bioreactor allows mechanical stimulation via pulsatile flow and electrical stimulation through a pacemaker.

{"title": "Fundamental Characterization of Conductive Intracardiac Communication for Leadless Multisite Pacemaker Systems.", "abstract": "A new generation of leadless cardiac pacemakers effectively overcomes the main limitations of conventional devices, but only offer single-chamber pacing, although dual-chamber or multisite pacing is highly desirable for most patients. The combination of several leadless pacemakers could facilitate a leadless multisite pacemaker but requires an energy-efficient wireless communication for device synchronization. This study investigates the characteristics of conductive intracardiac communication between leadless pacemakers to provide a basis for future designs of leadless multisite pacemaker systems.\nSignal propagation and impedance behavior of blood and heart tissue were examined by in vitro and in vivo measurements on domestic pig hearts and by finite-element simulations in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz.\nA better signal transmission was obtained for frequencies higher than 10 kHz. The influence of a variety of practical parameters on signal transmission could be identified. A larger distance between pacemakers increases signal attenuation. A better signal transmission is obtained through larger inter-electrode distances and a larger electrode surface area. Furthermore, the influence of pacemaker encapsulation and relative device orientation was assessed.\nThis study suggests that conductive intracardiac communication is well suited to be incorporated in leadless pacemakers. It potentially offers very low power consumption using low communication frequencies.\nThe presented technique enables highly desired leadless multisite pacing in near future.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems", "date": "2018-12-12", "authors": ["LukasBereuter", "TimonKuenzle", "ThomasNiederhauser", "MartinKucera", "DominikObrist", "TobiasReichlin", "HildegardTanner", "AndreasHaeberlin"], "doi": "10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2886042"}
{"title": "A review of cardiac glycosides: Structure, toxicokinetics, clinical signs, diagnosis and antineoplastic potential.", "abstract": "Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are secondary compounds found in plants and amphibians and are widely distributed in nature with potential cardiovascular action. Their mechanism is based on the blockage of the heart's sodium potassium ATPase, with a positive inotropic effect. Some of the most well-known CGs are digoxin, ouabain, oleandrin, and bufalin. They have similar chemical structures: a lactone ring, steroid ring, and sugar moiety. Digoxin, ouabain, and oleandrin are classified as cardenolides, consisting of a lactone ring with five carbons, while bufalin is classified as bufodienolides, with a six-carbon ring. Small structural differences determine variations in the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of such substances. Most case reports of poisoning caused by CGs are associated with cardiovascular toxicity, causing a variety of arrhythmias and lesions in the heart tissue. Experimental studies also describe important similarities among different CGs, especially regarding species sensitivity. Recent studies furthermore focus on their antineoplastic potential, with controversial results.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the protective role of aqueous bark extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against Cd induced oxidative damage in hepatic and cardiac tissues as the TA bark extract has folkloric medicinal use in the treatment of various hepatic and cardiac disorders. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. The control group was treated with normal saline as the vehicle; the second group orally administered with TA (20\u202fmg/kg bw) daily for 15 days; the third group injected with Cd-acetate (0.44\u202fmg/kg bw, s.c.) every alternate day for a period of 15 days; and the fourth group was administered with TA, 60\u202fmin prior to Cd treatment. The biomarkers of organ damage were significantly increased in the Cd treated groups. Besides, a significant alteration in the tissue levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress, the activities and the levels of antioxidant enzymes was observed following treatment with Cd. Additionally, some of the enzymes were found to be inhibited uncompetitively by Cd when tested in an in vitro system. Furthermore, evidence gathered from studies on the histological parameters and mitochondrial membrane potential in both the tissues argue in favour of the possible protective role of TA against Cd induced damage. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of eight major bioactive phytochemicals in aqueous bark extract of TA having potent free radical scavenging property.

It exhibits anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. Recent studies have revealed that GA has beneficial effects against several cardiovascular diseases; however, whether GA attenuates pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and the underlying mechanism remains unclear.\nPrimary cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II). Cardiac hypertrophic remodeling is induced in mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Myocardial function is evaluated by echocardiographic and hemodynamic analyses, while cardiac tissues are analyzed by histological staining. It is observed that GA significantly decreases Ang II-induced increases in cardiomyocyte size in vitro. Administration of GA in mice markedly improves TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction and attenuates pathological changes, including cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, GA inhibits ULK1 and activates autophagy, which induces the degradation of EGFR, gp130, and calcineurin A, thereby inhibiting the downstream signaling cascades (AKT, ERK1/2, JAK2/STAT3, and NFATc1).\nThe results demonstrate for the first time that GA prevents myocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction via an autophagy-dependent mechanism.

We examined the lipolytic effect of natriuretic peptide infusion in healthy young men and evaluated the effect in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Six young healthy normotensive men underwent infusion with ANP, BNP, or CNP for 20\u2009min. Blood samples were collected before, during, and after infusion for measurement of FFAs. In a porcine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, animals were infused for 3\u2009h with either BNP (n\u2009=\u20097) or saline (n\u2009=\u20095). Blood samples were collected throughout the infusion period, and cardiac tissue was obtained after infusion for lipid analysis. In humans, ANP infusion dose-dependently increased the FFA concentration in plasma 2.5-10-fold (baseline vs. 0.05\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min P\u2009<\u20090.002) and with BNP 1.6-3.5-fold (P\u2009=\u20090.001, baseline vs. 0.02\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min) 30\u2009min after initiation of infusion. Infusion of CNP did not affect plasma FFA. In pigs, BNP infusion induced a 3.5-fold increase in plasma FFA (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), which remained elevated throughout the infusion period. Triglyceride content in porcine right cardiac ventricle tissue increased \u223c5.5 fold in animals infused with BNP (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Natriuretic peptide infusion has similar lipolytic activity in human and pig.

Approximately 30% of the cases evolve to the chronic symptomatic stage due to cardiac and/or digestive damage, generally accompanied by nervous system impairment. Given the higher frequency and severity of clinical manifestations related to cardiac tissue lesion, the goal of this study was the identification of proteins associated with the disease progression towards its cardiac form. Thus, T. cruzi bloodstream trypomastigotes proteins were submitted to immunoprecipitation using antibodies from patients with the asymptomatic or cardiac (stages B1 and C) forms of the disease and from healthy donors as control. Immunoreactive proteins were identified and quantified based on mass spectrometry analysis and shifts in the recognition profile were further evaluated. Compared to asymptomatic samples, IgG from stage C patients predominantly detected the I/6 autoantigen, whereas IgG from B1 patients resulted in higher yield of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase precursor, calpain cysteine peptidase, and two variants of CAP5.5. In this work, CAP5.5 recognition by serum immunoglobulin from patients with early cardiomyopathy generated a 23-fold abundance variation when compared to samples from asymptomatic patients, highlighting the participation of this protein in cardiac form progression of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE: While T. cruzi has become the major cause of infectious cardiomyopathy in Latin America, research groups have been struggling to find alternative treatment, vaccine candidates, and improved diagnostic tests. In addition, the absence of adequate biomarkers to assess cure and progression of disease is a major setback for clinical trials and patients monitoring. Therefore, our findings may contribute to a better understanding of T. cruzi pathogenesis and evaluation of suitable candidates for vaccine and diagnostic tests, besides the clinical applicability of the potential biomarkers for patient follow-up and prognosis. Finally, the identification of T. cruzi proteins recognized by IgG from healthy donors may contribute for the understanding and discovery of epitope conservation among a broad range of pathogens.", "journal": "Journal of proteomics", "date": "2018-12-07", "authors": ["Marcelle ACaminha", "Virginia Maria Bde Lorena", "Wilsonde Oliveira J\u00fanior", "JonasPerales", "Paulo CCarvalho", "Diogo BLima", "Maria da Gl\u00f3ria A MCavalcanti", "S\u00edlvia MMartins", "Richard HValente", "Rubem F SMenna-Barreto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jprot.2018.11.019"}

Notably, these molecules recently emerged also as potential circulating biomarkers of several cardiac diseases. Thus, the aim of this study was the simultaneous investigation of circulating and cardiac tissue miRNAs expression upon DOX treatment in vivo.\nTwenty C57BL/6 female mice were administered with 24\u2009mg/Kg cumulative dose of DOX or saline (CTRL) for 2 weeks. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and at the end of treatment (T1). Plasma and heart samples were collected at T1, separating atria from left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles, and miRNAs expression was tested by RT-qPCR-based arrays. All putatively DOX-regulated candidates were then validated by single assays in vivo and then evaluated also in murine immortalized cardiomyocytes (HL-1) treated with 1 \u03bcM DOX for 24\u2009h. In the end, bioinformatics target prediction was performed for all DOX-miRNAs.\nCardiotoxicity onset was diagnosed upon impairment of six cardiac functional parameters in DOX-treated mice at T1. Samples collection, followed by screening and validation steps, identified eleven miRNAs dysregulated by the drug in plasma, while seven resulted as altered in separate heart chambers. Interestingly, miR-34a-5p and miR-451a showed a dysregulation in both plasma and tissue samples of DOX-administered animals, whereas five additional miRNAs presented chamber specific modulation. Of note, in vitro experiments showed a very modest overlap with in vivo results. Bioinformatics prediction analysis performed on miR-34a-5p and miR-451a identified several putative targets presenting no significant association with cardiotoxicity.

The serum CK activity was higher in infected animals 48 and 72\u202fh post-infection compared to the control group, as well as observed for mitochondrial cardiac CK activity. The serum PK activity was higher in infected animals after 72\u202fh of infection compared to the control group, and lower in the cardiac tissue. The cardiac AK activity was lower in infected animals 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh post-infection compared to the control group, while serum and cardiac LDH activities were higher. Based on these evidences, it is possible to conclude that the stimulation of CK activity exerts a key role as an attempt to maintain the bioenergetic homeostasis by the production of phosphocreatine to avoid a rapid fall on the concentrations of total adenosine triphosphate. In summary, the phosphoryl transfer network can be considered a pathway involved in the improvement on tissue and cellular energy homeostasis of S. aureus-infected mice.", "journal": "Microbial pathogenesis", "date": "2018-11-16", "authors": ["GessicaPerin", "Matheus DBaldissera", "Antonise MJaguezeski", "Regiane BCrecencio", "Lenita MStefani", "AndersonGris", "Ricardo EMendes", "Carine FSouza", "VanessaDalzuk", "Aleksandro Sda Silva"], "doi": "10.1016/j.micpath.2018.11.011"}

And exhibits multiple biological activities, including an antioxidant activity. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of its antioxidant activity remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidant activity of QI and the underlying molecular mechanism in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). An oxidative stress model was established in HUVECs using H2O2, and cells were then treated with different concentrations of QI. The results revealed that the exposure of HUVECs to QI protected these cells from H2O2\u2011induced damage. QI treatment also increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in the cell culture medium. In addition, QI inhibited H2O2\u2011induced apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of cleaved Caspase\u20119 and poly(ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase. QI also inhibited the production of DNA fragments and reactive oxygen species induced by H2O2. Furthermore, QI decreased the oxidative stress by promoting the nuclear transfer of nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2011related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase\u20111 by activating autophagy, and inhibited the competition of Bach1 from Nrf2. Finally, QI significantly improved the activities of T\u2011SOD and GSH, and decreased the content of malondialdehyde in the serum and heart tissue of aging rats.

However, it is still not clear how the key inflammatory mediator interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) plays a role in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy. We report here that DOX-induced heart dysfunction involves IFN\u03b3 signaling in mice. The IFN\u03b3 receptor was found to be highly expressed on cardiomyocytes, and its downstream signaling was activated in heart tissues upon DOX treatment. In vitro, IFN\u03b3 strongly aggravated the injury of cardiomyocytes exposed to DOX. Although not affecting DOX-induced cell death, IFN\u03b3 disrupted mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation in DOX-exposed cardiomyocytes. IFN\u03b3 extended the suppression of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) axis by DOX to a p38-dependent branch. Activation of AMPK or inhibition of p38 inhibited the enhancing effect of IFN\u03b3 on the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and prolonged the survival time in DOX-treated mice. Taken together, our results indicate that reprogramming of cardiac metabolism by IFN\u03b3 represents a previously unidentified key step for DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. This unavoidable impact of IFN\u03b3 on cardiomyocyte metabolism during chemotherapy redirects our attention to the balance between beneficial immunosurveillance of cancer cells and unwanted toxic side-effects.

The present study explored the relationship between enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling and lowered production of miR-199a-5p in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. This study firstly found the correlation between elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-11, as well as subsequent STAT3 signaling activation and the downregulation of miR-199a-5p in hypoxic myocardial samples from children with congenital heart disease. Then, using model of hypoxic mice and the intervention of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), it was observed that pSTAT3 affected the expression of miR-199a-5p and modulated the expression of its target genes, including endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and 78\u00a0kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). Further observation revealed that the pSTAT3 signal in cardiac tissue could affect the expression of pri-miR-199a-2, a precursor of miR-199a-5p. And the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay also confirmed that pSTAT3 could bind to the promoter region of miR-199a-2 gene, which is more significant under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, the activation of STAT3 signaling in cardiomyocytes during chronic hypoxia leads to downregulation of miR-199a-5p, which promotes the expression of many downstream target genes.

{"title": "The influence of electrically conductive and non-conductive nanocomposite scaffolds on the maturation and excitability of engineered cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Utilization of electrically conductive nanomaterials for developing nanocomposite scaffolds has been at the center of attention for engineering functional cardiac tissues. The primary motive in the use of conductive nanomaterials has been to develop biomimetic scaffolds to recapitulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the native heart and to promote cardiac tissue maturity, excitability and electrical signal propagation. Alternatively, it is well accepted that the inclusion of nanomaterials also alters the stiffness and nano-scale topography of the scaffolds. However, what is missing in the literature is that to what extent the sole presence of nanomaterials within a scaffold, regardless of their conductivity, influences the maturation and excitability of engineered cardiac tissues. To address this knowledge gap, we developed four different classes of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels, with varied concentrations, embedded electrically conductive gold nanorods (GNRs) and non-conductive silica nanomaterials (SNPs), to assess the influence of matrix stiffness and the presence of nanomaterials on cardiac cell adhesion, protein expression (i.e. maturation), and tissue-level excitability. Our results demonstrated that either embedding nanomaterials (i.e. GNRs and SNPs) or increasing the matrix stiffness significantly promoted cellular retention and the expression of cardiac-specific markers, including sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin (SAC), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and connexin43 (Cx43) gap junctions. Notably, excitation voltage thresholds at a high frequency (i.e. 2 Hz and higher), in both coupled and uncoupled gap junctions induced by heptanol, were lower for scaffolds embedded conductive GNRs or non-conductive SNPs, independent of matrix stiffness. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the sole presence of nanomaterials within the scaffolding matrix had a more pronounced influence as compared to the scaffold stiffness on the cell-cell coupling, maturation and excitability of engineered cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Biomaterials science", "date": "2018-11-15", "authors": ["AliNavaei", "KiarashRahmani Eliato", "RobertRos", "Raymond QMigrino", "Brigham CWillis", "MehdiNikkhah"], "doi": "10.1039/c8bm01050a"}

The aim of the present study is to expand our understanding of the complex metabolic alterations in the transition from pathological hypertrophy to heart failure and exploit the results from a translational perspective.\nMice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham surgery and sacrificed 2\u2009weeks, 4\u2009weeks, or 6\u2009weeks after the procedure. Samples from plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, and heart were collected and analysed using metabolomics. Cardiac samples were also analysed by transcriptional profiling. Progressive alterations of key cardiac metabolic pathways and gene expression patterns indicated impaired mitochondrial function and a metabolic switch during transition to heart failure. Similar to the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle revealed significant metabolic alterations such as depletion of essential fatty acids and glycerolipids in late stages of heart failure. Circulating metabolites, particularly fatty acids, reflected cardiac metabolic defects, and deteriorating heart function. For example, inverse correlation was found between plasma and the heart levels of triacylglycerol (C18:1, C18:2, C18:3), and sphingomyelin (d18:1, C23:0) already at an early stage of heart failure. Interestingly, combining metabolic and transcriptional data from cardiac tissue revealed that decreased carnitine shuttling and transportation preceded mitochondrial dysfunction. We, thus, studied the therapeutic potential of OCTN2 (Organic Cation/Carnitine Transporter 2), an important factor for carnitine transportation.

This study was designed to investigate the role of calpain-2 and its downstream signal pathway in heat stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart dysfunction. In cultured primary mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes (MNCs), heat stress (43\u00b0C for 2\u2009hr) induced a heat-shock response, as indicated by upregulated heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) expression and cellular apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and decreased cell viability. Meanwhile, heat stress decreased calpain activity, which was accompanied by downregulated calpain-2 expression and increased phosphorylation of p38, extraceIIuIar signaI-reguIated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminaI kinase (JNK). Calpain-2 overexpression abrogated heat stress-induced apoptosis and phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, but not of ERK1/2. Blocking only p38 prevented heat stress-induced apoptosis in MNCs. In cardiac-specific calpain-2 overexpressing transgenic mice, p38 phosphorylation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were decreased in the heart tissue of heatstroke mice, as revealed by western blot and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u00a0dUTP nick end labelling assays, respectively. M-mode echocardiography also demonstrated that calpain-2 overexpression significantly improved heatstroke-induced decreases in ventricular end-diastolic volume and cardiac output. In conclusion, our study suggests that heat stress reduces calpain-2 expression, which then activates p38, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart dysfunction.", "journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "date": "2018-11-13", "authors": ["Zhi-FengLiu", "Jing-JingJi", "DongZheng", "LeiSu", "TianqingPeng"], "doi": "10.1002/jcp.27750"}

Preeclampsia (PE) reverts these normal changes inducing hypertension. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been related in PE genesis. It has been reported a novel receptor in the system, the Prorenin/Renin receptor (PRR), with several roles in renal and cardiovascular illnesses. It is not known, however, if PRR changes its expression or is activated during normal or PE-complicated pregnancy on tissues intimately related to hypertension. So, the aim of this work was to describe PRR expression during normal and hypertensive pregnancy in rats.\nWe used a subrenal aortic coarctation (SRAC) model in rats. Atria, septum and ventricular heart tissue, aorta and renal tissue samples were homogenized and immunoblotted using anti-PRR and anti-PLZF antibodies. We also measured gene expression by RT-PCR.\nHypertension and proteinuria were observed in SRAC-pregnant rats. In pregnant, non-SRAC rats, PRR showed a higher expression of both, gene and protein compared to non-pregnant rats in heart, aorta and kidney tissues. PE induces a very high expression of PRR in cardiac tissues and, on the contrary, decreases PRR expression in both, aorta and kidney. PLZF, a marker of PRR function, was augmented only in aorta and kidney in non-SRAC pregnant rats. In SRAC-pregnant rats, PLZF increment disappeared.\nThese findings indicate that PRR expression changes differently during pregnancy and PE in tissues related to cardiovascular functions and suggest a probable participation of the receptor during normal and preeclamptic pregnancy in the rat.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2018-11-12", "authors": ["M AAvila-Ram\u00edrez", "R LEsteban-Mart\u00ednez", "EL\u00f3pez-Moctezuma", "LAnguiano-Robledo", "M EHern\u00e1ndez-Campos", "PL\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2018.11.017"}

Six hours after the I/R operation, mice were intravenously injected with resistin-treated ADSCs (ADSC-resistin) or vehicle-treated ADSCs (ADSC-vehicle). Cardiac homing by ADSCs and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were investigated 3 days after I/R. Cardiac function, fibrosis, and angiogenesis were evaluated 4 wk after I/R. Cellular and molecular mechanisms were investigated in vitro using cultured ADSCs. Both immunostaining and flow cytometric experiments showed that resistin treatment promoted ADSC myocardial homing 3 days after intravenous injection. Echocardiographic experiments showed that ADSC-resistin, but not ADSC-vehicle, significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction. ADSC-resistin transplantation significantly mitigated I/R-induced fibrosis and reduced atrial natriuretic peptide/brain natriuretic peptide mRNA expression.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether hyperoxia would also mitigate myocardial injury and improve heart function in the absence of chronic cardiovascular comorbidity.After 3\u200ah of hemorrhage (removal of 30% of the calculated blood volume and subsequent titration of mean arterial pressure to 40 mm Hg) 19 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and instrumented pigs received FIO2\u200a=\u200a0.3(control) or hyperoxia(FIO2\u200a=\u200a1.0) during the first 24\u200ah.

One of the most promising activities of this compound is its anticancer and cardioprotective activity that results, at least partially, from its cytoprotective, antioxidant, and chemopreventive properties. The present study investigated the cardioprotective effects of DHS in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats. Isolated hearts were perfused by the Langendorff technique with low dose DHS (100\u202fnM) prior to 30\u202fmin of ischemia induced by coronary artery occlusion. After 60\u202fmin of coronary reperfusion infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining, while lactatedehydrogenase activity was evaluated in perfusate samples collected at several timepoints during the entire perfusion procedure. Signalosomes were isolated from a heart tissue after reperfusion and involved signalling proteins were detected. DHS reduced the extent of infarction compared with untreated control hearts at low concentration; infarct size as proportion of ischemic risk zone was 7.47\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.1% for DHS versus 75.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.8% for ischemia. This protective effect was comparable to infarct limitation induced by ischemic preconditioning (22.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.5%). Selective inhibition of Src-family kinases with PP2 (4-Amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(t-butyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) abrogated the protection afforded by DHS.

We previously reported dose-dependent expansions of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, 24\u00a0h after intratracheal instillation of C-grade, COOH, or N-doped MWCNT in mice. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that airway exposure to MWCNT perturbs cardiovascular adenosinergic signaling, which could contribute to exacerbation of cardiac I/R injury. 100\u00a0\u00b5L of Vehicle or identical suspension volumes containing 100\u00a0\u00b5g of C-grade, COOH, or N-doped MWCNT were instilled into the trachea of CD-1 ICR mice. 1 day later, we measured cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations in cardiac tissue and evaluated arterial adenosinergic smooth muscle signaling mechanisms related to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) in isolated aortic tissue. We also verified cardiac I/R injury expansion and examined both lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity in MWCNT exposed mice. Myocardial cAMP concentrations were reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the C-grade group by 17.4% and N-doped group by 13.7% compared to the Vehicle group. Curve fits to aortic ring 2-Cl-Adenosine concentration responses were significantly greater in the MWCNT groups vs. the Vehicle group. Aortic constrictor responses were more pronounced with NOS inhibition and were abolished with COX inhibition.

The acute infection phase mostly exhibits a non-specific symptomatology. In the absence of treatment, the acute phase is followed by a chronic phase, which is initially asymptomatic. This chronic asymptomatic phase of the disease is characterized by a fragile balance between the host's immune response and the parasite replication. The loss of this balance is crucial for the progression of the sickness. The virulence and tropism of the T. cruzi infecting strain together to the inflammation processes in the cardiac tissue are the main factors for the establishment and severity of the cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of treatment in chronic Chagas disease patients is controversial. However, several studies carried out in chronic patients demonstrated that antiparasitic treatment reduces parasite load in the bloodstream and leads to an improvement in the immune response against the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite. The present review is mainly focused on the cellular patterns associated to the clinical status and the evolution of the disease in chronic patients, as well as the effectiveness of the treatment related to T. cruzi infection control.

Caloric-restriction (CR) is said to decrease the formation of oxidatively modified cellular macromolecules and improve health. On the other hand, some studies indicate that many CR studies are flawed, because ad libitum fed rats are not well-controlled. Thus, it is claimed that purported beneficial effects of CR could be not due to real CR effect, but due to control animals going obese. Also, it remains to be elucidated whether effects of CR could be observed even when CR is started in mid-adulthood. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped as: non-CR 6-month-old rats (n\u2009=\u20097), 24-month-old rats subjected to 40% CR for 6\u00a0months between 18th and 24th\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u20098), and non-CR 24-month-old animals (n\u2009=\u20098). We investigated 16 previously validated biomarkers of macromolecular redox homeostasis, ranging from protein and lipid oxidation to glycation and antioxidative capacity. In the present study, the protein, lipid and antioxidant capacity redox homeostasis biomarkers overwhelmingly indicate that, CR, even though not started very early in adulthood, could still offer potential therapeutic effects and it could significantly improve various redox homeostasis biomarkers associated with disease reliably in the heart tissue of aging male Sprague-Dawley rats.

However, there is scarce published data regarding the appearance of focal deposits of hyaline-like cartilage within the hearts of laboratory rats. Few mechanisms that could trigger the appearance of this type of cartilage in heart were hypothesized (e.g., mechanical stress, ageing). Using different microscopy techniques this report confirms the presence of hyaline cartilage and bone in Wistar rats, which underwent left anterior coronary artery ligation for experimental myocardial infarction. The presented (ultra)structural evidence of focal chondroid metaplasia in the papillary muscles and close to the insertion point in the ventricular mass of the infarcted heart suggests a structural adaptation of cardiac myocardium to the newly acquired kinetics of left ventricular wall, after experimental myocardial infarction. Specific cartilaginous matrix proteins are known to mediate cardiac extracellular matrix remodeling, and this study provides evidence of a complete transition to a cartilaginous pattern in postinfarcted heart, which may nonetheless constitute a supplemental risk factor of a further heart failure condition. Moreover, for heart focal chondrogenesis, we also presume the involvement of the cellular and molecular inflammatory milieu that dominates the first 24 hr border zone landscape of the experimental myocardial infarction lesion.

Despite the apparent health benefits that these diets may provide for insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, their implications on cardiomyocyte oxidative capacity have yet to be investigated. To evaluate the adaptations induced by a 6-week low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet on mitochondrial respiration, two groups of male mice were investigated: Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice on a LCHF diet (L-DIET) and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice on a regular rodent diet (CON). Heart tissue was extracted and used for high-resolution respirometry (HRR), while immunoblotting was performed to quantify mitochondrial density and complexes. The results demonstrate increased expression of all five mitochondrial subunits in the L-DIET group compared to control condition. Furthermore, HRR revealed increased efficiency of substrate consumption, implying augmented oxidative capacity in the L-DIET group. These findings further support the notion that cardiomyocytes prefer lipids as a primary fuel source, by demonstrating that the shift in metabolism caused by a LCHF diet facilitates such an environment. This provides important information regarding the effects of a LCHF on cardiomyocytes, especially when considering free radical production and heart dysfunction.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry", "date": "2018-10-27", "authors": ["CynthiaRocha", "Olivia HKoury", "CelenaScheede-Bergdahl", "AndreasBergdahl"], "doi": "10.1007/s13105-018-0653-x"}

Human heart tissue for isolating cardiac cells is generally hard to obtain, particularly from all four chambers of the same heart. Since different parts of the heart have different functions and therefore may have different immunoregulatory properties, ability to analyse cells from all chambers allows for a unique and comprehensive investigation. Cells were isolated from all four chambers of the heart from patients undergoing cardiac transplantation surgery due to severe chronic heart failure (CHF) (n\u202f=\u202f6). Cells isolated from one donor heart, were used for comparison with the experimental group. Primary cultured human cardiac fibroblasts were treated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response. Cells were also subjected to hypoxia. To determine immunoregulatory properties of the cells, cytokine and chemokine profiles were determined using multiplex ELISA. RESULTS: On average, the fibroblasts population constituted approximately 90% of the expanded non-myocytes. Levels of cytokines and chemokines were markedly increased in human cardiac fibroblasts cultured under inflammatory conditions, with a similar response in fibroblasts from all compartments of the heart. Unexpectedly, hypoxia did not further augment cytokine and chemokine secretion. In conclusion, human cardiac fibroblasts are a robust source of pro-inflammatory mediators in the failing heart, independent of hypoxia, and might play a critical role in inflammation associated with the pathogenesis of CHF.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2018-10-27", "authors": ["JoakimSandstedt", "MikaelSandstedt", "AnnikaLundqvist", "M\u00e4rtaJansson", "Victoria RotterSopasakis", "AndersJeppsson", "Lillemor MattssonHult\u00e9n"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2018.09.021"}

{"title": "TFAM overexpression reduces pathological cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a functional lack of myocardial performance due to a loss of molecular control over increases in calcium and ROS, resulting in proteolytic degradative advances and cardiac remodeling. Mitochondria are the molecular powerhouse of cells, shifting the sphere of cardiomyocyte stability and performance. Functional mitochondria rely on the molecular abilities of safety factors such as TFAM to maintain physiological parameters. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) creates a mitochondrial nucleoid structure around mtDNA, protecting it from mutation, inhibiting NFAT (ROS activator/hypertrophic stimulator), and transcriptionally activates Serca2a to decrease calcium mishandling. Calpain1 and MMP9 are proteolytic degratory factors that play a major role in cardiomyocyte decline in HF. Current literature depicts major decreases in TFAM as HF progresses. We aim to assess TFAM function against Calpain1 and MMP9 proteolytic activity and its role in cardiac remodeling. To this date, no publication has surfaced describing the effects of aortic banding (AB) as a surgical HF model in TFAM-TG mice. HF models were created via AB in TFAM transgenic (TFAM-TG) and C57BLJ-6 (WT) mice. Eight weeks post AB, functional analysis revealed a successful banding procedure, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy as observed via echocardiography. Pulse wave and color doppler show increased aortic flow rates as well as turbulent flow at the banding site. Preliminary results of cardiac tissue immuno-histochemistry of HF-control mice show decreased TFAM and compensatory increases in Serca2a fluorescent expression, along with increased Calpain1 and MMP9 expression. Protein, RNA, and IHC analysis will further assess TFAM-TG results post-banding. Echocardiography shows more cardiac stability and functionality in HF-induced TFAM-TG mice than the control counterpart. These findings complement our published in vitro results.

The motivation for developing accurate, predictive models is twofold: first, to study and discover new treatments for cardiac pathologies which are leading in worldwide morbidity and mortality rates; and second, to screen for adverse drug reactions on the heart, a primary risk in drug development. In addition to in vivo animal models, in vitro and in silico models have been recently proposed to mimic the physiological conditions of heart and vasculature.

Cardiac dysfunction, an important consequence of sepsis, affects mortality. We previously reported that thymoquinone (TQ) protected against hyperlipidemia and doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage. This study investigated the possible protective effects of TQ against cardiac damage in septic BALB/c mice. Eight-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control, TQ, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and TQ\u2009+\u2009CLP. CLP was performed after 2-week TQ gavage. After 48\u00a0h, we measured the histopathological alterations of the cardiac tissue and the plasma levels of troponin-T (cTnT) and ATP. We evaluated autophagy (p62 and beclin 1), pyroptosis (NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, and IL-18) at the gene and protein levels and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) at the gene level. Our results demonstrated that TQ administration significantly reduced intestinal histological alterations. TQ inhibited plasma cTnT levels; improved ATP; significantly inhibited p62, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1expressions; and increased beclin 1 and IL-10 level. The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase level was significantly decreased in the TQ\u2009+\u2009CLP group versus the CLP group.

{"title": "Proteasome biology and therapeutics in cardiac diseases.", "abstract": "The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the major pathway for intracellular protein degradation in most organs, including the heart. UPS controls many fundamental biological processes such as cell cycle, cell division, immune responses, antigen presentation, apoptosis, and cell signaling. The UPS not only degrades substrates but also regulates activity of gene transcription at the post-transcription level. Emerging evidence suggests that impairment of UPS function is sufficient to cause a number of cardiac diseases, including heart failure, cardiomyopathies, hypertrophy, atrophy, ischemia-reperfusion, and atherosclerosis. Alterations in the expression of UPS components, changes in proteasomal peptidase activities and increased ubiquitinated and oxidized proteins have also been detected in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the pathophysiological role of the UPS in DCM has not been examined. Recently, in vitro and in vivo studies have proven highly valuable in assessing effects of various stressors on the UPS and, in some cases, suggesting a causal link between defective protein clearance and disease phenotypes in different cardiac diseases, including DCM. Translation of these findings to human disease can be greatly strengthened by corroboration of discoveries from experimental model systems using human heart tissue from well-defined patient populations.

Myocardial dysfunction, often termed sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, is a frequent complication and is associated with worse outcomes. Numerous mechanisms contribute to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and a growing body of evidence suggests that bioenergetic and metabolic derangements play a central role in its development; however, there are significant discrepancies in the literature, perhaps reflecting variability in the experimental models employed or in the host response to sepsis. The condition is characterised by lack of significant cell death, normal tissue oxygen levels and, in survivors, reversibility of organ dysfunction.

However, the molecular mediators of resveratrol-induced cardiac benefits are still not fully disclosed. Present study aims to investigate whether estrogen-related receptor (ERR)-\u03b1, an orphan nuclear receptor, determines the protective benefits of resveratrol in obesity-related cardiomyopathy. Through high fat diet-fed mouse model, our results show resveratrol increases cardiac ERR-\u03b1 level and attenuates diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondrial inactivity and inflammatory response. Co-administration of lentivirus encoding Err-\u03b1 siRNA abolishes these benefits, such as enlargement of cardiomyocyte size, induction of left ventricular dysfunction and structural disorders. More importantly, we firstly find resveratrol stimulates the cardiac mitochondrial activities, but silencing Err-\u03b1 decreased mitochondrial function on ATP production, oxygen consumption and complex I activity. Besides, Err-\u03b1 deficiency also reverses resveratrol-mediated suppression of inflammatory response in cardiac tissues.

Especially in combination with the stem cell technology, these in vitro models of the human heart have generated interest not only of basic cardiovascular researchers but also of regulatory authorities responsible for drug safety. A main limitation of 3D-based assays for evaluating cardiotoxicity is their limited throughput. We integrated piezo-bending actuators in a 24-well system for the generation of strip-like rat and human EHT attached to hollow, elastic silicone posts. Muscle contractions of EHTs induced a measurable electrical current in the piezo-bending actuators that could be analysed for contraction amplitude, frequency, and contraction and relaxation kinetics. Compared with the standard video-optical analysis of contractile activity, the new system allows for (a) the analysis of several tissues in parallel, (b) switching between auxotonic and isometric contractions by inserting a stiff metal post in the silicone post opposing the piezo actuator, (c) continuous measurement over days with low data volume (megabyte), (d) automated measurement without the necessity of adjustment of tissue position for video-optical analysis, (e) reduced complexity and costs, (f) high sensitivity of contraction detection, (g) calculation of absolute contraction force, and (h) suitability for variable tissue geometries.

Although crests were observed in nearly all CMs from all heart compartments in all species, we showed that their heights, dictated by the subsarcolemmal mitochondria number, substantially differ between compartments from one species to another and tightly correlate with the sarcomere length. Differences in crest heights also exist between species; for example, the similar cardiac compartments in cows and humans exhibit higher crests than rodents. Unexpectedly, we found that lateral surface crests establish tight junctional contacts with crests from neighbouring CMs. Consistently, super-resolution SIM or STED-based immunofluorescence imaging of the cardiac tissue revealed intermittent claudin-5-claudin-5 interactions in trans via their extracellular part and crossing the basement membrane. Finally, we found a loss of crest structures and crest-crest contacts in diseased human CMs and in an experimental mouse model of left ventricle barometric overload.\nOverall, these results provide the first evidence for the existence of differential CM surface crests in the cardiac tissue as well as the existence of CM-CM direct physical contacts at their lateral face through crest-crest interactions. We propose a model in which this specific 3D organization of the CM lateral membrane ensures the myofibril/myofiber alignment and the overall cardiac tissue cohesion. A potential role in the control of sarcomere relaxation and of diastolic ventricular dysfunction is also discussed.

The ultimate goal is to prevent the progression of heart failure and apoptotic processes. Cardiac tissue may regenerate itself but to certain extent depending on the number of resident stem cells that is limited. Thus, research had been focused on bone marrow derived stem cells (BM-MSCs) as a promising therapy in different types of tissues, including the heart. This study is designed not only to assess the therapeutic effect of BM-MSCs but also to improve their therapeutic effect in combination with antioxidant \u03b1-lipoic acid (ALA) and antihypertensive therapeutic drug form (AP) against isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury and compared with that of BM-MSCs alone. Cardiac injury was induced in 70 male rats by Isoproterenol (ISO was injected s.c. for four consecutive days). Experimental animals were divided into six ISO-treated groups beside a control non treated one. The six ISO-treated groups were divided into: ISO group, ISO+BM-MSCs group, ISO+ALA group, ISO+AP group, ISO+ALA+AP group and ISO+ALA+AP+BM-MSCs group, the last five groups were treated with the examined materials after one week of ISO injection. Isoproterenol significantly increased serum CK-MB, LDH activities, Troponin1 and TNF-\u03b1. Oxidative stress is evidenced by the increased MDA, NO and Caspase-3 activity associated with significant reduction of GSH content and SOD activity in cardiac tissue. Furthermore, mRNA expression of NF\u03baB and iNOS were significantly up regulated and eNOS mRNA expression was down regulated. Administration of BM-MSCs, ALA and AP alone significantly mitigated the induced cardiac injury.

{"title": "A novel murine model for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy points to a pathogenic role of Wnt signalling and miRNA dysregulation.", "abstract": "Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is one of the most common inherited cardiomyopathies, characterized by progressive fibro-fatty replacement in the myocardium. Clinically, AC manifests itself with ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden death and shows wide inter- and intra-familial variability. Among the causative genes identified so far, those encoding for the desmosomal proteins plakophilin-2 (PKP2), desmoplakin (DSP), and desmoglein-2 (DSG2) are the most commonly mutated. So far, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) behind such a varied spectrum of phenotypes, although it has been shown that the causative mutations not only lead to structural abnormalities but also affect the miRNA profiling of cardiac tissue. Here, we aimed at studying the pathogenic effects of a nonsense mutation of the desmoglein-2 gene, both at the structural level and in terms of miRNA expression pattern.\nWe generated transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a FLAG-tagged human desmoglein-2 harbouring the Q558* nonsense mutation found in an AC patient. The hearts of these mice showed signs of fibrosis, decrease in desmosomal size and number, and reduction of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. Genome-wide RNA-Seq performed in Tg-hQ hearts and non-transgenic hearts revealed that 24 miRNAs were dysregulated in transgenic animals. Further bioinformatic analyses for selected miRNAs suggested that miR-217-5p, miR-499-5p, and miR-708-5p might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.\nDown-regulation of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling might be considered a common key event in the AC pathogenesis.

In this study, an acquisition-reconstruction technique that makes use of the MB data to calculate these reference data is presented. The method was integrated into a 2D time-resolved phase-contrast MR sequence used to assess velocities of the myocardium.\nThe RF phases of the MB pulse are cycled through time so that consecutive cardiac phases can be grouped to form reference scans at a lower temporal resolution. These reference data are subsequently used to separate the original slices at the original, high temporal resolution using slice/split-slice GRAPPA algorithms. Slice separation performances are evaluated and compared with conventional methods at 3\u00a0T, and 3 different strategies for the calibration of the kernels are proposed and compared. Finally, 6 subjects were scanned to assess velocities of the myocardium.\nBecause the acquisition of external references is not needed, no additional breath-holds are required and the full MB acceleration could be exploited. Because the reference and MB data have the same resolution and phase structure, better slice separation was achieved when comparing the proposed technique to conventional workflows. Finally, time-resolved velocities of the myocardial tissue were successfully quantified from MB data, showing good agreement with single-band measurements.\nOur built-in reference method allows the full exploitation of the MB acceleration and it limits the number of breath-holds.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2018-10-09", "authors": ["GiulioFerrazzi", "Jean PierreBassenge", "ClarissaWink", "AlexanderRuh", "MichaelMarkl", "SteenMoeller", "Gregory JMetzger", "BerndIttermann", "SebastianSchmitter"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.27460"}

Usually, BC or BC-containing carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were recognized as non-directly toxic components of atmospheric particulate matter. However, epidemiology studies have provided much evidence of the associations of exposure of particulate-containing carbon particles with cardiovascular diseases. There are still no related studies to support the epidemiological conclusions. Hence, in this article we exposed adult zebrafish to CNPs for 60\u00a0days, and then explored the heart location and potential adverse effects on cardiac tissues of these nanosized carbon particles. Our results first showed direct visualization of cardiac endothelial uptake and heart deposition of CNPs in zebrafish. In addition, CNPs caused significant ultrastructural alterations in myocardial tissue and induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in sub-endocardial inflammation and cell apoptosis. Moreover, our data demonstrated the perturbations caused by CNPs on DNA methylation, suggesting that DNA methylome remodeling might play a critical role in CNP-induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish heart.

In most of the described cases, pericarditis occurs as a delayed complication. We present a case of a 21-year-old white woman who was seen in the emergency department to rule out pulmonary embolism for shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. The autopsy showed a collection of serous fluid into the pericardial sac with bread-and-butter appearance. Microscopically, the pericardium showed acute inflammation with fibrinous exudates. Sections of the heart showed areas of lymphocytic infiltration with acute fibrinous inflammation of the pericardium. Vasculitis was seen in small blood vessels in the heart and was negative in other organs. No granuloma or necrotizing lesion was seen in microscopic sections of all organs including the heart, ruling out rheumatologic disease.

In this study, cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells) were cultured in hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation in normoxia or hyperoxia. Cardiomyocyte OS, inflammation, and apoptosis were measured. In parallel experiments, rabbits were cannulated for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Following cardioplegic arrest and aortic cross-clamp removal, hearts were reperfused under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. Left ventricular developed pressure and contractility (LV +dP/dt) were recorded, and blood samples and heart tissues were collected for measurement of OS, inflammation, and cardiac injury. Results showed that H9c2 cells exposed to hyperoxic reoxygenation showed significant increases in OS, inflammation, and apoptosis compared to normoxic reoxygenation. Following CPB and 2-hour hyperoxic reperfusion, LV +dP/dt and left ventricular developed pressure were significantly decreased compared with pre-CPB values (to 36 \u00b1 21%, P = 0.002; and 53 \u00b1 20%, P\u202f=\u202f0.02, respectively), associated with significant increases in all plasma and tissue biomarkers for OS, inflammation, and myocardial injury. In contrast, LV +dP/dt was relatively well preserved under normoxic reperfusion conditions (to 70 \u00b1 14% after 2-hour reperfusion), and was associated with an attenuated myocardial OS, inflammatory, apoptotic, and injury response compared to the hyperoxia group (eg, cTn-I: 5.9 \u00b1 1.5 vs 20.2 \u00b1 7.6 ng/mL, respectively, P < 0.0001). Overall, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, normoxic reperfusion/reoxygenation was associated with less robust OS, inflammation, apoptosis, and myocardial injury compared with hyperoxic reperfusion/reoxygenation.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the structural integrity and biocompatibility of the bovine pericardium (BP) after a soft decellularization process with a 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, with the aim to remove xenoantigens and preserve extracellular matrix (ECM) bioactivity. The decellularization process promoted a mean reduction of 77% of the amount of DNA in the samples in which cell nuclei staining was undetectable. The ECM content was maintained as mostly preserved after decellularization as well as its biomechanical properties. In addition, the decellularization protocol has proven to be efficient in removing the xenoantigen alpha-gal, which is responsible for immune rejection. The decellularized BP was noncytotoxic in vitro and allowed human adipose-derived stem cell (hASC) adhesion. Finally, after 7\u00a0days in culture, the tissue scaffold became repopulated by hASCs, and after 30\u00a0days, the ECM protein pro-collagen I was seen in the scaffold.

Hydrogels possessed a highly porous structure with irregular pores interconnected throughout the construct as shown by SEM, and liposomes distributed uniformly in the porous structure. A sustained AT release was observed in AT-LCH. In addition, AT-LCH has shown an excellent biocompatibility to support the adhesion and survival of cardiomyocytes.

We previously reported that cardiomyocyte B56\u03b1 localizes to myofilaments under resting conditions and translocates to the cytosol in response to acute \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) stimulation. Given the importance of reversible protein phosphorylation in modulating cardiac function during sympathetic stimulation, we hypothesized that loss of B56\u03b1 in mice with targeted disruption of the gene encoding B56\u03b1 (Ppp2r5a) would impact on cardiac responses to \u03b2-AR stimulation in vivo.\nCardiac phenotype of mice heterozygous (HET) or homozygous (HOM) for the disrupted Ppp2r5a allele and wild type (WT) littermates was characterized under basal conditions and following acute \u03b2-AR stimulation with dobutamine (DOB; 0.75\u2009mg/kg i.p.) or sustained \u03b2-AR stimulation by 2-week infusion of isoproterenol (ISO; 30\u2009mg/kg/day s.c.). Left ventricular (LV) wall thicknesses, chamber dimensions and function were assessed by echocardiography, and heart tissue collected for gravimetric, histological, and biochemical analyses. Western blot analysis revealed partial and complete loss of B56\u03b1 protein in hearts from HET and HOM mice, respectively, and no changes in the expression of other PP2A regulatory, catalytic or scaffolding subunits. PP2A catalytic activity was reduced in hearts of both HET and HOM mice. There were no differences in the basal cardiac phenotype between genotypes. Acute DOB stimulation induced the expected inotropic response in WT and HET mice, which was attenuated in HOM mice. In contrast, DOB-induced increases in heart rate were unaffected by B56\u03b1 deficiency. In WT mice, ISO infusion increased LV wall thicknesses, cardiomyocyte area and ventricular mass, without LV dilation, systolic dysfunction, collagen deposition or foetal gene expression. The hypertrophic response to ISO was blunted in mice deficient for B56\u03b1.\nThese findings identify B56\u03b1 as a potential regulator of cardiac structure and function during \u03b2-AR stimulation.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2018-09-12", "authors": ["Sarah-LenaPuhl", "Kate LWeeks", "AlicanG\u00fcran", "AntonellaRanieri", "PeterBoknik", "UweKirchhefer", "Frank UM\u00fcller", "MetinAvkiran"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvy230"}

TSA-1 with the TLR-4 agonists was effective at reducing parasitemia relative to rTSA-1 alone, although it was difficult to discern a therapeutic effect compared to treatment with TLR-4 agonists alone. However, rTSA-1 with a 10 ug dose of MPLA optimized reductions in cardiac tissue inflammation, which were significantly reduced compared to MPLA alone. It also elicited the lowest parasite burden and the highest levels of TSA-1-specific IFN-gamma levels and IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratios.

Studies have proposed that increased level of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines following radiotherapy or radiation events play a key role in the development of several side effects such as cardiovascular disorders. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines as well as signaling pathways such as IL4Ra1, IL13Ra2, Duox1 and Duox2. In addition, we detected the possible protective effect of curcumin on the expression of these factors and infiltration of inflammatory cells.\nTwenty rats were divided into 4 groups including control; curcumin treated; radiation; and radiation plus curcumin. After 10 weeks, rats were sacrificed for evaluation of mentioned parameters.\nResults showed an increase in the level of IL-4 and all evaluated genes, as well as increased infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. Treatment with curcumin could attenuate these changes.\nCurcumin could reduce radiation-induced heart injury markers in rats.", "journal": "Current radiopharmaceuticals", "date": "2018-09-04", "authors": ["SedigheKolivand", "PeymanAmini", "HanaSaffar", "SaeedRezapoor", "ElaheMotevaseli", "MasoudNajafi", "FarzadNouruzi", "DheyauldeenShabeeb", "Ahmed EleojoMusa"], "doi": "10.2174/1874471011666180831101459"}

The current materials are unable to grow and result in scarring, contraction, and arrhythmias. An acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) patch derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa has demonstrated remodeling potential when used to repair various tissues. This study investigated the in vivo electrophysiologic, mechanical, and histological properties of an ECM patch used to repair a right-ventricular (RV) wall defect in a growing ovine model. A full-thickness, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092\u2009cm RV defect was created in 11 juvenile sheep and repaired with an ECM patch. Longitudinal RV three-dimensional-electrical mapping, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histological analysis were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Three-dimensional mapping demonstrated consistent conduction across the patch with little to no difference in voltage, but conduction velocity was consistently less than native myocardium. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed changing strain properties of the patch which by 9-12 months resembled native tissue. Histologic analysis at 3 months demonstrates cardiomyocyte degeneration and partial replacement via proliferation of connective tissue cells that were predominately fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. There was marked neovascularization and an absence of calcification at 12 months. Over time, the ECM patch remained viable with stable muscle at the edges. In growing sheep, an ECM patch becomes a viable tissue and remains so up to at least a year.

{"title": "Molecular discoveries and treatment strategies by direct reprogramming in cardiac regeneration.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue has minimal endogenous regenerative capacity in response to injury. Treatment options are limited following tissue damage after events such as myocardial infarction. Current strategies are aimed primarily at injury prevention, but attention has been increasingly targeted toward the development of regenerative therapies. This review focuses on recent developments in the field of cardiac fibroblast reprogramming into induced cardiomyocytes. Early efforts to produce cardiac regeneration centered around induced pluripotent stem cells, but clinical translation has proved elusive. Currently, techniques are being developed to directly transdifferentiate cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes. Viral vector-driven expression of a combination of transcription factors including Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 induced cardiomyocyte development in mice. Subsequent combinational modifications have extended these results to human cell lines and increased efficacy. The miRNAs including combinations of miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, and miR-499 can improve or independently drive regeneration of cardiomyocytes. Similar results could be obtained by combinations of small molecules with or without transcription factor or miRNA expression. The local tissue environment greatly impacts favorability for reprogramming. Modulation of signaling pathways, especially those mediated by VEGF and TGF-\u03b2, enhance differentiation to cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Anti-fibrotic Actions of Roselle Extract in Rat Model of Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Heart failure-associated morbidity and mortality is largely attributable to extensive and unregulated cardiac remodelling. Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) calyces are enriched with natural polyphenols known for antioxidant and anti-hypertensive effects, yet its effects on early cardiac remodelling in post myocardial infarction (MI) setting are still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the actions of roselle extract on cardiac remodelling in rat model of MI. Male Wistar rats (200-300\u00a0g) were randomly allotted into three groups: Control, MI, and MI\u2009+\u2009Roselle. MI was induced with isoprenaline (ISO) (85\u00a0mg/kg, s.c) for two consecutive days followed by roselle treatment (100\u00a0mg/kg, orally) for 7\u00a0days. Isoprenaline administration showed changes in heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) ratio. MI was especially evident by the elevated cardiac injury marker, troponin-T, and histological observation. Upregulation of plasma levels and cardiac gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 was seen in MI rats. A relatively high percentage of fibrosis was observed in rat heart tissues with over-expression of collagen (Col)-1 and Col-3 genes following isoprenaline-induced MI. On top of that, cardiomyocyte areas were larger in heart tissues of MI rats with upregulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression, indicating cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, roselle supplementation attenuated elevation of plasma troponin-T, IL-6, IL10, and gene expression level of IL-10. Furthermore, reduction of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy were observed. In conclusion, roselle treatment was able to limit early cardiac remodelling in MI rat model by alleviating inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy; hence, the potential application of roselle in early adjunctive treatment to prevent heart failure.", "journal": "Cardiovascular toxicology", "date": "2018-08-22", "authors": ["Shafreena ShaukatAli", "Siti Fatimah AzaharahMohamed", "Nur HafiqahRozalei", "Yap WeiBoon", "SatirahZainalabidin"], "doi": "10.1007/s12012-018-9478-7"}

They maintain cardiovascular homeostasis by binding to natriuretic peptide receptor-A. Since plasma ANP and BNP concentrations, as well as expression, are elevated in response to increased body fluid volume and pressure load on the heart wall, these peptides are widely utilized as diagnostic biomarkers for evaluating heart failure. Regardless of their high utility, differences in their molecular forms between healthy and diseased subjects and how these relate to pathophysiology have not well been examined. Recent studies have shown that the circulating molecular forms of ANP and BNP are not uniform; bioactive \u03b1-ANP is the major ANP form, whereas the weakly active proBNP is the major BNP form. The relative ratios of the different molecular forms are altered under different pathophysiological conditions. These facts indicate that detailed measurements of each form may provide useful information on the pathophysiological state of heart tissue. Here, we revisit the relationship between the molecular forms of, and pathophysiological alterations in, human ANP and BNP and discuss the possible utility of the measurement of each of the molecular forms. The third peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide, activates natriuretic peptide receptor-B, but little is known about its production and function in the heart because of its extremely low levels.

They undergo a reorganization or partial transformation to myofibroblasts during this process, which precedes scar formation within the infarcted heart in\u00a0vivo. Here, we induce wound formation in an in\u00a0vitro system as a model for these fibrotic conditions: we assessed the dynamics of wound healing in co-cultures of fibroblasts and myocytes upon targeted wound initiation using Electric Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) under optical control. We discovered distinct wound closure dynamics for mono- and co-cultures of myocytes and fibroblasts and observed a cessation of the contractile behavior for recovering cardiomyocyte cultures. We furthermore identified a change of cellular impedance for recovering fibroblasts and the presence of \u03b1-SMA, suggesting a partial transformation into myofibroblasts. This was concomitant with a modulation of connectivity, cell-substrate dynamics and membrane capacitance of all wounded cell cultures. Qualitatively, connexin 43 observation confirmed the ECIS trend found for cell-cell connectivity. Finally, we were able to validate the ECIS based wounding approach against an ECIS based barrier assay - the so-called electric fence.

Male rats were subjected to 30\u2009min ischemia and 2\u2009h reperfusion in the presence or absence of sevoflurane (1.0 minimum alveolar concentration) during the first 15\u2009min of reperfusion. We found that SPC significantly improved hemodynamic performance after reperfusion, alleviated postischemic myocardial infarction, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide content loss, and cytochrome c release in heart tissues. Furthermore, SPC significantly increased the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase, and elevated myocardial NOS activity and NO production. All these effects were abolished by treatment with an NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10\u2009mg/kg, i.v.). We also observed myocardial I/R-induced accumulation of autophagosomes in heart tissues, as evidenced by increased ratios of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II/I, up-regulation of Beclin 1 and P62, and reduced lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 expression. SPC significantly attenuated I/R-impaired autophagic flux, which were blocked by L-NAME. Moreover, pretreatment with the autophagic flux blocker chloroquine (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) increased autophagosome accumulation in SPC-treated heart following I/R and blocked SPC-induced cardioprotection. The same results were also observed in a rat model of myocardial I/R injury ex vivo, suggesting that SPC protects rat hearts against myocardial reperfusion injury by restoring I/R-impaired autophagic flux via an NO-dependent mechanism.", "journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "date": "2018-07-14", "authors": ["Shi-GangQiao", "YingSun", "BoSun", "AnWang", "JiaQiu", "LeiHong", "Jian-ZhongAn", "ChenWang", "Hui-LingZhang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41401-018-0066-y\n10.1152/ajpheart.01064.2002\n10.3892/ijmm.2015.2366\n10.1042/CS20100435\n10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.11.006\n10.3892/mmr.2015.3533\n10.3390/ijms18030614\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002416\n10.1371/journal.pone.0134666\n10.1089/ars.2010.3488\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.041814\n10.1038/aps.2014.20\n10.1038/cddis.2016.108\n10.1097/ALN.0000000000000807\n10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c4a607\n10.1111/iej.12616\n10.1111/liv.13476\n10.1038/aps.2014.78\n10.1007/s00540-012-1494-3\n10.1097/CCM.0000000000001350\n10.1097/01.fjc.0000175238.18702.40\n10.1155/2016/3453059\n10.1038/aps.2012.27\n10.1016/j.lfs.2016.02.094\n10.1007/s00018-004-4125-9\n10.1186/s13578-016-0089-3\n10.1021/bi00221a023\n10.1006/abbi.2000.2201\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.11.003\n10.1074/jbc.M006825200\n10.1161/01.RES.0000261924.76669.36\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.017\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.11.008\n10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005183\n10.1093/rheumatology/ket471\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2014.06.005"}

{"title": "Mst1 promotes cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting the ERK-CREB pathway and repressing FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy.", "abstract": "Cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury results mainly from mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte death. Mitophagy sustains mitochondrial function and exerts a pro-survival effect on the reperfused heart tissue. Mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (Mst1) regulates chronic cardiac metabolic damage and autophagic activity, but its role in acute cardiac I/R injury, especially its effect on mitophagy, is unknown. The aim of this study is to explore whether Mst1 is involved in reperfusion-mediated cardiomyocyte death via modulation of FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1)-related mitophagy. Our data indicated that Mst1 was markedly increased in reperfused hearts. However, genetic ablation of Mst1 in Mst1-knockout (Mst1-KO) mice significantly reduced the expansion of the cardiac infarction area, maintained myocardial function and abolished I/R-mediated cardiomyocyte death. At the molecular level, upregulation of Mst1 promoted ROS production, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, facilitated the leakage of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors into the nucleus, and activated the caspase-9-related apoptotic pathway in reperfused cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, Mst1 activation repressed FUNDC1 expression and consequently inhibited mitophagy. However, deletion of Mst1 was able to reverse FUNDC1 expression and thus re-activate protective mitophagy, effectively sustaining mitochondrial homeostasis and blocking mitochondrial apoptosis in reperfused cardiomyocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that Mst1 regulated FUNDC1 expression via the MAPK/ERK-CREB pathway. Inhibition of the MAPK/ERK-CREB pathway prevented FUNDC1 activation caused by Mst1 deletion. Altogether, our data confirm that Mst1 deficiency sends a pro-survival signal for the reperfused heart by reversing FUNDC1-related mitophagy and thus reducing cardiomyocyte mitochondrial apoptosis, which identifies Mst1 as a novel regulator for cardiac reperfusion injury via modulation of mitochondrial homeostasis.", "journal": "The journal of physiological sciences : JPS", "date": "2018-07-02", "authors": ["WanchengYu", "MeiXu", "TaoZhang", "QianZhang", "ChengweiZou"], "doi": "10.1007/s12576-018-0627-3\n10.1111/jpi.12471\n10.1007/s00395-017-0607-4\n10.1116/1.4953246\n10.1007/s00395-017-0600-y\n10.1111/jpi.12419\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.004\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.03.035\n10.1007/s12192-017-0827-4\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.012\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.017\n10.1038/s41418-018-0086-7\n10.1007/s00395-018-0682-1\n10.7554/eLife.21407\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.07.007\n10.1007/s10456-018-9611-z\n10.1111/jpi.12438\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.07.004\n10.1080/15548627.2017.1300224\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.01.020\n10.1007/s00395-017-0657-7\n10.1007/s10456-016-9535-4\n10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.11.010\n10.1007/s10456-016-9528-3\n10.1111/jpi.12503\n10.1007/s00395-017-0609-2\n10.1007/s00395-017-0601-x\n10.1007/s10456-017-9542-0\n10.1111/jpi.12414\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2017.05.007\n10.1159/000477886\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.02.001\n10.1111/jpi.12404\n10.1007/s10456-016-9538-1\n10.1038/cdd.2016.119\n10.1111/jpi.12380\n10.1016/j.redox.2016.12.022\n10.1007/s00395-017-0604-7\n10.1016/j.redox.2018.02.019\n10.1038/cdd.2016.159\n10.1007/s00395-016-0596-8\n10.1007/s10456-017-9540-2\n10.1007/s12576-016-0473-0\n10.1007/s10456-017-9554-9\n10.1186/s11658-018-0085-1\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2018.03.012\n10.1007/s12576-017-0549-5\n10.1007/s00395-017-0621-6\n10.1007/s10456-016-9525-6\n10.1111/jpi.12372\n10.1111/jpi.12450\n10.1007/s10456-016-9531-8\n10.1007/s12576-016-0493-9\n10.1007/s00395-017-0626-1\n10.1159/000487450\n10.1186/s11658-018-0081-5\n10.1016/j.redox.2017.08.013\n10.1007/s12576-016-0492-x"}

Myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis drive cardiac remodelling and heart failure, but they are not sufficiently inhibited by current treatment strategies. Furthermore, despite increasing knowledge on cardiomyocyte intracellular signalling proteins inducing pathological hypertrophy, therapeutic approaches to target these molecules are currently unavailable. In this study, we aimed to establish and test a therapeutic tool to counteract the 22\u2009kDa calcium and integrin binding protein (CIB) 1, which we have previously identified as nodal regulator of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and as activator of the maladaptive calcineurin/NFAT axis.\nAmong three different sequences, we selected a shRNA construct (shCIB1) to specifically down-regulate CIB1 by 50% upon adenoviral overexpression in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM), and upon overexpression by an adeno-associated-virus (AAV) 9 vector in mouse hearts. Overexpression of shCIB1 in NRCM markedly reduced cellular growth, improved contractility of bioartificial cardiac tissue and reduced calcineurin/NFAT activation in response to hypertrophic stimulation. In mice, administration of AAV-shCIB1 strongly ameliorated eccentric cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction during 2 weeks of pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Ultrastructural and molecular analyses revealed markedly reduced myocardial fibrosis, inhibition of hypertrophy associated gene expression and calcineurin/NFAT as well as ERK MAP kinase activation after TAC in AAV-shCIB1 vs. AAV-shControl treated mice. During long-term exposure to pressure overload for 10\u2009weeks, AAV-shCIB1 treatment maintained its anti-hypertrophic and anti-fibrotic effects, but cardiac function was no longer improved vs. AAV-shControl treatment, most likely resulting from a reduction in myocardial angiogenesis upon downregulation of CIB1.\nInhibition of CIB1 by a shRNA-mediated gene therapy potently inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis during pressure overload.

Furthermore, we found that early Gb3 deposits were mostly confined within lysosomes, while they appeared extralysosomally at a later stage.\nA significant amount of lysosomal Gb3 deposits could be detected by IF staining in cardiac tissue before the formation of inclusion bodies, suggesting the cardiomyocytes might have been experiencing cellular stress and damage early on, before the appearance of typical pathological changes of FD during the disease progression.", "journal": "Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics", "date": "2018-06-08", "authors": ["Ming-JiaHsu", "Fu-PangChang", "Yung-HsiuLu", "Sheng-CheHung", "Yu-ChenWang", "An-HangYang", "Han-JuiLee", "Shih-HsienSung", "Yen-FengWang", "Wen-ChungYu", "Ting-RongHsu", "Po-HsunHuang", "Sheng-KaiChang", "IvanDzhagalov", "Chia-LinHsu", "Dau-MingNiu"], "doi": "10.1038/s41436-018-0010-z\n10.1186/1750-1172-5-30\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.11.004\n10.7326/0003-4819-138-4-200302180-00014\n10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00160.x\n10.1056/NEJM199102073240607\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.09.023\n10.1038/jhg.2013.48\n10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.109.862920\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61266-X\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.01.031\n10.1086/504601\n10.1007/8904_2012_130\n10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.01.051\n10.1056/NEJM199508033330504\n10.1016/j.jacc.2016.09.943\n10.1007/s00428-007-0468-6\n10.1038/mt.2009.220\n10.1186/1750-1172-9-96\n10.1006/abbi.1994.1144\n10.1073/pnas.051634498\n10.1007/s10038-005-0342-9\n10.1007/s10741-014-9452-9\n10.1136/jmg.2008.065904\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.11.001\n10.1016/j.ymgme.2013.02.003\n10.1016/j.cjca.2015.10.033\n10.1161/01.ATV.0000209649.60409.38\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehp387\n10.1007/BF02889849\n10.1038/labinvest.3700484\n10.3389/fnagi.2014.00177\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.11.087\n10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.06.019\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.794529\n10.1016/j.jjcc.2007.12.001\n10.1016/j.carpath.2004.12.001\n10.1097/01.rct.0000236416.05267.6c"}

Although some studies demonstrated the adverse effects of TRZ related to cardiovascular system, the conflicting results were observed in these studies. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cardiac adverse effects of TRZ in rats at repeated doses in our study. In accordance with this purpose, TRZ was administered orally to rats at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg doses for 28 days. Electrocardiogram records, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-myoglobin band, cardiac troponin-T (cTn-T) levels, DNA damage in cardiomyocytes, and histologic view of heart tissues were evaluated. In addition, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured to determine the oxidative status of cardiac tissue after TRZ administration. Heart rate was decreased, PR interval was prolonged, and QRS and T amplitudes were decreased in 20 mg/kg TRZ-administered group compared to the control group. Serum AST and cTn-T levels were significantly increased in 10 and 20 mg/kg TRZ-administered rats with respect to control rats. DNA damage was significantly increased in these groups. Additionally, degenerative histopathologic findings were observed in TRZ-administered groups. Although there was no difference in MDA levels between groups, GSH levels were significantly decreased in 10 and 20 mg/kg TRZ-administered groups compared to the control group. Our results have shown that TRZ induced cardiotoxicity in rats dose-dependently.

{"title": "Deletion of delta-like 1 homologue accelerates fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation and induces myocardial fibrosis.", "abstract": "Myocardial fibrosis is associated with profound changes in ventricular architecture and geometry, resulting in diminished cardiac function. There is currently no information on the role of the delta-like homologue 1 (Dlk1) in the regulation of the fibrotic response. Here, we investigated whether Dlk1 is involved in cardiac fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation and regulates myocardial fibrosis and explored the molecular mechanism underpinning its effects in this process.\nUsing Dlk1-knockout mice and adenoviral gene delivery, we demonstrate that overexpression of Dlk1 in cardio-fibroblasts resulted in inhibition of fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts. This process is mediated by TGF-\u03b21 signalling, since isolated fibroblasts lacking Dlk1 exhibited a higher activation of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad-3 pathway at baseline, leading to an earlier acquisition of a myofibroblast phenotype. Likewise, Dlk1-null mice displayed increased TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 cardiac activity, resulting in infiltration/accumulation of myofibroblasts, induction and deposition of extra-domain A-fibronectin isoform and collagen, and activation of pro-fibrotic markers. Furthermore, these profibrotic events were associated with disrupted myofibril integrity, myocyte hypertrophy, and cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, Dlk1 expression was down-regulated in ischaemic human and porcine heart tissues. Mechanistically, miR-370 mediated Dlk1's regulation of cardiac fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation by directly targeting TGF\u03b2-R2/Smad-3 signalling, while the Dlk1 canonical target, Notch pathway, does not seem to play a role in this process.\nThese findings are the first to demonstrate an inhibitory role of Dlk1 of cardiac fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation by interfering with TGF\u03b2/Smad-3 signalling in the myocardium. Given the deleterious effects of continuous activation of this pathway, we propose Dlk1 as a new potential candidate for therapy in cases where aberrant TGF\u03b2 signalling leads to chronic fibrosis.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2018-04-19", "authors": ["PatriciaRodriguez", "YassineSassi", "LucaTroncone", "LudovicBenard", "KiyotakeIshikawa", "Ronald EGordon", "SantiagoLamas", "JorgeLaborda", "Roger JHajjar", "DjamelLebeche"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehy188"}

An additional blunt chest trauma independently contributes to mortality upon the development of an acute lung injury (ALI) by aggravating pathophysiological consequences of hemorrhagic shock. The maintenance of hydrogen sulfide availability is known to play an important role during hemorrhage and ALI. We therefore tested the impact of a genetic 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase mutation (\u03943-MST) in a resuscitated murine model of traumatic-hemorrhagic shock.\nAnesthetized wild-type (WT) and \u03943-MST mice underwent hemorrhagic shock with/without blunt chest trauma. Hemorrhagic shock was implemented for 1\u200ah followed by retransfusion of shed blood and intensive care therapy for 4\u200ah, including lung-protective mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and noradrenaline titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure at least 50 mmHg. Systemic hemodynamics, metabolism, and acid-base status were assessed together with lung mechanics and gas exchange. Postmortem tissue samples were analyzed for immunohistological protein expression and mitochondrial oxygen consumption.\n3-MST-deficient mice showed similar results in parameters of hemodynamics, gas exchange, metabolism, acid base status, and survival compared with the respective WT controls. Renal albumin extravasation was increased in \u03943-MST mice during hemorrhagic shock, together with a decrease of LEAK respiration in heart tissue. In contrast, mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the uncoupled state was increased in kidney and liver tissue of \u03943-MST mice subjected to the combined trauma.\nIn summary, in a resuscitated murine model of traumatic-hemorrhagic shock, 3-MST deficiency had no physiologically relevant impact on hemodynamics and metabolism, which ultimately lead to unchanged mortality regardless of an additional blunt chest trauma.", "journal": "Shock (Augusta, Ga.)", "date": "2018-04-19", "authors": ["MichaelGr\u00f6ger", "MartinWepler", "UlrichWachter", "TamaraMerz", "OscarMcCook", "SandraKress", "BrittaLukaschewski", "SebastianHafner", "MarkusHuber-Lang", "EnricoCalzia", "MichaelGeorgieff", "NoriyukiNagahara", "CsabaSzab\u00f3", "PeterRadermacher", "ClairHartmann"], "doi": "10.1097/SHK.0000000000001165\n10.1097/SHK.0000000000001115"}

Thereby, we hypothesized that a cardiac-specific induction of PPAR\u03b1 might restore the FAO-related protein expression and resultant energy deficit. In the present study, consequences of PPAR\u03b1 augmentation were evaluated for amelioration of chronic oxidative stress, myocyte apoptosis, and cardiac function during pathological cardiac hypertrophy.\nNanotized PPAR\u03b1 overexpression targeted to myocardium was done by a stearic acid-modified carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMC) conjugated to a 20-mer myocyte-targeted peptide (CMCP). Overexpression of PPAR\u03b1 ameliorated pathological hypertrophy and improved cardiac function. Augmented PPAR\u03b1 in hypertrophied myocytes revealed downregulated p53 acetylation (lys 382), leading to reduced apoptosis. Such cells showed increased binding of PPAR\u03b1 with p53 that in turn reduced interaction of p53 with glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which upregulated inactive phospho-GSK3\u03b2 (serine [Ser]9) expression within mitochondrial protein fraction. Altogether, the altered molecular milieu in PPAR\u03b1-overexpressed hypertrophy groups restored mitochondrial structure and function both in vitro and in vivo.\nCardiomyocyte-targeted overexpression of a protein of interest (PPAR\u03b1) by nanotized plasmid has been described for the first time in this study. Our data provide a novel insight towards regression of pathological hypertrophy by ameliorating mitochondrial oxidative stress in targeted PPAR\u03b1-overexpressed myocardium.\nPPAR\u03b1-overexpression during pathological hypertrophy showed substantial betterment of mitochondrial structure and function, along with downregulated apoptosis.

The highlighted principles are that CVD microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly expressed in heart tissue and that they play central roles in miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network. In addition, CVD-related miRNAs are close to one another in the functional network, indicating the modular characteristic features of CVD miRNAs. We believe that the regulatory principles summarized here will further contribute to our understanding of ncRNA function and dysregulation mechanisms in CVDs.", "journal": "Briefings in bioinformatics", "date": "2017-10-03", "authors": ["YongshengLi", "CaiqinHuo", "TaoPan", "LiliLi", "XiyunJin", "XiaoyuLin", "JuanChen", "JinwenZhang", "ZhengGuo", "JuanXu", "XiaLi"], "doi": "10.1093/bib/bbx095"}
{"title": "TRAF6: A player in CVB3-induced myocarditis?", "abstract": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is an important inducer of myocarditis, which, in susceptible individuals, can chronify and eventually lead to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The respective mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we analyzed expression of the TRAF6 gene, encoding TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a signal transduction scaffold protein that acts downstream of cytokine receptors, in heart tissue of susceptible and non-susceptible mouse strains. We found that after infection, TRAF6 expression was upregulated in both non-susceptible C57BL/6 wildtype and susceptible A.BY/SnJ and C57BL/6-TLR3 (-/-) mice, however, to different degrees. In infected HeLa cells, we also found moderately elevated TRAF6 levels after infection, in addition, activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), which can be activated downstream of TRAF6, was strongly enhanced in infected cells. To functionally analyze the role of TRAF6 with regard to infection progression, TRAF6 expression was knocked down in cultured HeLa cells using specific siRNAs. We found that reduction of TRAF6 expression had no effect on NF\u03baB activation in response to infection. Taken together, our data suggest that CVB3 infection enhances TRAF6 levels, however, this induction might not be necessary for infection-induced NF\u03baB activation.", "journal": "Cytokine", "date": "2017-09-10", "authors": ["Oana NUrsu", "TinaBeyer", "MartinaSauter", "AnnunziataFragasso", "SandraBundschuh", "KarinKlingel", "BarbaraMunz"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cyto.2017.08.023"}
