{"title": "Heterogeneous expression of NO-activated soluble guanylyl cyclase in mammalian heart: implications for NO- and redox-mediated indirect versus direct regulation of cardiac ion channel function.", "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides exert significant but diverse regulatory effects on cardiac myocytes. Many of these effects are due to modulation of voltage-sensitive ion channel function. The redox-status of NO-related compounds is a critical factor in determining whether indirect (cGMP-dependent) versus direct (cGMP-independent) effects are dominant. However, molecular mechanisms by which different cardiac myocyte types, and associated different ion channel types expressed within them, could achieve selectivity between NO-related indirect versus direct effects are unclear We have previously demonstrated heterogeneous expression gradients of Type III NO synthase (eNOS) and sarcolemmal superoxide dismutase (ECSOD) in ferret and human ventricle, with both enzymes being highly expressed in right ventricle and left ventricular subepicardium but markedly reduced in left ventricular subendocardium. In this study we extend this previous analysis by analyzing NO-activated soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) expression in the heart (ferret and human). We demonstrate that, at both tissue and single myocyte levels, sGC protein expression is heterogeneous, being high in sinoatrial node, right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricular subepicardium, but markedly reduced to absent in left atrium and left ventricular subendocardium. Thus, there is a significant overlap in expression gradients of sGC, eNOS, and ECSOD among distinct cardiac tissue and myocyte types. These gradients positively correlate with both: (i) experimentally measured basal NO production levels; and (ii) expression gradients of specific voltage-gated ion channels (particularly Kv1 and Kv4 channels). Our results provide the first demonstration in the heart of an expressed coupled multienzymatic system for selective regulation of indirect (sGC-dependent) versus direct (sGC-independent) NO- and redox-related modulation of voltage-gated ion channel function in different myocyte types. Our results also have functional implications for NO(*)/redox-related modulation of ion channels expressed in other cell types, including neurons, skeletal muscle and smooth muscle.", "journal": "Channels (Austin, Tex.)", "date": "2008-08-12", "authors": ["Mulugu VBrahmajothi", "Donald LCampbell"], "doi": "10.4161/chan.5189"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective activity of silymarin in ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction in albino rats.", "abstract": "There is comprehensive experimental and clinical evidence that either exogenous supplementation of natural antioxidants or augmentation of endogenous antioxidants attenuates myocardial infarction.\nTo investigate the effects of chronic administration of silymarin against ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction in rats.\nSilymarin was administered orally to Wistar albino rats (200 g to 250 g) in three different doses (100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg), by gastric gavage for one week. At the end of this period, control (ischemia-reperfusion) groups and silymarin-treated groups were subjected to 30 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and thereafter reperfused for 4 h.\nIschemia-reperfusion resulted in significant cardiac necrosis, indicated by elevated levels of serum marker enzymes such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-isoenzyme and creatine kinase. A significant rise in the end products of myocardial lipid peroxides (malondialdehydes [MDAs]), loss of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and reduced glutathione) and increased levels of myeloperoxidase in heart tissue were observed in the animals subjected to in vivo myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Infarct size was measured by using the staining agent 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. A lead II electrocardiogram was monitored at various intervals throughout the experiment.\nThe present study showed that silymarin protected the endogenous antioxidant enzymes, suppressed the neutrophil infiltration during ischemia-reperfusion and limited the infarct size, with concomitant reduction in serum MDA, tissue MDA and serum marker enzymes in rats subjected to 30 min coronary artery occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Pretreatment with silymarin also protected rat hearts from a further drop in mean arterial blood pressure during reperfusion, and restored heart rate at the end of the reperfusion period.\nThe present study suggests that the phytochemical silymarin has cardioprotective activity against ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction in rats.", "journal": "Experimental and clinical cardiology", "date": "2008-07-25", "authors": ["Pragada RajeswaraRao", "Routhu KasiViswanath"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Remodelling of cardiac gap junction connexin 43 and arrhythmogenesis.", "abstract": "In cardiac muscle, the gap junction plays a pivotal role in electrical cell-to-cell coupling and impulse propagation between cells. The function of the gap junction depends on the regulation of connexin in the gap junction channel. A dysfunction of the gap junction is possibly caused by the downregulation of connexin or one of arrhythmogenic factors. The mechanisms of ventricular fibrillation, a lethal tachyarrhythmia, have been studied in relation to the remodelling of connexin.\nTo determine what type of connexin 43 (Cx43) remodelling contributes to the generation of ventricular fibrillation and what factors induce the modelling of Cx43.\nAconitine-induced ventricular fibrillation was induced in hearts isolated from adult rats. Alterations in the electrical activity, the phosphorylation of Cx43 and the expression of Cx43 were evaluated by both intracellular and extracellular recording of the action potentials, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Flutter activity after the application of aconitine shifted spontaneously to fibrillation, showing an electrical interaction between neighbouring cells in close proximity to one another. The facility of the shift from flutter to fibrillation was evaluated as a susceptibility of the heart to fibrillation in relation to gap junction function. The effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, angiotensin II (AII) analogues, AII antagonists, the diabetic state, protein kinase A (PKA) activator, cyclic AMP analogues, d-sotalol (class III antiarrhythmic drug) and PKA inhibitors on the susceptibility of the heart to fibrillation were examined.\nPathological hearts with heterogeneous expression of Cx43 at the gap junction, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-and AII analogue-treated hearts, as well as diabetic hearts, showed a significantly higher susceptibility to fibrillation. On the other hand, hearts with augmentative expression of Cx43 at the gap junction, such as hearts pretreated with a PKA activator, a cyclic AMP analogue (8-bromo-cyclic AMP) or d-sotalol, showed a significantly lower susceptibility to fibrillation. At the beginning of fibrillation, an increase in the cardiac tissue AII level, an augmentation of the protein kinase C (PKC)-epsilon activity, the presence of PKC-mediated hyperphosphorylation, a suppression of the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43 and a reduction in the expression of Cx43 at the gap junction were observed. These alterations in Cx43 expression were also observed to increase as the fibrillation advanced.\nAugmentation of PKC-mediated phosphorylation and suppression of PKA-mediated phosphorylation induces the downward remodelling of Cx43. Such remodelling of Cx43 induces asynchronous electrical activities and makes the ventricular tissue susceptible to fibrillation. PKC is activated by AII. The fibrillation itself remodels Cx43, thereby causing a vicious cycle. As a result, PKC inhibitors, AII antagonists and PKA activators are considered to possibly have a protective effect against the initiation or advancement of ventricular fibrillation.", "journal": "Experimental and clinical cardiology", "date": "2008-07-25", "authors": ["TakashiMayama", "KenMatsumura", "HaiLin", "KoichiOgawa", "IsseiImanaga"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Biochemical studies on the cardioprotective effect of glutamine on tissue antioxidant defense system in isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction in rats.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms with a central role involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction. The protective effect of glutamine on myocardial antioxidant defense system was investigated during isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction, an animal model of myocardial infarction of human beings. Levels of diagnostic marker enzymes in plasma, reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxides and the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in heart tissue were determined. Injection of isoprenaline caused significant increases in the levels of diagnostic marker enzymes in plasma and lipid peroxidation in heart tissue. A parallel decline in the levels of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) and GSH and the activities of glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzymes and antiperoxidative enzymes in heart tissue was also observed. Prior oral administration of glutamine significantly prevented isoprenaline-induced adverse effects and maintained myocardial antioxidant status at near normal status. The cardioprotective effect of glutamine is probably related to a strengthening of the myocardial membrane by its membrane stabilizing action, or to a counteraction of free radicals by its antioxidant property, or to its ability to maintain near to normal status the activities of free radical scavenging enzymes and the level of GSH, which protect myocardial membrane against oxidative damage by decreasing lipid peroxidation.", "journal": "Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition", "date": "2008-04-26", "authors": ["SubramaniamH S Kumar", "RangasamyAnandan"], "doi": "10.3164/jcbn.40.49"}

Fourteen of these cases were diagnosed to have myocarditis based on Dallas criteria and World Heart Federation's consensus. The clinical and pathologic findings were reviewed. The cardiac conduction system was examined in details by serial sectioning in 3 cases.\nFourteen cases suffered with myocarditis, which accounted for 48% of all cases of sudden cardiac death studied. The age of the deceased ranged from 8 to 68 years (mean = 30 years), with male-to-female ratio equaled to 9:5. Lymphocytic myocarditis and neutrophil myocarditis were the two major types, affecting 11 and 3 cases, respectively. The inflammatory infiltrates were often patchy rather than diffuse. The inflammatory foci were detected only in 8% to 42% (average = 20%) of the paraffin sections of the heart tissue. These lesions were usually located in the lateral wall of left ventricle and occasionally in interventricular septum and right ventricular wall. Myocardial injury was mild in most cases while patchy myocytolysis or coagulation necrosis was observed only in a few cases. Most of the lesions were relatively new and histologic evidence of myocardial repairing sometimes coexisted. Pericarditis and subacute endocarditis were also identified in 4 and 1 cases, respectively. Atrioventricular node was involved by myocarditis in 1 of the 3 cases examined for cardiac conduction system. Two cases showed gross evidence of cardiac dilatation (either left ventricle or biventricular).

However, the role of CAR in virus-induced myocarditis has not been investigated so far. The purpose of this study was to assess myocardial CAR expression in response to cytokine-induced inflammatory reactions during the course of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. In Balb/c mice intraperitoneally infected with either 2x10(4) plaque-forming units (PFUs) of coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) or 10(2) PFUs CVB3, CAR expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a known cytokine-inducible transcription factor involved in viral defense, were determined. Our results demonstrated that within the first 7 days after virus inoculation, when the viral replication and STAT1 activation in the heart tissue was most prominent, the expression of CAR did not surpass that of uninfected controls. However, the up-regulation of CAR was observed 9 weeks later, when enteroviral RNA was no longer detectable and activation of STAT1 had already ceased. In contrast to the STAT1 target genes Mig and Irf1, interferon gamma stimulation failed to up-regulate Car expression in isolated cardiomyocytes. In human endomyocardial biopsies, Car expression was found to be elevated in approximately one third of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (9 of 30 patients) as compared with controls.

{"title": "Pathology and pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is on the rise. In India and other developing countries, rheumatic heart disease (RHD) continues to be a major public health problem and contributes to significant cardiac morbidity and mortality. RHD in the juvenile age group namely juvenile mitral stenosis is a variant which is unique to the Indian subcontinent. Severe valve deformities lead to high morbidity and mortality. Despite various measures no appreciable decline in prevalence of RHD has been documented. At autopsy, mitral valve was most commonly affected either alone or in combination with aortic and tricuspid valves. Both functional and organic involvement of tricuspid valve was documented. It has been convincingly demonstrated that molecular mimicry between Streptococcus pyogenes antigen and human proteins lead to autoimmune reactions both humoral and cell mediated causing RF/RHD. Heart tissues namely the valves, left atrial appendage (LAA) and myocardium reveal variable amounts of infiltration by lymphocytes. Significant endocarditis and valvulitis is observed in these cases. CD4+ T cells are most likely the ultimate effectors of chronic valve lesions in RHD. They can recognize Streptococcal M5 protein peptides and produce various inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-4 which could be responsible for progressive fibrotic valvular lesions. Cardiac myosin has been defined as a putative autoantigen recognized by autoantibodies of RF patients. Cross reactivity between cardiac myosin and group A beta hemolytic Streptococcal M protein has been adequately demonstrated. Cardiac myosin has been shown to produce myocarditis in rats and mice. Valvulitis/ endocarditis has been observed in excised LAA, cardiac valves and in hearts at autopsy from cases of RHD. The disease predominantly affects the valvular endocardium culminating in crippling valve deformities. Endocardial infiltrate and their migration into the valve substance has been elegantly demonstrated in rats and mice. Immune responses against cardiac myosin lead to valvular heart disease and infiltration of the heart by Streptococcal M protein reactive T lymphocytes. Mitral valves showed various degrees of calcification. An interesting observation is the nature of calcification in diseased/distorted valves in RHD. Recent studies indicate that calcification is not merely an inactive, \"dystrophic\" process but involves a regulated inflammatory process associated with expression of osteoblast markers and neoangiogenesis. Increased plasma osteopontin levels correlated with severity of mitral valve calcification. Further evidence of inflammation is supported by high levels of advanced oxidation protein products and high sensitive C-reactive protein in plasma detected in patients with RHD. Presence of inflammatory cells and increased expression of several cytokines in cases of \"end stage\" RHD reflects a possible subclinical, ongoing insult/injury to some unrecognized antigenic stimulus by beta hemolytic Streptococcal antigens that have sensitized/primed the various target tissues and which further culminate in permanent valve deformities.", "journal": "Indian journal of pathology & microbiology", "date": "2008-03-01", "authors": ["PChopra", "HanniGulwani"], "doi": null}

The cell-seeded collagen matrix seems to increase the thickness of the infarct scar with viable tissues and helps to normalize cardiac wall stress in injured regions, thus limiting ventricular remodeling and improving diastolic function.

Notably, the EB protocol resulted in more reproducible transcription profiles than the HD protocol. The results presented here provide new information about gene regulation during early differentiation of hESCs with emphasis on the cardiomyogenic program.

The cardiotoxicity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of adriamycin (ADR) at a single dose of 20 mg x kg(-1). Mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=20): normal control group, ADR 20 mg x kg(-1) group, quercetin (50, 100, and 200 mg x kg(-1) groups, intragastric administration, once a day, for 7 days before ADR administration). The health conditions, electrocardiogram, activity of iNOS, SOD and LDH, levels of NO and MDA in serum or tissue homogenate, the ultrastructure and the expression of p53 protein in cardiac tissue of mice were observed. Compared with the normal control group, ADR decreased the amplitude of ECG's R wave (P < 0.001), increased the incidence of arrhythmia (to 60%), injured myocardial ultrastructure, increased the activity of LDH and iNOS, and levels of NO and MDA, decreased the activity of SOD, and increased the expression of p53 (P < 0.001). Compared with ADR 20 mg x kg(-1) group, the quercetin decreased the levels of LDH, iNOS, NO and MDA, increased the activity of SOD, restored the amplitude of R wave, decreased the incidence of arrhythmia and p53 expression (P < 0.001 , P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), and markedly reduced the myocardial ultrastructure injury. Quercetin had protective effect against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity.

Lethality studies conducted in mice demonstrated a significant (p<0.01) protection of GSP against venom lethality. Pretreatment with GSP (200 mg kg(-1), p.o., 10 days) prior to venom injection (350 microg kg(-1), s.c.) resulted in a significant decrease in percent mortality as well as in significant prolongation of the animal's survival time (p<0.01). Monitoring the cardiovascular effects elicited by venom injection in anesthetized rats revealed a marked protection of GSP against the increase in mean arterial blood pressure evoked by LQQ venom. Moreover, pretreatment with GSP reduced the characteristic signs of conduction defects, myocardial ischemia, and infarction observed by venom injection. Biochemical analyses showed that scorpion envenomation caused significant (p<0.001) elevation in serum lactate dehydrogenase as well as creatine kinase-MB activities. Such elevation was ameliorated by GSP (p<0.001). Oxidative stress parameters revealed that scorpion venom significantly increased (p<0.001) the level of lipid peroxidative damage in cardiac tissues and reduced the activity of both glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes in cardiac tissues (p<0.05). In the meantime, GSP offered significant protection against lipid peroxidative damage (p<0.05) and enhanced cardiac glutathione reductase activity (p<0.001).

Understanding the factors regulating vulnerability to the re-entry is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to prevent ventricular fibrillation. In this study, we investigated how pre-existing tissue heterogeneities and electrical restitution properties affect the initiation of re-entry by premature extrastimuli in two-dimensional cardiac tissue models. We studied two pacing protocols for inducing re-entry following the \"sinus\" rhythm (S1) beat: (1) a single premature (S2) extrastimulus in heterogeneous tissue; (2) two premature extrastimuli (S2 and S3) in homogeneous tissue. In the first case, the vulnerable window of re-entry is determined by the spatial dimension and extent of the heterogeneity, and is also affected by electrical restitution properties and the location of the premature stimulus. The vulnerable window first increases as the action potential duration (APD) difference between the inside and outside of the heterogeneous region increases, but then decreases as this difference increases further. Steeper APD restitution reduces the vulnerable window of re-entry. In the second case, electrical restitution plays an essential role. When APD restitution is flat, no re-entry can be induced. When APD restitution is steep, re-entry can be induced by an S3 over a range of S1S2 intervals, which is also affected by conduction velocity restitution. When APD restitution is even steeper, the vulnerable window is reduced due to collision of the spiral tips.", "journal": "Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)", "date": "2008-01-01", "authors": ["Diana XTran", "Ming-JimYang", "James NWeiss", "AlanGarfinkel", "ZhilinQu"], "doi": "10.1063/1.2784387"}

Other groups have reported that permanent and temporary ligation of the coronary artery resulted in scarring without regeneration.\nTo clarify these contradictory results, we studied the temporal evolution of infarcts in MRL/MpJ and C57BL/6 control mice from 1 to 90 days post injury and the effects of intrathoracic cryoinjury to 28 days.\nAfter infarction, the conversion from necrotic myocardium to granulation tissue and then to scar proceeded identically in the two groups.

Endothelial cell and total vascular density in the both the infarcted and noninfarcted cardiac tissue did not differ between groups at any time. Histological analysis of directly cryoinjured right and left ventricular myocardium showed indistinguishable wound healing in both strains, and final scar size was identical in each group.\nThese studies demonstrate that both myocardial infarcts and cryoinjuries in MRL/MpJ mice heal by typical scar formation rather than muscle regeneration, in a manner very similar to C57BL/6 controls.

Although the molecular triggers which allow vascular ingrowth in the aforementioned avascular regions are not well understood, they may represent potential prophylactic or therapeutic targets. Thus, an investigation was conducted to determine whether the expression of chondromodulin-1 (Chm-1), an anti-angiogenic protein, is dysregulated in mitral valves in a rabbit model of IE, and whether Chm-1 transcripts are differentially expressed in various heart tissues.\nFive groups of animals (seven per group) were studied: group I was untreated controls; group II received (intravenously) 6x10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus; group III underwent mitral valve surgery; and groups IV and V underwent surgery and received S. aureus (as per group II), with tissues sampled at 6 and 12 h after surgery, respectively). Mitral valve surgery was performed by sewing a Dacron patch onto the valve, thereby creating a lesion and causing valve insufficiency. Explanted hearts were dissected and Chm-1 expression was determined using both conventional and real-time RT-PCR.\nChm-1 transcripts were found in all cardiac regions, with strong expression in the heart valves, aorta, and pulmonary artery, and lowest expression in the ventricles. Both RT-PCR methods led to similar results; however, the down-regulation of Chm-1 expression in groups III, IV and V compared to controls was more pronounced in the real-time RT-PCR experiments (89 +/- 28% versus 40 +/- 28%; 63 +/- 22% versus 29 +/- 19%; and 51 +/- 11% versus 13 +/- 7.4%; Chm-1/GAPDH ratio levels relative to the control group in conventional versus real-time RT-PCRs in groups III, IV and V, respectively). Only the decrease in group V was significantly different from group I with both methods (p < 0.05 and p = 0.001).

{"title": "Intracardiac lipid accumulation, lipoatrophy of muscle cells and expansion of myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients.", "abstract": "The overall mortality of diabetic patients after myocardial infarction is 3-4 times higher than non-diabetics. The cellular mechanisms underlying such a poor clinical prognosis remain incompletely understood. Recent reports suggest that lipotoxicity associated with impaired liporegulation is among the leading factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study was to investigate whether excess lipid accumulation specifically in heart muscle cells contributes to the expansion of myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients. Comparative structural analysis of cardiac tissue was performed on autopsy samples from the infracted hearts of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals with special reference to the expansion of the infarction, degenerative changes, lipoatrophy, cell death, and replacement fibrosis. We found that progressive accumulation of lipids in cardiac myocytes was accompanied by considerable loss of myofibrils and was frequently observed in the heart tissue of type 2 diabetic patients. This indicates that disassembly of the contractile apparatus in the cells infiltrated with lipids weakens their capability for functional activity. Analysis of degenerative changes in the diabetic tissue has shown that lipid-laden cardiac myocytes were more susceptible to necrotic and apoptotic cells death leading to expansion of the infarction and the development of progressive focal replacement fibrosis both in the perinecrotic zone and in the areas located far from the site of injury. Our data show that lipoatrophy and loss of muscle cells during the post-infarction period aggravate the functional impairment in the diabetic heart and limits its adaptive capacity for compensatory remodeling.

Here, we have investigated the effects of propiverine on cardiac ion channels and action potentials as well as on contractile properties of cardiac tissue, in order to estimate its cardiac safety profile, because other drugs used in this indication had to be withdrawn due to safety reasons. Whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record the following cardiac ion currents: rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr), I(Ks)), ultra rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kur)), inwardly rectifying K+ current I(K1), transient outward K+ current (I(to)), and L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)). Action potentials in cardiac tissue biopsies were recorded with conventional microelectrodes. The torsade de pointes screening assay (TDPScreen) was used for drug scoring. Propiverine blocked in a concentration-dependent manner HERG channels expressed in HEK293 cells, as well as native I(Kr) current in ventricular myocytes of guinea pig (IC50 values: 10 microM and 1.8 microM respectively). At high concentrations (100 microM), propiverine suppressed I(Ks). I(K1) and the transient outward current I(to) and I(Kur) were not affected. In guinea-pig ventricular and human atrial myocytes, propiverine also blocked I(Ca,L) (IC50 values: 34.7 microM and 41.7 microM, respectively) and reduced force of contraction. Despite block of I(Kr), action potential duration was not prolonged in guinea-pig and human ventricular tissue, but decreased progressively until excitation failed altogether. Similar effects were observed in dog Purkinje fibers. Propiverine obtained a low score in the TDPScreen.

Routine national labs offer testing for only 2 species, but at least 9 have been discovered as human infections within the last 15 years. Some authors discuss Bartonella cases having atypical presentations, with serious morbidity considered uncharacteristic of more routine Bartonella infections. Some atypical findings include distortion of vision, abdominal pain, severe liver and spleen tissue abnormalities, thrombocytopenic purpura, bone infection, arthritis, abscesses, heart tissue and heart valve problems. While some articles discuss Bartonella as a cause of neurologic illnesses, psychiatric illnesses have received limited attention. Case reports usually do not focus on psychiatric symptoms and typically only as incidental comorbid findings. In this article, we discuss patients exhibiting new-onset agitation, panic attacks, and treatment-resistant depression, all of which may be attributed to Bartonella.\nThree patients receiving care in an outpatient clinical setting developed acute onset personality changes and agitation, depression, and panic attacks. They were retrospectively examined for evidence of Bartonella infections. The medical and psychiatric treatment progress of each patient was tracked until both were significantly resolved and the Bartonella was cured.\nThe patients generally seemed to require higher dosing of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or antipsychotics in order to function normally. Doses were reduced following antibiotic treatment and as the presumed signs of Bartonella infection remitted. All patients improved significantly following treatment and returned to their previously healthy or near-normal baseline mental health status.\nNew Bartonella species are emerging as human infections. Most do not have antibody or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic testing at this time. Manual differential examinations are of unknown utility, due to many factors such as low numbers of infected red blood cells, the small size of the infecting bacteria, uncertainty of current techniques in viewing such small bacteria, and limited experience. As an emerging infection, it is unknown whether Bartonella occurrence in humans worldwide is rare or common, without further information from epidemiology, microbiology, pathology, and treatment outcomes research.\nThree patients presented with acute psychiatric disorders associated with Bartonella-like signs and symptoms. Each had clear exposure to ticks or fleas and presented with physical symptoms consistent with Bartonella, eg, an enlarged lymph node near an Ixodes tick bite and bacillary angiomatosis found only in Bartonella infections. Laboratory findings and the overall general course of the illnesses seemed consistent with Bartonella infection. The authors are not reporting that these patients offer certain proof of Bartonella infection, but we hope to raise the possibility that patients infected with Bartonella can have a variety of mental health symptoms.

Because alpha-synuclein is one of the key molecules in the pathogenesis of this disease, we further investigated how alpha-synuclein aggregates are involved in this distal-dominant degeneration. Both cardiac tissues and paravertebral sympathetic ganglia were obtained for comparison from 20 patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), 10 with PD, 20 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 10 control subjects. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a marker for sympathetic nerves, phosphorylated neurofilament as a marker for axons and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein for pathological deposits. We found that (i) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles, namely the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve, were much more abundant in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons than in this disease with decreased TH-ir axons and PD; (ii) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles were closely related to the disappearance of TH-ir axons; (iii) in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons, alpha-synuclein aggregates were consistently more abundant in the epicardial nerve fascicles than in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia; (iv) this distal-dominant accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates was reversed in ILBD with decreased TH-ir axons and PD, which both showed fewer of these axons but more abundant alpha-synuclein aggregates in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and (v) MSA was completely different from ILBD and PD based on the preservation of TH-ir axons and the scarcity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in either the cardiac tissues or the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. These findings indicate that accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and that heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD, which sharply contrasts with slight changes in MSA. This chronological and dynamic relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregates and distal-dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system may represent the pathological mechanism underlying a common degenerative process in PD.", "journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "date": "2007-12-15", "authors": ["SatoshiOrimo", "ToshikiUchihara", "AyakoNakamura", "FumiakiMori", "AkiyoshiKakita", "KoichiWakabayashi", "HitoshiTakahashi"], "doi": "10.1093/brain/awm302"}

However, these effects on the cardiovascular system have not yet been fully elucidated. Using mRNA expression and correlation analyses, we designed the present study to elucidate (1) translocation of chemicals in inhaled f-PM to the heart, (2) induction of oxidative stress, one of the causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), (3) mRNA expression related to CVDs, and (4) correlations among mRNA expression of various molecules and cardiovascular function. Wistar Kyoto male rats were exposed to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs, 0.6-1.5mg/m3) in Yokohama for 4 days (4.5h/day) or to filtered air for 3 days and CAPs for 1 day or to filtered air for 4 days. Messenger RNA expression and cardiovascular function were measured after the 4-day exposure. In samples of heart tissue, the mRNAs of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1, a biomarker of exposure to chemicals; heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a marker of oxidative stress; and endothelin A (ET A) receptor, a receptor of vasoconstrictors, were up-regulated by CAPs; their levels were significantly correlated with the cumulative weight of CAPs in the exposure chamber. The up-regulation of ET A receptor mRNA was significantly correlated with the increase in HO-1 mRNA and weakly with the increase in mean blood pressure (Delta MBP). These results suggest the possibility that chemicals in CAPs might be translocated to the heart, where they induce oxidative stress and activate endothelin signaling, resulting in an increase in the blood pressure. The exposure to f-PM might thus affect cardiovascular function through activation of endothelin signaling.", "journal": "Toxicology", "date": "2007-12-14", "authors": ["TsuyoshiIto", "TadaoSuzuki", "KumikoTamura", "ToyohikoNezu", "KatsuyaHonda", "TakahiroKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.tox.2007.10.013"}

{"title": "Relaxin induces mast cell inhibition and reduces ventricular arrhythmias in a swine model of acute myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "Resident cardiac mast cells, located mainly around coronary vessels and in the right atrium close to the sinoatrial node, are the main repository of cardiac histamine. Inflammatory activation of cardiac mast cells, as occurs upon acute myocardial infarction, causes the release of histamine and prostanoids. These substances lead to severe tachyarrhythmias, cardiodepressive effects and coronary spasm, thus contributing to myocardial damage and early, lethal outcome. Relaxin, known to inhibit mast cell activation, has been recently validated as a cardiotropic hormone, being produced by the heart and acting on specific heart receptors. In this study, we report on a swine model of heart ischemia/reperfusion, currently used to test cardiotropic drugs, in which human recombinant relaxin (2.5 and 5 microg/kg b.w.), given at reperfusion upon a 30-min ischemia, markedly reduced cardiac injury as compared with the vehicle-treated animals. Evidence is provided that relaxin, at both the assayed doses, causes a clear-cut, significant reduction of plasma histamine, increase in cardiac histamine content and decrease in cardiac mast cell degranulation. This is accompanied by a reduction of oxidative cardiac tissue injury (assessed as tissue malondialdehyde) and of the occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, this study provides further insight into the cardioprotective effects of relaxin, which also involve mast cell inhibition, and confirms the relevance of histamine in the pathophysiology of ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiac injury and dysfunction. It also offers additional evidence for the potential therapeutic effects of relaxin in animal models of disease involving mast cell activation.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2007-12-11", "authors": ["SilviaNistri", "LorenzoCinci", "Avio-MariaPerna", "EmanuelaMasini", "RosannaMastroianni", "DanieleBani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2007.11.001"}
{"title": "Finite element modeling of the left atrium to facilitate the design of an endoscopic atrial retractor.", "abstract": "With the worldwide prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, much attention has been focused on simulating the characteristics of the human heart to better understand and treat cardiac disorders. The purpose of this study is to build a finite element model of the left atrium (LA) that incorporates detailed anatomical features and realistic material characteristics to investigate the interaction of heart tissue and surgical instruments. This model is used to facilitate the design of an endoscopically deployable atrial retractor for use in minimally invasive, robotically assisted mitral valve repair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a pressurized explanted porcine heart were taken to provide a 3D solid model of the heart geometry, while uniaxial tensile tests of porcine left atrial tissue were conducted to obtain realistic material properties for noncontractile cardiac tissue. A finite element model of the LA was constructed using ANSYS Release 9.0 software and the MRI data. The Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material model was chosen to characterize the passive left atrial tissue; material constants were derived from tensile test data. Finite element analysis (FEA) models of a CardioVations Port Access retractor and a prototype endoscopic retractor were constructed to simulate interaction between each instrument and the LA. These contact simulations were used to compare the quality of retraction between the two instruments and to optimize the design of the prototype retractor. Model accuracy was verified by comparing simulated cardiac wall deflections to those measured by MRI. FEA simulations revealed that peak forces of approximately 2.85 N and 2.46 N were required to retract the LA using the Port Access and prototype retractors, respectively. These forces varied nonlinearly with retractor blade displacement. Dilation of the atrial walls and rigid body motion of the chamber were approximately the same for both retractors. Finite element analysis is shown to be an effective tool for analyzing instrument/tissue interactions and for designing surgical instruments.

All animals were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 animals were kept as controls. Group 3 and 4 animals received 50 mg/kg quercetin via an intragastric tube for 7 days for chronic treatment. Group 2 and 4 animals received an acute 15 mmol/L infusion for 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. The myocardial postischemic recovery was compared using hemodynamic data (peak systolic pressure, end-diastolic pressure and +dP/dtmax), coronary flow, biochemical parameters (lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB fraction, cardiac troponin I) from coronary effluent, and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, glutathione, glutathione reductase and nitrite) from heart tissue homogenates in each group.\nQuercetin has provided increased preservation in myocardial recovery in both chronic and acute treatment protocols compared to non-treated group. According to all estimated hemodynamic parameters, while the statistical difference between acute treated hearts and control hearts was significant (p<0.05); this significance was more clear in chronic treated groups (group 3 and 4) when compared to control (p<0.01). Likewise, biochemical and oxidative stress markers displayed significant differences in acute treated and chronic treated hearts when compared to control (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively).\nAs a major dietary flavonoid, due to its antioxidant and cytoprotective actions, quercetin has the capacity to protect the myocardial tissue against global ischemia and reperfusion injury.

Fructose-fed rats (FFR) showed elevated BP, cardiac hypertrophy, glucose intolerance, and increases in plasma glucose, insulin, free fatty acids (FFA), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. They also showed increased protein kinase C betaII (PKC betaII) expression and oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In plasma, decreased kallikrein enzyme activity and nitric oxide metabolites were observed, compared to control. Simultaneous treatment with CA (300 mg/Kg) mitigated these alterations. PKC betaII expression was similar to that of control; the rats displayed normal BP and ACE activity, enhanced antioxidant protection, and close to normal values of metabolic parameters. The BP-lowering effect of CA was abolished when CA-treated rats were administered L-nitroarginyl methyl ester (L-NAME 6g/Kg).

We review here the hypothesis that the acute and chronic adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy can be reduced by molecular replacement of membrane lipids and enzymatic cofactors, such as coenzyme Q(10). By administering nutritional supplements with replacement molecules and antioxidants, oxidative membrane damage and reductions of cofactors in normal tissues can be reversed, protecting and restoring mitochondrial and other cellular functions and reducing chemotherapy adverse effects. Recent clinical trials using cancer and non-cancer patients with chronic fatigue have shown the benefit of molecular replacement plus antioxidants in reducing the damage to mitochondrial membranes, restoring mitochondrial electron transport function, reducing fatigue and protecting cellular structures and enzymes from oxidative damage.

Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) are two endogenous ligands that activate adrenoceptor (AR) signals in a variety of physiological stress responses in animals. Here we use cardiomyocyte contraction rate response to analyze the endogenous beta(2)AR signaling induced by Epi or NE in cardiac tissue. The Epi-activated beta(2)AR induced a rapid contraction rate increase that peaked at 4 min after stimulation. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)AR induced a much slower contraction rate increase that peaked at 10 min after stimulation. Whereas both drugs activated beta(2)AR coupling to G(s) proteins, only Epi-activated receptors were capable of coupling to G(i) proteins. Subsequent studies showed that the Epi-activated beta(2)AR underwent a rapid phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and subsequent dephosphorylation on serine residues 355 and 356, which was critical for sufficient receptor recycling and G(i) coupling. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)ARs underwent slow GRK2 phosphorylation, receptor internalization and recycling, and failed to couple to G(i). Moreover, inhibiting beta(2)AR phosphorylation by betaARK C terminus or dephosphorylation by okadaic acid prevented sufficient recycling and G(i) coupling. Together, our data revealed that distinct temporal phosphorylation of beta(2)AR on serine 355 and 356 by GRK2 plays a critical role for dictating receptor cellular events and signaling properties induced by Epi or NE in cardiomyocytes.

Mice were immunized with Cz adjuvantized by alum (Cz+alum), oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (Cz+ODN-CpG) or Freund's preparation (Cz+CFA). Cz triggered a vigorous specific humoral response, irrespective of the adjuvant used. Alum mainly drove response towards Th2 phenotype, characterized by specific IgG1 antibodies and IL-10 induction, whereas Cz+ODN-CpG mice exhibited Th1-dominant immunity, with antibodies of the IgG2a isotype and enhanced IFN-gamma production. Histological examination of cardiac tissue demonstrated lesions in Cz+CFA but not in Cz+alum nor Cz+ODN-CpG immunized animals, suggesting that CFA is critical for Cz-mediated injury. Analysis of skeletal muscle revealed that mice receiving Cz+CFA exhibited disrupted and hyalinized myofibers, whereas [Cz+alum]-immunized animals showed hyalinization, architecture modifications and small inflammatory foci. Conversely, no abnormalities were observed in the striated muscle from the Cz+ODN-CpG group.

Endemic Chagas disease became established as a zoonosis over the last 200-300 years through forest clearance for agriculture and livestock rearing and adaptation of triatomines to domestic environments and to man and domestic animals as a food source. It is estimated that 15 to 16 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Latin America and 75 to 90 million people are exposed to infection. When T. cruzi is transmitted to man through the feces of triatomines, at bite sites or in mucosa, through blood transfusion or orally through contaminated food, it invades the bloodstream and lymphatic system and becomes established in the muscle and cardiac tissue, the digestive system and phagocytic cells. This causes inflammatory lesions and immune responses, particularly mediated by CD4+, CD8+, interleukin-2 (IL) and IL-4, with cell and neuron destruction and fibrosis, and leads to blockage of the cardiac conduction system, arrhythmia, cardiac insufficiency, aperistalsis, and dilatation of hollow viscera, particularly the esophagus and colon. T. cruzi may also be transmitted from mother to child across the placenta and through the birth canal, thus causing abortion, prematurity, and organic lesions in the fetus. In immunosuppressed individuals, T. cruzi infection may become reactivated such that it spreads as a severe disease causing diffuse myocarditis and lesions of the central nervous system. Chagas disease is characterized by an acute phase with or without symptoms, and with entry point signs (inoculation chagoma or Roma\u00f1a's sign), fever, adenomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and evident parasitemia, and an indeterminate chronic phase (asymptomatic, with normal results from electrocardiogram and x-ray of the heart, esophagus, and colon) or with a cardiac, digestive or cardiac-digestive form.

Accordingly, this study was carried out to explore the hypothesis that hypoxia potentiates a profibrosing phenotype of the fetal cardiac fibroblast.\nEvidence of an effect of hypoxia was sought by immunohistologic evaluation of CHB-affected fetal heart tissue and by determination of erythropoietin levels in cord blood. The in vitro effect of hypoxia on gene expression and phenotype in fibroblasts derived from fetal hearts and lungs was investigated by Affymetrix arrays, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting.\nIn vivo hypoxic exposure was supported by the prominent intracellular fibroblast expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha in conduction tissue from 2 fetuses in whom CHB led to death. The possibility that hypoxia was sustained was suggested by significantly elevated erythropoietin levels in cord blood from CHB-affected, as compared with unaffected, anti-SSA/Ro-exposed neonates. In vitro exposure of cardiac fibroblasts to hypoxia resulted in transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts (a scarring phenotype), as demonstrated on immunoblots and immunofluorescence by increased expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA), an effect not seen in lung fibroblasts. Hypoxia-exposed cardiac fibroblasts expressed adrenomedullin at 4-fold increased levels, as determined by Affymetrix array, quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence, thus focusing attention on cAMP as a modulator of fibrosis. MDL12,330A, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor that lowers the levels of cAMP, increased expression of fibrosis-related proteins (mammalian target of rapamycin, SMA, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and type I collagen), while the cAMP activator forskolin attenuated transforming growth factor beta-elicited fibrosing end points in the cardiac fibroblasts.\nThese findings provide evidence that hypoxia may amplify the injurious effects of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Modulation of cAMP may be a key component in the scarring phenotype.

{"title": "The Friedreich ataxia GAA repeat expansion mutation induces comparable epigenetic changes in human and transgenic mouse brain and heart tissues.", "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene, leading to reduced expression of frataxin protein. Evidence suggests that the mutation may induce epigenetic changes and heterochromatin formation, thereby impeding gene transcription. In particular, studies using FRDA patient blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines have detected increased DNA methylation of specific CpG sites upstream of the GAA repeat and histone modifications in regions flanking the GAA repeat. In this report we show that such epigenetic changes are also present in FRDA patient brain, cerebellum and heart tissues, the primary affected systems of the disorder. Bisulfite sequence analysis of the FXN flanking GAA regions reveals a shift in the FRDA DNA methylation profile, with upstream CpG sites becoming consistently hypermethylated and downstream CpG sites becoming consistently hypomethylated. We also identify differential DNA methylation at three specific CpG sites within the FXN promoter and one CpG site within exon 1. Furthermore, we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that there is overall decreased histone H3K9 acetylation together with increased H3K9 methylation of FRDA brain tissue. Further studies of brain, cerebellum and heart tissues from our GAA repeat expansion-containing FRDA YAC transgenic mice reveal comparable epigenetic changes to those detected in FRDA patient tissue. We have thus developed a mouse model that will be a valuable resource for future therapeutic studies targeting epigenetic modifications of the FXN gene to increase frataxin expression.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2007-11-30", "authors": ["SaharAl-Mahdawi", "Ricardo MouroPinto", "OzamaIsmail", "DhavalVarshney", "StefaniaLymperi", "ChiranjeeviSandi", "DaniahTrabzuni", "MarkPook"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddm346"}

The aim of this study was to investigate dexrazoxane and amifostine impact on the evolution of myocardial changes induced by doxorubicin. BalbC female mice were treated with doxorubicin only (10 mg/kg, single intravenous push), or with dexrazoxane (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [ip]) or amifostine (200 mg/kg, ip) 60 mins or 30 mins prior to treatment with doxorubicin, respectively. Blood sampling for determination of conventional serum-marker activity was performed 48 hrs later. The grade of histopathology changes was evaluated by light microscopy 1.5 and 3 months after treatments using the Billingham scoring method. Control groups consisted of nontreated mice. After doxorubicin-only treatment, the grade of heart tissue damage was found to increase in the period between 1.5 and 3 months. A similar but less intense progression was also detected in amifostine-pretreated animals, with significant difference among median Billingham scores between the two time points. The pretreatment with dexrazoxane suspended expansion of tissue lesions in time. Changes in serum enzyme activity revealed two correlations: the greater reduction in alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH) leakage is associated with a lower percentage of damaged tissue, and the creatine kinase to alpha-HBDH percent of difference ratio being greater than one is correlated with limited spreading of pathological lesions. Our results indicate that the development of doxorubicin-induced heart failure is based on a slow and persistent expansion of pathological process even long after the completion of the treatment.

Although in vitro transcriptional responses of macrophages to either spore or anthrax toxins have been previously reported, little is known regarding the impact of infection on gene expression in host tissues. We infected Swiss-Webster mice intranasally with 5 LD(50) of B. anthracis-virulent Ames spores and observed the global transcriptional profiles of various tissues over a 48 h time period. RNA was extracted from spleen, lung, and heart tissues of infected and control mice and examined by Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Approximately 580 host genes were significantly over or under expressed among the lung, spleen, and heart tissues at 8 and 48 h time points. Expression of genes encoding for surfactant and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation was diminished during the early phase of infection in lungs. By 48 h, a significant number of genes were modulated in the heart, including up-regulation of calcium-binding-related gene expression, and down-regulation of multiple genes related to cell adhesion, formation of the extracellular matrix, and the cell cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the spleen 8h post-infection showed striking increases in the expression of genes that encode hydrolytic enzymes, and these levels remained elevated throughout infection. Further, genes involving antigen presentation and interferon responses were down-regulated in the spleen at 8 h. In late stages of infection, splenic genes related to the inflammatory response were up-regulated. This study is the first to describe the in vivo global transcriptional response of multiple organs during inhalational anthrax. Although numerous genes related to the host immunological response and certain protection mechanisms were up-regulated in these organs, a vast list of genes important for fully developing and maintaining this response were decreased.

We derived and tested an algorithm, Voxel-Based Bosselation (VBB), for noninvasive quantification of roughness of calcific deposits in human coronary arteries imaged by computed tomography (CT).\nVBB was tested on 213 coronary calcific deposits from electron beam CT scans of 27 patients.

The algorithm was calibrated with artificially generated phantoms as well as background noise mimicking calcific deposits and surrounding heart tissue. The VBB algorithm is applicable to calcific deposits of all scales and gradations. The VBB values of the deposits in this study did not correlate with deposit size further supporting its validity as a measurement of roughness. The VBB index corresponded directly with visual reconstruction using Phong-shaded algorithms.\nThe VBB index, derived here, is a noninvasive method of quantifying the roughness of calcific deposits in CT scan data which can now be used in future clinical studies to determine possible correlations with increased plaque vulnerability and major acute coronary events.", "journal": "Investigative radiology", "date": "2007-11-22", "authors": ["Wayne TWilner", "Reza MMazraeshahi", "IbrahimAboshady", "Bernhard GBodmann", "ManosPapadakis", "DonaldKouri", "Jodie LConyers", "PaulCherukuri", "DeborahVela", "GregoryGladish", "LilachGavish", "Dianna DCody", "LorraineFrazier", "SerhiyLukovenkov", "MohammadMadjid", "AlirezaZarrabi", "AmanyAhmed", "James TWillerson", "S WardCasscells", "S DavidGertz"], "doi": "10.1097/RLI.0b013e3180cc2041"}

To understand the mechanisms of CARK gene expression and regulation, we first cloned the full-length mRNA sequence and mapped the transcription start site of the mouse CARK gene and characterized its promoter regions. Two transcriptional isoforms of the CARK gene were identified in mouse heart tissue. Truncation analysis of the CARK promoter identified a minimal 151 bp region that has strong basal transcription activity. Mutational analysis revealed five conserved cis-acting elements in this 151-bp long minimal promoter. Mutational and loss-of-functional analysis and co-transfection studies indicated that MEF2 binding region is the most critical cis-acting element in the CARK promoter, and CARK transcription level can be down-regulated by MEF2C antisense. Binding to the MEF2 sites by Mef2c protein was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays.", "journal": "Journal of cellular and molecular medicine", "date": "2007-11-21", "authors": ["HuWang", "ChenChen", "XiaodongSong", "JingzhouChen", "YisongZhen", "KaiSun", "RutaiHui"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00155.x"}
{"title": "Hydrodynamics- and ultrasound-based transfection of heart with naked plasmid DNA.", "abstract": "A novel, efficient transfection method, based on ultrasound and hydrodynamics, has been developed to transfect heart tissue with plasmid DNA. An ultrasound probe was aimed at the heart of anesthetized rats for 30 sec, at an intensity of 1 MHz and 2 W/cm2. The aorta was clamped and a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing pSV-LacZ was quickly injected into the left ventricle. Each animal was maintained in this condition for 20 sec, and then the clamp was opened and the needle was removed. Electrocardiography, performed after 4 weeks, showed mild or no sign of ischemia in all groups. Visual evaluation of heart tissue samples from rats that received 100 microg of pSV-LacZ in 100 microl had only a few blue cells, indicating transfection, and those that received only PBS had no blue cells. However, all heart tissue samples from rats transfected with 100 to 500 microg of pSV-LacZ in 200 microl, or with 200 to 500 microg of pSV-LacZ in 100 micro had many blue cells. The base and epicardium of the heart tissue samples had many more blue cells than did the rest of the samples. Histological results, based on staining with hematoxylin and eosin, showed similar results between control and transfected groups. Therefore, we concluded that gene delivery by plasmid vector in association with ultrasound and hydrodynamics was highly effective in transfecting rat heart.", "journal": "Human gene therapy", "date": "2007-11-21", "authors": ["LeonardoPinto de Carvalho", "DanielaTakeshita", "Bruno ACarillo", "Bianca CristinaGarcia Lisb\u00f4a", "GustavoMolina", "AbramBeutel", "Eduardo GallattiYasumura", "Christina MaedaTakiya", "Valderez BastosValero", "RuyRibeiro de Campos", "Hans FernandoDohmann", "Sang WonHan"], "doi": "10.1089/hum.2007.063"}

It is a major cause of heart failure and heart transplantation. DCM is of genetic origin in approximately 30% of cases and genetically heterogeneous with the identification of numerous disease genes. However, many new disease genes remain to be discovered. Focusing on gene products located in the sarcomere of cardiomyocytes as disease-causing candidates, we screened the gene encoding the sarcomeric Z-band protein myopalladin (MYPN, OMIM 608517) for mutation.\nWe sequenced the coding region in 114 (65 familial and 49 sporadic cases) independent DCM patients' DNA and functionally analysed the identified mutations. We identified four independent heterozygous mutations in two families (R1088H and I83fsX105) and two sporadic cases (V1195M, P1112L). For the three missense mutations, the substituted amino acids were conserved among species. All mutations were absent from 400 control subjects. Specific immunolabelling of heart tissue from a proband carrying the R1088H mutation showed a decreased localization of myopalladin at the Z-band area of left ventricular cardiac myofibrils. Analysis of the effects of the mutations after transfection in rat neonate cardiomyocytes indicated sarcomere disorganization and premature cell death associated with the V1195M and P1112L myopalladin expression. Allele-specific expression analysis of mRNA from a patient harbouring the I83fsX105 mutation indicated the absence of the mutated transcript, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism.\nBased on genetic, histological, and functional evidence, we identified a new gene associated with DCM and observed mutations in 3-4% of cases in a population of European descent.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2007-11-17", "authors": ["La\u00ebtitiaDuboscq-Bidot", "PengXu", "PhilippeCharron", "NathalieNeyroud", "GillesDilanian", "AlainMillaire", "Val\u00e9riaBors", "MichelKomajda", "EricVillard"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvm015"}
{"title": "Cell sheet engineering for heart tissue repair.", "abstract": "Recently, myocardial tissue engineering has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for patients suffering from severe heart failure. Nevertheless, conventional methods in tissue engineering involving the seeding of cells into biodegradable scaffolds have intrinsic shortcomings, such as inflammatory reactions and fibrous tissue formation caused by scaffold degradation. On the other hand, we have developed cell sheet engineering as scaffoldless tissue engineering, and applied it for myocardial tissue engineering. Using temperature-responsive culture surfaces, cells can be harvested as intact sheets and cell-dense thick tissues are constructed by layering these cell sheets. Myocardial cell sheets non-invasively harvested from temperature-responsive culture surfaces are successfully layered, resulting in electrically communicative 3-dimensional (3-D) cardiac constructs. Transplantation of cell sheets onto damaged hearts improved heart function in several animal models.

This study was designed to examine if overexpression of TGFbeta(1) using adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) protects cardiomyocytes from reoxygenation injury. TGFbeta(1) was overexpressed in cultured HL-1 mouse cardiomyocytes by transfection with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(Latent) or with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) (active TGFbeta(1)). TGFbeta(1) upregulation reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis induced by 24 h of hypoxia followed by 3 h of reoxygenation concomitant with reduction in reactive oxygen species release, activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and NF-kappaB expression. Transfection with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) was superior to that with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(Latent). To determine if AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) upregulation in vivo would induce cardioprotection from I-R injury, rat hearts were injected with AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Six weeks later, TGFbeta(1)(ACT) was upregulated throughout the myocardium. Following I-R, AAV/TGFbeta(1)(ACT)-overexpressing rats had much smaller infarct size (P<0.01 vs PBS group), which was also related to reduced activation of NADPH oxidase and NF-kappaB, and lower levels of malondialdehyde in I-R tissues. These data demonstrate that overexpression of TGFbeta(1) by AAV can protect cardiac tissues from reperfusion injury, possibly via antioxidant mechanism. These findings suggest potential of TGFbeta(1)(ACT) gene therapy for cardioprotection from I-R injury.", "journal": "Gene therapy", "date": "2007-11-16", "authors": ["ADandapat", "C PHu", "DLi", "YLiu", "HChen", "P LHermonat", "J LMehta"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.gt.3303071"}
{"title": "Action potential alternans in LQT3 syndrome: a simulation study.", "abstract": "The long QT syndrome type-3 (LQT3) is an inherited cardiac disorder caused by mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. LQT3 has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, specially at low heart rates. Based on computer simulations and experimental investigations, analysis of the morphology of the Action Potential (AP) has shown that it undergoes early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and spontaneous discharges, which are thought to be the trigger for reentry like-activity. However, dynamic characteristics of cardiac tissue are also important factors of arrhythmia mechanisms. In this work, we propose a dynamical analysis of the LQT3 at cellular level. We use a detailed Markovian model of the DeltaKPQ mutation, which is associated with LQT3, and we study beat-to-beat AP Duration (APD) variations by using a long-term stimulation protocol. Compared to wild-type (WT) cells, DeltaKPQ mutant cells are found to develop APD alternans over a narrow range of stimulation frequencies. Moreover, the interval of frequency dependence of APD alternans is related to the degree of severity of the EADs present in the AP. In conclusion, dynamical analysis of paced cells is a useful approach to understand the mechanisms of rate dependent arrhythmias.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

These equations are covariant under general spatial coordinate transformations and describe the motion of a stringlike object in a curved space whose metric tensor is the inverse diffusion tensor.

Induction of rats with ISO (85 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) for 2 days resulted in a significant decrease in the activities of heart mitochondrial enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) and respiratory chain enzymes (NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase). The activities of lysosomal enzymes (alpha-d-glucuronidase, alpha-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase, cathepsin-D, acid phosphatases and alpha-d-galactosidase) were increased significantly in the heart and serum of ISO-induced rats. The prior administration of GSP for 6 days a week for 5 weeks significantly increased the activities of mitochondrial and respiratory chain enzymes and significantly decreased the activities of lysosomal enzymes in the heart tissues of ISO-induced rats, which proves the stress stabilizing action of GSP. Oral administration of grape seed proanthocyanidins alone (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg) to normal rats did not show any significant effect in all the parameters studied. These biochemical functional alterations were supported by the macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of ischemic myocardium.

Increased expression of Bax, mTOR, pS6K, pErk, and 4E-BP1 was found in all CR samples. Hamartin and tuberin expression was decreased in tumors versus normal heart tissues.

After adaptation to hypoxia, the rats were subjected to 6h-immobilization stress.

A disbalance in antioxidative defense system was determined by the decrease in glutatione peroxidase, G-6-PDH activities, and GSH content. The support of glutathione reductase activity under stress in this group with simultaneous decrease of enzyme activity in the pentose phosphate pathway was realized through the participation of NADP-IDH.

Therefore, we compared gene expression in models of estrogen depletion and estrogen replacement. Using gene expression array analysis, we examined differences in expression in cardiac tissue from ovariectomized (OVX), ovariectomized with 17beta-estradiol replacement (OVX/E2), and intact rats undergoing sham procedures (Sham). We found that OVX results in at least twofold changes in expression of genes involved in inflammation, vascular tone, apoptosis, and proteolysis compared with OVX/E2. With confirmation via real-time PCR, we found an OVX-induced increase in genes mediating inflammation (inhibin betaa, IL-6, TNF-alpha, SOCS2, SOCS3), an OVX-related decrease in the myocardial mRNA expression of genes involved in regulating vasodilation (endothelial NOS, soluble guanyl cyclase), an OVX-associated increase in extracellular matrix genes (collagen12alpha1, connexin 43), and an OVX-related increase in proapoptotic genes (caspase 3, calpain). Because details of cardiac signaling by SOCS genes are virtually unknown, we examined the protein expression for these genes via Western analyses. Although we observed OVX-related increases in SOCS2 and SOCS3 mRNA, SOCS2 and SOCS3 protein did not differ among groups. In light of these findings, investigation into the net effect of OVX on inflammation is warranted.

The mechanisms resulting in this phenotype remain unclear. We hypothesized that uncoupling promotes regional ion channel remodeling, thereby increasing electrical heterogeneity and facilitating the development of PVT. In isolated-perfused control hearts, programmed electrical stimulation elicited infrequent monomorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (MVT), and dominant frequencies (DFs) during MVT were similar in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Moreover, conduction properties, action potential durations (APDs), and repolarizing current densities were similar in RV and LV myocytes. In contrast, PVT was common in Cx43 conditional knockout (OCKO) hearts, and arrhythmias were characterized by significantly higher DFs in the RV compared to the LV. APDs in OCKO myocytes were significantly shorter than those from chamber-matched controls, with RV OCKO myocytes being most affected. APD shortening was associated with higher levels of sustained current in myocytes from both chambers as well as higher levels of the inward rectifier current only in RV myocytes. Thus, alterations in cell-cell coupling lead to regional changes in potassium current expression, which in this case facilitates the development of reentrant arrhythmias. We propose a new mechanistic link between electrical uncoupling and ion channel remodeling.

Here we describe the validation of a method that combines the ability to screen tens of compounds a day, with direct assessment of channel function.\nThe electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of hNav1.5 were compared using two methods: conventional, low-throughput electrophysiology and planar-array-based, medium-throughput electrophysiology (IonWorks HT). A pharmacological comparison was also made between IonWorks HT and canine cardiac Purkinje Fibre action potential upstroke data.\nActivation curve parameters for hNav1.5 in IonWorks HT were not statistically different (p>0.05) from those generated using conventional electrophysiology. IonWorks HT V(1/2)=-22+/-0.8 mV, slope=6.9+/-0.2 (n=11); conventional electrophysiology V(1/2)=-20+/-1.6 mV, slope=6.4+/-0.3 (n=11). Potency values for a range of hNav1.5 blockers determined using IonWorks HT correlated closely with those obtained using conventional electrophysiology (R=0.967, p<0.001). The assay was able to distinguish between highly use-dependent blockers (e.g. tetracaine) and blockers that do not display strong use-dependence (e.g. quinidine). Comparison of the degree of hNav1.5 inhibition and decrease in canine Purkinje fibre action potential upstroke velocity (V(max)) showed that the IonWorks HT assay would have predicted the outcome in Purkinje fibres in the majority of cases, with false negative and positive rates estimated at 8 and 7%, respectively. Finally, hNav1.5 pharmacology was similar when determined using either IonWorks HT or IonWorks Quattro, although the latter yielded more consistent data.\nThe assay described combines a functional assessment of hNav1.5 with medium-throughput. Furthermore the assay was able to reveal information on the use-dependency of compound block, as well as predicting Na(+) channel effects in more integrated systems such as the cardiac Purkinje fibre action potential.

Detailed histological analysis and sequential echocardiography were used to determine the structural and functional consequences of cell grafting.\nTransplantation of undifferentiated hESCs resulted in the formation of teratoma-like structures. This phenomenon was prevented by grafting of ex vivo pre-differentiated hESC-CMs. The grafted cardiomyocytes survived, proliferated, matured, aligned, and formed gap junctions with host cardiac tissue. Functionally, animals injected with saline or nonmyocyte hESC derivatives demonstrated significant left ventricular (LV) dilatation and functional deterioration, whereas grafting of hESC-CMs attenuated this remodeling process. Hence, post-injury baseline fractional shortening deteriorated by 50% (from 20 +/- 2% to 10 +/- 2%) and by 30% (20 +/- 2% to 14 +/- 2%) in the saline and nonmyocyte groups while improving by 22% (21 +/- 2% to 25 +/- 3%) in the hESC-CM group. Similarly, wall motion score index and LV diastolic dimensions were significantly lower in the hESC-CM animals.\nTransplantation of hESC-CMs after extensive myocardial infarction in rats results in the formation of stable cardiomyocyte grafts, attenuation of the remodeling process, and functional benefit.

Transglutaminase (TGase) and clotting protein (CP) are molecules involved in the blood clotting system of shrimp. Here, we demonstrate in vivo the functional involvement of TGase and CP in the shrimp blood coagulation system using RNA interference. Expression of TGase mRNA was inhibited in gills, heart, hemocyte, hepatopancreas, intestine and lymphoid organ while the CP gene was suppressed only in gills and heart tissues on day-1 post-injection with 1 microg and 10 microg of TGase- and CP-dsRNA, respectively. However, at day-7 post-injection, systemic gene silencing was observed for both genes and dosages as shown by mRNA expression. We also show the efficiency of dsRNA silencing the protein expression as well as inhibited blood coagulation. Such silencing at the transcription, translation and phenotypic level is the first to be documented in the shrimp system.

In the present study, we used an in vivo mouse model to explore whether A. sinensis could protect against doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiotoxicity. Male ICR mice were treated with distilled water or water extraction of A. sinensis (15 g/kg, orally) daily for 4 weeks, followed by saline or doxorubicin (15 mg/kg, intravenously) treatments weekly. Cardiotoxicity was assessed by electrocardiograph, antioxidant activity in cardiac tissues, serum levels of creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and histopathological change in cardiac tissues. A cumulative dose of doxorubicin (60 mg/kg) caused animal death and myocardial injury characterized by increased QT interval and decreased heart rate in electrocardiograph, decrease of heart antioxidant activity, increase of serum AST, as well as myocardial lesions. Pre-treatment with A. sinensis significantly reduced mortality and improved heart performance of the doxorubicin-treated mice as evidenced from normalization of antioxidative activity and serum AST, preventing loss of myofibrils as well as improving arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxic study showed that A. sinensis did not compromise the antitumour activity of doxorubicin.

Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in heart perfusates were significantly reduced during reperfusion. These effects were accompanied by substantial release of reduced glutathione (GSH), indicating that the H(2)S moiety may have up-regulated cysteine transport.

Experimentally, it has been a challenge to produce local heterogeneity in a manner that is both reversible and well controlled. Consequently, we developed a dual-zone superfusion chamber that can dynamically create a small (5 mm) central island of heterogeneity in cultured cardiac cell monolayers. Three different conditions were studied to explore the effect of regionally slowed conduction on wave propagation and reentry: depolarization by elevated extracellular potassium, sodium channel inhibition with lidocaine, and cell-cell decoupling with palmitoleic acid. Using optical mapping of transmembrane voltage, we found that the central region of slowed conduction always served as the core region around which a spiral wave formed and then revolved following a period of rapid pacing. Because of the localized slowing in the core region, we observed experimentally for the first time an S shape of the spiral wave front near its tip.

The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate tissue-specific effects of different ion channel blockers or activators on the action potential (AP), which can affect other parameters in addition to drug-induced APD/QT prolongation or shortening.\nElectrophysiological effects were measured in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, papillary muscles and ventricular trabeculae using a microelectrode technique under the following conditions: block of I(to) with 4-AP (1 x 10(-3) M), block of Ca(2+) channels with diltiazem (1 x 10(-5) M), block of Na(+) channels with flecainide (1 x 10(-5) M), activation of Ca(2+) current with Bay-K-8644 (1 x 10(-5) M), activation of K(ATP) channels with levcromakalim (1 x 10(-5) M) or block of I(K1) current with BaCl(2) (n=8 to 12 for each group). 4-AP prolonged APD significantly more in the Purkinje fiber than in the papillary muscle or the ventricular trabecula. 4-AP elicited 63% incidence of early afterdepolarizations but 0% in the papillary or trabeculae. Diltiazem and flecainide shortened APD(40) and APD(50) and increased triangulation more in the Purkinje fiber, whilst having little effect on these parameters in the papillary muscle or the ventricular trabecula.

Optical mapping experiments were conducted in four species (mouse, rat, guinea pig, and pig). Hearts were Langendorff perfused using Tyrode's solution and blood (pig). Dyes were loaded via bolus injection into perfusate. Transillumination experiments were conducted in isolated coronary-perfused pig right ventricular wall preparations.\nThe optimal excitation wavelength in cardiac tissues (650 nm) was >70 nm beyond the absorption maximum of hemoglobin. Voltage sensitivity of both dyes was approximately 10% to 20%. Signal decay half-life due to dye internalization was 80 to 210 minutes, which is 5 to 7 times slower than for di-4-ANEPPS. In transillumination mode, DeltaF/F was as high as 20%.

{"title": "Microvascular transport model predicts oxygenation changes in the infarcted heart after treatment.", "abstract": "Chronic heart failure is most commonly due to ischemic cardiomyopathy after a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Rebuilding lost myocardium to prevent heart failure mandates a neovasculature able to nourish new cardiomyocytes. Previously we have used a series of novel techniques to directly measure the ability of the scar neovasculature to deliver and exchange oxygen at 1-4 wk after MI in rats following left coronary artery ligation. In this study, we have developed a morphologically realistic mathematical model of oxygen transport in cardiac tissue to help in deciding what angiogenic strategies should be used to rebuild the vasculature. The model utilizes microvascular morphology of cardiac tissue based on available morphometric images and is used to simulate experimentally measured oxygen levels after MI. Model simulations of relative oxygenation match experimental measurements closely and can be used to simulate distributions of oxygen concentration in normal and infarcted rat hearts. Our findings indicate that both vascular density and vascular spatial distribution play important roles in cardiac tissue oxygenation after MI. Furthermore, the model can simulate relative changes in tissue oxygen levels in infarcted tissue treated with proangiogenic compounds such as losartan. From the minimum oxygen concentration myocytes need to maintain their normal function, we estimate that 2 wk after MI 29% of the myocardium is severely hypoxic and that the vascular density of the infarcted tissue should reach 75% of normal tissue to ensure that no areas of the myocardium are critically hypoxic.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Laminar arrangement of ventricular myocytes influences electrical behavior of the heart.", "abstract": "The response of the heart to electrical shock, electrical propagation in sinus rhythm, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of ventricular fibrillation all depend critically on the electrical anisotropy of cardiac tissue. A long-held view of cardiac electrical anisotropy is that electrical conductivity is greatest along the myocyte axis allowing most rapid propagation of electrical activation in this direction, and that conductivity is isotropic transverse to the myocyte axis supporting a slower uniform spread of activation in this plane. In this context, knowledge of conductivity in two directions, parallel and transverse to the myofiber axis, is sufficient to characterize the electrical action of the heart. Here we present new experimental data that challenge this view. We have used a novel combination of intramural electrical mapping, and experiment-specific computer modeling, to demonstrate that left ventricular myocardium has unique bulk conductivities associated with three microstructurally-defined axes. We show that voltage fields induced by intramural current injection are influenced by not only myofiber direction, but also the transmural arrangement of muscle layers or myolaminae. Computer models of these experiments, in which measured 3D tissue structure was reconstructed in-silico, best matched recorded voltages with conductivities in the myofiber direction, and parallel and normal to myolaminae, set in the ratio 4:2:1, respectively. These findings redefine cardiac tissue as an electrically orthotropic substrate and enhance our understanding of how external shocks may act to successfully reset the fibrillating heart into a uniform electrical state. More generally, the mechanisms governing the destabilization of coordinated electrical propagation into ventricular arrhythmia need to be evaluated in the light of this discovery.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2007-10-20", "authors": ["Darren AHooks", "Mark LTrew", "Bryan JCaldwell", "Gregory BSands", "Ian JLeGrice", "Bruce HSmaill"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.161075"}

The aim of this study was to investigate whether cEPC and circulating mononuclear cells (MNC), which include a small number of in vivo circulating EPC, are able to transmigrate through the endothelial barrier into the cardiac tissue. MNC and EPC were isolated from the peripheral blood from healthy male volunteers (n = 13, 25+/-6 years) and stained with a fluorescent marker. The cells were perfused in vitro through organs with endothelial layers of different phenotypes (rat aorta, human umbilical vein, isolated mouse heart). The endothelium and the basal lamina were then stained by immunofluorescence and the cryo-sections analysed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. After perfusion through the rat aorta, an adhesion/integration of MNC was observed at the endothelial layer and the basal lamina beneath endothelial cells. However, no migration of MNC over the endothelial barrier was found. This remained true even when the cell numbers were increased (from 0.5 to 10 million cells/h), when the time of perfusion was prolonged (1.5-4 h) and when the aorta was cultivated for 24 h. In the Langendorff-perfused mouse heart with intact endothelium, no migration of MNC (1 x 10(7)) or cEPC (1 x 10(6)) was observed after 0.5 and 2 h.

Cultured human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) and human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HACF) isolated from human myocardial tissue constitutively express M-CSF. When HACM and HACF were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) M-CSF protein production and M-CSF mRNA expression, determined by ELISA or by using RT-PCR, respectively, was significantly increased. To determine a possible role of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activating protein 1 (AP-1) in M-CSF regulation, blockers to both pathways and an adenovirus overexpressing a dominant negative (dn) form of IkappaB kinase 2 (IKK2) were used. Only the NF-kappaB blocker dimethylfumarate and the dn IKK2, but not januskinase inhibitor-1 (JNK-I), were able to block the TNF-alpha-induced increase in M-CSF production in these cells, suggesting that the induction of M-CSF through TNF-alpha is mainly dependent on the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway.

{"title": "The role of cardiac tissue alignment in modulating electrical function.", "abstract": "Most cardiac arrhythmias are associated with pathology-triggered ion channel remodeling. However, multicellular effects, for example, exaggerated anisotropy and altered cell-to-cell coupling, can also indirectly affect action potential morphology and electrical stability via changed electrotonus. These changes are particularly relevant in structural heart disease, including hypertrophy and infarction. Recent computational studies showed that electrotonus factors into stability by altering dynamic properties (restitution). We experimentally address the question of how cell alignment and connectivity alter tissue function and whether these effects depend on the direction of wave propagation.\nWe show that cardiac cell arrangement can alter electrical stability in an in vitro cardiac tissue model by mechanisms both dependent and independent of the direction of wave propagation, and local structural remodeling can be felt beyond a space constant. Notably, restitution of action potential duration (APD) and conduction velocity was significantly steepened in the direction of cell alignment. Furthermore, prolongation of APD and calcium transient duration was found in highly anisotropic cell networks, both for longitudinal and transverse propagation. This is in contrast to expected correlation between wave propagation direction and APD based on electrotonic effects only, but is consistent with our findings of increased cell size and secretion of atrial natriuretic factor, a hypertrophy marker, in the aligned structures.\nOur results show that anisotropic structure is a potent modulator of electrical stability via electrotonus and molecular signaling.

{"title": "\"Turnover proteome\" of human atrial trabeculae.", "abstract": "Most of the biologically relevant data on cardiomyocytes are derived from isolated cells under conditions that are, to some extent, altered compared to the natural milieu of the functional heart. The handling procedure of the dissection, isolation, and short-term culturing induces changes in the cells such that the subsequently measured parameters (among others, the protein synthesis) reflect the actual experimental conduct rather than the intrinsic properties of these terminally differentiated cells. Although it is known that the protein synthetic machinery of isolated cardiomyocytes is operational and functional, the biosynthetic yield of human cardiomyocytes in the natural milieu of the trabeculae remains to be established, with a special emphasis to clarify whether the protein synthesis includes just a limited set of polypeptides or it encompasses all cellular constituents. Knowledge on this issue is a prerequisite for achieving further advances in our understanding of heart remodeling related to hypertrophy in particular, and for attempting interventions leading to repair of damaged heart in general. The experimental system of \"organ bath\" enables simultaneous registration of contractile forces of portions of cardiac muscle tissue (and other myocyte-containing tissues) and biosynthetic labeling of newly synthesized cellular constituents. The organ bath methodology was adapted for this project such as enabling to measure molecular changes in response to in vitro applied stimuli. Instead of Krebs-Henseleit-solution, as used in classical protocols of organ bath studies, we utilized cell culture media suitable to experimental conditions related to metabolic labeling. Proteome patterns established by performing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the extracts from biosynthetically labeled trabeculae revealed that cardiomyocytes synthesize the full spectrum of cellular proteins. Proteomic silver-stain readout was used to obtain samples for spot excisions, as material suitable for mass spectrometric analysis. Protein spots were identified both from the excised spots and also by matching with the in-house- and www-databases (Swiss-Prot/High-Performance Heart). From our findings that protein synthesis in terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes is not confined just to the synthesis of those structures needed for the post-mitotic house-keeping functions, we conclude that this model might serve as a valid experimental system to study and elucidate the effects of various pharmacological compounds under conditions where physiology (contractile forces) and biochemistry (protein synthesis) of intact human heart tissue are monitored simultaneously.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2007-10-06", "authors": ["Florian MLampert", "PeterMatt", "MartinGrapow", "IvanLefkovits", "Hans-ReinhardZerkowski", "ThomasGrussenmeyer"], "doi": "10.1021/pr0704229"}

Metoprolol treatment significantly prevented STZ-induced increase in triglyceride levels, but atenolol failed to produce this effect. Metoprolol exhibited a minimal improvement in STZ-induced bradycardia, whereas atenolol produced a further reduction in heart rate.

The method was based on the acquisition of three consecutive images of the same anatomical slice. One image has T(1)-weighted contrast in which infarction appears bright. The two other images are used to construct an anatomical image of the heart, which is combined with the first image to produce a black-blood viability image. However, using appropriate modulation and demodulation frequencies, the latter two images bear useful information about myocardial deformation that results in a cardiac strain-encoding (SENC) functional image. In this work, a method is proposed for obtaining three consecutive SENC images in a single acquisition that can be combined to produce a composite image of the heart, which shows both functional and viability information. The proposed technique reduces scan time by one-half, compared with separate acquisitions of functional and viability images, and alleviates misregistration problems caused by separate breathholds.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2007-09-28", "authors": ["El-Sayed HIbrahim", "MatthiasStuber", "Dara LKraitchman", "Robert GWeiss", "Nael FOsman"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.21390"}

Most studies on stem cell transplantation therapy in both experimental heart infarct and in phase-I human clinical trials have focused on the use of undifferentiated stem cells. Based on our previous observations demonstrating the presence of multipotent progenitor cells in human adult skeletal muscle, in this study we investigated the capacity of these progenitors to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Here we show an efficient protocol for the cardiomyogenic differentiation of human adult skeletal muscle stem cells in vitro. We found that treatment with Retinoic Acid directed cardiomyogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle stem cells in vitro. After Retinoic Acid treatment, cells expressed cardiomyocyte markers and acquired spontaneous contraction. Functional assays exhibited cardiac-like response to increased extracellular calcium. When cocultured with mouse cardiomyocytes, Retinoic Acid-treated skeletal muscle stem cells expressed connexin43 and when transplanted into ischemic heart were detectable even 5 weeks after injection. Based on these results, we can conclude that human adult skeletal muscle stem cells, if opportunely treated, can transdifferentiate into cells of cardiac lineage and once injected into infarcted heart can integrate, survive in cardiac tissue and improve the cardiac function.", "journal": "Experimental cell research", "date": "2007-09-25", "authors": ["GloriaInvernici", "SilviaCristini", "PaoloMadeddu", "StefanoBrock", "FrankSpillmann", "PiaBernasconi", "CristinaCappelletti", "ChiaraCalatozzolo", "UmbertoFascio", "GianluigiBisleri", "ClaudioMuneretto", "GiulioAlessandri", "Eugenio AParati"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.08.006"}
{"title": "Generation of functional multipotent adult stem cells from GPR125+ germline progenitors.", "abstract": "Adult mammalian testis is a source of pluripotent stem cells. However, the lack of specific surface markers has hampered identification and tracking of the unrecognized subset of germ cells that gives rise to multipotent cells. Although embryonic-like cells can be derived from adult testis cultures after only several weeks in vitro, it is not known whether adult self-renewing spermatogonia in long-term culture can generate such stem cells as well. Here, we show that highly proliferative adult spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) can be efficiently obtained by cultivation on mitotically inactivated testicular feeders containing CD34+ stromal cells. SPCs exhibit testicular repopulating activity in vivo and maintain the ability in long-term culture to give rise to multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells (MASCs). Furthermore, both SPCs and MASCs express GPR125, an orphan adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor. In knock-in mice bearing a GPR125-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) fusion protein under control of the native Gpr125 promoter (GPR125-LacZ), expression in the testis was detected exclusively in spermatogonia and not in differentiated germ cells. Primary GPR125-LacZ SPC lines retained GPR125 expression, underwent clonal expansion, maintained the phenotype of germline stem cells, and reconstituted spermatogenesis in busulphan-treated mice. Long-term cultures of GPR125+ SPCs (GSPCs) also converted into GPR125+ MASC colonies. GPR125+ MASCs generated derivatives of the three germ layers and contributed to chimaeric embryos, with concomitant downregulation of GPR125 during differentiation into GPR125- cells. MASCs also differentiated into contractile cardiac tissue in vitro and formed functional blood vessels in vivo. Molecular bookmarking by GPR125 in the adult mouse and, ultimately, in the human testis could enrich for a population of SPCs for derivation of GPR125+ MASCs, which may be employed for genetic manipulation, tissue regeneration and revascularization of ischaemic organs.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2007-09-21", "authors": ["MarcoSeandel", "DaylonJames", "Sergey VShmelkov", "IlariaFalciatori", "JiyeonKim", "SaiChavala", "Douglas SScherr", "FanZhang", "RichardTorres", "Nicholas WGale", "George DYancopoulos", "AndrewMurphy", "David MValenzuela", "Robin MHobbs", "Pier PaoloPandolfi", "ShahinRafii"], "doi": "10.1038/nature06129"}

Relative hyperoxic challenge during reoxygenation causes myocardial remodeling. Here, we sought to characterize the novel O(2)-sensitive molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering the differentiation of CFs to myofibroblasts. Exposure of CFs to hyperoxic challenge-induced transcription of smooth muscle actin (SMA) and enhanced the stability of both Acta2 transcript as well as of SMA protein. Both p21 deficiency as well as knockdown blunted hyperoxia-induced Acta2 and SMA response. Strikingly, overexpression of p21 alone markedly induced differentiation of CFs under normoxia. Overexpression of p21 alone induced SMA transcription by down-regulating YB1 and independent of TGFbeta1. In vivo, hyperoxic challenge induced p21-dependent differentiation of CFs to myofibroblasts in the infarct boundary region of ischemia-reperfused heart. Tissue elements were laser-captured from infarct boundary and from a noninfarct region 0.5 mm away. Reperfusion caused marked p21 induction in the infarct region. Acta2 as well as SMA expression were markedly up-regulated in CF-rich infarct boundary region.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether similar phenomena also occur after ischemia-reperfusion and whether cytokines other than TNF-alpha can also be involved. Anesthetized male Wistar rats were subjected to 1 h coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion. Cardiac geometry and function were assessed by echocardiography at days 5, 7, 8, and 10 postligation. Before death, heart function was assessed in vivo under basal conditions, as well as after volume overload. Finally, hearts were frozen for histoenzymologic assessment of infarct size and remodeling. The profile of cardiac cytokines was determined by ELISA and ChemiArray on heart tissue extracts. As expected, ischemia-reperfusion induced a progressive remodeling of the heart, characterized by left ventricular free-wall thinning and cavity dilation. Heart function was also decreased in ischemic rats during the first week after surgery. Interestingly, a transient and marked increase in TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) 2, CINC3, and macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha was also observed in the myocardium of myocardial ischemia (MI) animals at day 8, whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory interleukins IL-4 and IL-10 remained unchanged.

Because myofibroblasts as present in fibrotic remodeled myocardia and infarct scars depolarize cardiomyocytes by heterocellular electrotonic interactions via gap junctions in vitro, we investigated using strands of cultured ventricular cardiomyocytes coated with myofibroblasts, whether this interaction might give rise to depolarization-induced abnormal automaticity. Whereas uncoated cardiomyocyte strands were invariably quiescent, myofibroblasts induced synchronized spontaneous activity in a density dependent manner. Activations appeared at spatial myofibroblast densities >15.7% and involved more than 80% of the preparations at myofibroblast densities of 50%. Spontaneous activity was based on depolarization-induced automaticity as evidenced by: (1) suppression of activity by the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel opener P-1075; (2) induction of activity in current-clamped single cardiomyocytes undergoing depolarization to potentials similar to those induced by myofibroblasts in cardiomyocyte strands; and (3) induction of spontaneous activity in cardiomyocyte strands coated with connexin 43 transfected Hela cells but not with communication deficient HeLa wild-type cells.

Sudden death was found in 49% of the knockout (cVclKO) mice younger than 3 months of age despite preservation of contractile function. Conscious telemetry documented ventricular tachycardia as the cause of sudden death, while defective myocardial conduction was detected by optical mapping. cVclKO mice that survived through the vulnerable period of sudden death developed dilated cardiomyopathy and died before 6 months of age. Prior to the onset of cardiac dysfunction, ultrastructural analysis of cVclKO heart tissue showed abnormal adherens junctions with dissolution of the intercalated disc structure, expression of the junctional proteins cadherin and beta1D integrin were reduced, and the gap junction protein connexin 43 was mislocalized to the lateral myocyte border. This is the first report of tissue-specific inactivation of the Vcl gene and shows that it is required for preservation of normal cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive structures.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2007-09-06", "authors": ["Alice EZemljic-Harpf", "Joel CMiller", "Scott AHenderson", "Adam TWright", "Ana MariaManso", "LailaElsherif", "Nancy DDalton", "Andrea KThor", "Guy APerkins", "Andrew DMcCulloch", "Robert SRoss"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.00728-07"}
{"title": "The effect of adrenomedullin on the L-type calcium current in myocytes from septic shock rats: signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Adrenomedullin (ADM) is upregulated in cardiac tissue under various pathophysiological conditions, particularly in septic shock. The intracellular mechanisms involved in the effect of ADM on adult rat ventricular myocytes are still to be elucidated. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult rats 4 h after an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg). Membrane potential and L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) were determined using whole cell patch-clamp methods. APD in LPS group was significantly shorter than control values (time to 50% repolarization: LPS, 169 +/- 2 ms; control, 257 +/- 2 ms, P < 0.05; time to 90% repolarization: LPS, 220 +/- 2 ms; control, 305 +/- 2 ms, P < 0.05). I(Ca,L) density was significantly reduced in myocytes from the LPS group (-3.2 +/- 0.8 pA/pF) compared with that of control myocytes (-6.7 +/- 0.3 pA/pF, P < 0.05). The ADM antagonist ADM-(22-52) reversed the shortened APD and abolished the reduction of I(Ca,L) in shock myocytes. In myocytes from control rats, incubating with ADM for 1 h induced a marked decrease in peak I(Ca,L) density. This effect was reversed by ADM-(22-52). The G(i) protein inhibitor, pertussis toxin (PTX), the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, KT-5720, and the specific cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, nimesulide, reversed the LPS-induced reduction in peak I(Ca,L). The results suggest a COX-2-involved PKA-dependent switch from G(s) coupled to PTX-sensitive G(i) coupling by ADM in adult rat ventricular myocytes. The present study delineates the intracellular pathways involved in ADM-mediated effects on I(Ca,L) in adult rat ventricular myocytes and also suggests a role of ADM in sepsis.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

A conservative estimate of the number of dead drum was approximately 100 metric tonnes. Large numbers of dead round goby Neogobius melanostomus were also seen, as well as a few muskellunge Esox masquinongy. In the drum, there was a consistent histological pattern of variably severe panvasculitis, a necrotising myocarditis, meningoencephalitis and a segmental enteritis. Moderate numbers of bullet-shaped viral particles consistent with a rhabdovirus were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in affected heart tissue. Following primary isolation from pooled tissues on fathead minnow (FHM) cells, a morphologically similar virus, approximately 165 x 60 nm in size, was visualised. Identification of the isolate as viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was confirmed by enzyme immunoassay and by polymerase chain reaction. An appropriately sized product (468 bp) of the G-glycoprotein gene (nucleotides [nt] 340 to 807) was generated with RNA extracted from FHM cell supernatant. Analysis of a 360 nt partial glycoprotein gene sequence (nt 360 to 720) indicated a 96.4 to 97.2% nucleotide identity with known strains of North American (NA) VHSV. Analysis using Neighbour-joining distance methods assigned the isolate to the same lineage as the NA and Japanese isolates (Genogroup IV). However, there was sufficient sequence divergence from known NA VHSV isolates to suggest that this isolate may represent a distinct subgroup.

{"title": "Cell therapy in congestive heart failure.", "abstract": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) has emerged as a major worldwide epidemic and its main causes seem to be the aging of the population and the survival of patients with post-myocardial infarction. Cardiomyocyte dropout (necrosis and apoptosis) plays a critical role in the progress of CHF; thus treatment of CHF by exogenous cell implantation will be a promising medical approach. In the acute phase of cardiac damage cardiac stem cells (CSCs) within the heart divide symmetrically and/or asymmetrically in response to the change of heart homeostasis, and at the same time homing of bone marrow stem cells (BMCs) to injured area is thought to occur, which not only reconstitutes CSC population to normal levels but also repairs the heart by differentiation into cardiac tissue. So far, basic studies by using potential sources such as BMCs and CSCs to treat animal CHF have shown improved ventricular remodelling and heart function.

In ascidian embryos, FGF/MAPK-mediated activation of the transcription factor Ets1/2 is required for heart tissue specification and cell migration. We found that FoxF is one of the first genes to be activated in heart precursors in response to FGF signaling. We identified the FoxF minimal heart enhancer and used a cis-trans complementation test to show that Ets1/2 can interact with the FoxF enhancer in vivo. Next, we found that FoxF function is required downstream and in parallel to the FGF/MAPK/Ets cascade for cell migration. In addition, we demonstrated that targeted expression of a dominant-negative form of FoxF inhibits cell migration but not heart differentiation, resulting in a striking phenotype: a beating heart at an ectopic location within the body cavity of juveniles. Taken together, our results indicate that FoxF is a direct target of FGF signaling and is predominantly involved in the regulation of heart cell migration.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2007-08-28", "authors": ["JeniBeh", "WeiyangShi", "MikeLevine", "BradDavidson", "LionelChristiaen"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.010140"}
{"title": "Impact of temperature on cross-bridge cycling kinetics in rat myocardium.", "abstract": "The dependence of contractile properties on intracellular calcium in cardiac tissue is a highly cooperative process. Here, the temperature and calcium dependence of contractile and energetical properties in permeabilized cardiac trabeculae from rat were studied to provide novel insights into the underlying kinetic processes. Myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity significantly increased with temperature between 15 and 25 degrees C, whereas its steepness was independent of temperature. A direct proportionality between active tension and Ca(2+)-activated rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed; the slope of this relationship (tension cost) was highly temperature dependent. The rate of tension redevelopment following a quick release-restretch manoeuvre (k(tr)) depended in a complex manner on the level of contractile activation and on temperature. At saturating calcium levels, the temperature dependence (Q(10)) of k(tr) and Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis rate were similar (Q(10) approximately 3.5), and significantly higher than the Q(10) for maximum tension (T(max); Q(10) approximately 1.3) or tension cost (Q(10) approximately 2.5). In contrast, at a low level of contractile activation ( approximately 5% of T(max)), the Q(10) of k(tr) was similar to that of tension cost, and significantly lower than the Q(10) of Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis at that level of contractile activation. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that at high levels of contractile activation, the rates of tension redevelopment and Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis are determined by both apparent cross-bridge attachment and detachment rates, while at low levels, k(tr) is limited by cross-bridge detachment rate. Tension cost, on the other hand, is determined solely by cross-bridge detachment kinetics at all temperatures and levels of contractile activation.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2007-08-25", "authors": ["Pieter Pde Tombe", "G J MStienen"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2007.138693"}
{"title": "Kinin B1 receptor participates in the control of cardiac function in mice.", "abstract": "The kinins have an important role in control of the cardiovascular system. They have been associated with protective effects in the heart tissue. Kinins act through stimulation of two 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, denoted B(1) and B(2) receptors. However, the physiological relevance of B(1) receptor in the heart has not been clearly established. Using B(1) kinin receptor gene knock-out mice we tested the hypothesis that the B(1) receptor plays an important role in the control of baseline cardiac function. We examined the functional aspects of the intact heart and also in the isolated cardiomyocytes to study intracellular Ca(2+) cycling by using confocal microscopy and whole-cell voltage clamp techniques. We measured heart rate, diastolic and systolic tension, contraction and relaxation rates and, coronary perfusion pressure. Whole-cell voltage clamp was performed to measure L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)). The hearts from B(1)(-/-) mice showed smaller systolic tension. The average values for WT and B(1)(-/-) mice were 2.6+/-0.04 g vs. 1.6+/-0.08 g, respectively. This result can be explained, at least in part, by the decrease in the Ca(2+) transient (3.1+/-0.06 vs. 3.4+/-0.09 for B(1)(-/-) and WT, respectively). There was an increase in I(Ca,L) at depolarized membrane potentials. Interestingly, the inactivation kinetics of I(Ca,L) was statistically different between the groups. The coronary perfusion pressure was higher in the hearts from B(1)(-/-) mice indicating an increase in coronary resistance.

PV-ir was observed in the walls of all four cardiac chambers (left and right atria and left and right ventricles), with the left ventricle, in general, having the highest labeling intensity.

{"title": "Molecular regulation and pharmacology of pacemaker channels.", "abstract": "The spontaneous activity of cardiac tissue originates in specialized pacemaker cells in the sino-atrial node that generate autonomous rhythmic electrical impulses. A number of regions in the brain are also able to generate spontaneous rhythmic activity to control and regulate important physiological functions. The generation of pacemaker potentials relies on a complex interplay between different types of currents carried by cation channels. Among these currents, the hyperpolarization-activated current (termed I(f), cardiac pacemaker \"funny\" current, and I(h) in neurons) is the major component contributing to the initiation of cardiac and neuronal excitability and to the modulation of this excitability by neurotransmitters and hormones. I(f) is an inward current activated by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and by intracellular cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP. The identification at the end of the 1990s of a family of mammalian genes that encode for four Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels, HCN1-4, has made analysis of the location of these channels and the study of their biophysical properties an obtainable goal. As a result, specific agents have been developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate by lowering cardiac pacemaker activity where f-channels are their main natural target. These drugs include alinidine, zatebradine, cilobradine, ZD-7288 and ivabradine. Recent data indicate that pharmacological tools such as W7 and genistein, which have been used to identify some intracellular pathways involved in ionic channel modulation, also have the ability to inhibit I(f) directly.

{"title": "Cardiovascular responses produced by 5-hydroxytriptamine:a pharmacological update on the receptors/mechanisms involved and therapeutic implications.", "abstract": "The complexity of cardiovascular responses produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), including bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, and vasodilatation or vasoconstriction, has been explained by the capability of this monoamine to interact with different receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), on the autonomic ganglia and postganglionic nerve endings, on vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, and on the cardiac tissue. Depending, among other factors, on the species, the vascular bed under study, and the experimental conditions, these responses are mainly mediated by 5-HT(1), 5-HT(2), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(4), 5-ht(5A/5B), and 5-HT(7) receptors as well as by a tyramine-like action or unidentified mechanisms. It is noteworthy that 5-HT(6) receptors do not seem to be involved in the cardiovascular responses to 5-HT. Regarding heart rate, intravenous (i.v.) administration of 5-HT usually lowers this variable by eliciting a von Bezold-Jarisch-like reflex via 5-HT(3) receptors located on sensory vagal nerve endings in the heart. Other bradycardic mechanisms include cardiac sympatho-inhibition by prejunctional 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and, in the case of the rat, an additional 5-ht(5A/5B) receptor component. Moreover, i.v. 5-HT can increase heart rate in different species (after vagotomy) by a variety of mechanisms/receptors including activation of: (1) myocardial 5-HT(2A) (rat), 5-HT(3) (dog), 5-HT(4) (pig, human), and 5-HT(7) (cat) receptors; (2) adrenomedullary 5-HT(2) (dog) and prejunctional sympatho-excitatory 5-HT(3) (rabbit) receptors associated with a release of catecholamines; (3) a tyramine-like action mechanism (guinea pig); and (4) unidentified mechanisms (certain lamellibranch and gastropod species). Furthermore, central administration of 5-HT can cause, in general, bradycardia and/or tachycardia mediated by activation of, respectively, 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors. On the other hand, the blood pressure response to i.v. administration of 5-HT is usually triphasic and consists of an initial short-lasting vasodepressor response due to a reflex bradycardia (mediated by 5-HT(3) receptors located on vagal afferents, via the von Bezold-Jarisch-like reflex), a middle vasopressor phase, and a late, longer-lasting, vasodepressor response. The vasopressor response is a consequence of vasoconstriction mainly mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptors; however, vasoconstriction in the canine saphenous vein and external carotid bed as well as in the porcine cephalic arteries and arteriovenous anastomoses is due to activation of 5-HT(1B) receptors. The late vasodepressor response may involve three different mechanisms: (1) direct vasorelaxation by activation of 5-HT(7) receptors located on vascular smooth muscle; (2) inhibition of the vasopressor sympathetic outflow by sympatho-inhibitory 5-HT(1A/1B/1D) receptors; and (3) release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide) by 5-HT(2B) and/or 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors. Furthermore, central administration of 5-HT can cause both hypotension (mainly mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors) and hypertension (mainly mediated by 5-HT(2) receptors). The increasing availability of new compounds with high affinity and selectivity for the different 5-HT receptor subtypes makes it possible to develop drugs with potential therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of some cardiovascular illnesses including hypertension, migraine, some peripheral vascular diseases, and heart failure.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2007-08-19", "authors": ["Carlos MVillal\u00f3n", "DavidCenturi\u00f3n"], "doi": "10.1007/s00210-007-0179-1"}

In 22 cases (13 carriers and nine patients) not yet transplanted median follow-up was 3.3 years (range 0.4-11.3). We found a significant increase in the amyloid grade of fat tissue from 2+ to 4+ and from 0 to 4+ in two of three subjects with follow-ups of >7 years, after 7 and 11 years, respectively. All other subjects remained negative or did not show a significant change. In 11 liver transplant patients, follow-up with fat aspirate was available with a median duration of 3.1 years (range 1.0-10.1). A comparison was made with cardiac amyloid as judged by the cardiac septum diameter and the serum NT-ProBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) level. No stable increase of amyloid in fat was seen in any patient. A stable decrease of amyloid grade was seen in one patient 5 years after transplantation. In contrast, the cardiac septum diameter increased >or=4 mm in six of the 11 transplant patients. Our study shows the diagnostic utility of a regularly repeated fat aspirate in carriers at risk for the development of ATTR amyloidosis. Evolution of amyloid deposition in fat tissue is very gradual.

We investigated the cardioprotective effect of the PARP inhibitor, INO-1153, in isolated working rat hearts after 6 hr of hypothermic storage in Celsior.\nHearts were treated with 1 muM INO-1153 before hypothermic storage, at cardioplegia and storage or after hypothermic storage. Hearts not exposed to INO-1153 served as controls. Another group was pretreated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin (0.1 muM) before storage in INO-1153-supplemented Celsior. After baseline measurement of aortic flow, heart rate, coronary flow, and cardiac output were obtained, hearts were arrested and stored in Celsior at 2-3 degrees C for 6 hr. After storage, hearts were reperfused for 15 min before performing work for a further 30 min, at which time poststorage indices of cardiac function were remeasured then heart tissue was stored at -80 degrees C for Western blot analysis.\nThe presence of INO-1153 during prestorage perfusion or during cardioplegia and storage significantly improved poststorage cardiac function. Functional improvements produced by INO-1153 were completely abolished by Wortmnanin pretreatment. Western blots showed a significant increase in phospho-Akt in presence of INO-1153, which was inhibited by Wortmannin.\nActivation of the prosurvival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway was involved in the protective action of PARP inhibition in this model of donor heart procurement and hypothermic storage.

Simultaneously changes in lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in renal and cardiac tissues (which are commonly affected in diabetes mellitus), were also investigated. Administration of dexamethasone (1.0 mg/kg/day intramuscularly for 28 days) caused hyperglycaemia with a parallel increase in serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides and tissue lipid peroxidation with a decrease in serum levels of both the thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, T(3) and thyroxine, T(4)) and in the activity of associated tissue antioxidants such as superoxide, catalase and glutathione.

{"title": "Low coronary driving pressure early in the course of myocardial infarction is associated with subendocardial remodelling and left ventricular dysfunction.", "abstract": "Subendocardial remodelling of the left ventricular (LV) non-infarcted myocardium has been poorly investigated. Previously, we have demonstrated that low coronary driving pressure (CDP) early postinfarction was associated with the subsequent development of remote subendocardial fibrosis. The present study aimed at examining the role of CDP in LV remodelling and function following infarction. Haemodynamics were performed in Wistar rats immediately after myocardial infarction (MI group) or sham surgery (SH group) and at days 1, 3, 7 and 28. Heart tissue sections were stained with HE, Sirius red and immunostained for alpha-actin. Two distinct LV regions remote to infarction were examined: subendocardium (SE) and interstitium (INT). Myocyte necrosis, leucocyte infiltration, myofibroblasts and collagen volume fraction were determined. Compared with SH, MI showed lower CDP and LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Necrosis was evident in SE at day 1. Inflammation and fibroplasia predominated in SE as far as day 7. Fibrosis was restricted to SE from day 3 on. Inflammation occurred in INT at days 1 and 3, but at a lower grade than in SE. CDP correlated inversely with SE necrosis (r = -0.65, P = 0.003, at day 1), inflammation (r = -0.76, P < 0.001, at day 1), fibroplasia (r = -0.47, P = 0.04, at day 7) and fibrosis (r = -0.83, P < 0.001, at day 28).

Increased iNOS expression on cardiac tissue may represent a more intensive tissue injury during ischemia and reperfusion in heart transplantation. The aim of this study was, therefore, to test the hypothesis that increased iNOS expression in early postoperative endomyocardial biopsies correlates with rejection or infection episodes in the later postoperative course.\nRight ventricular endomyocardial biopsies were obtained from heart transplantation recipients at transplantation and during the first 2 weeks postoperatively. The recipients were divided into three groups depending on the postoperative course during the first year after transplantation: patients in group 1 had an uncomplicated postoperative course, patients in group 2 developed significant signs of postoperative infection, while patients in group 3 presented with acute rejection (< or =grade 2R ISHLT). The expression was analyzed in a semi-quantitative score.\niNOS expression was found in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, infiltrating cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. At the time of heart transplantation, the expression was significantly increased in the rejection group compared to the other groups. This increase was even more pronounced in week 2.\nThe present study shows that an increased iNOS expression at the time of heart transplantation could precede an acute rejection in the later postoperative course.

Alignment of sequences showed that PRL-2 is highly conserved among species, including two species of hibernating bats (R. ferrumequinum and Myotis ricketti).

Our results thus reveal that carnitine along with lipoic acid can be used as an effective supplement against free radical induced damage to the cardiac tissue.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2007-08-07", "authors": ["SethumadhavanSavitha", "BalasubramanianNaveen", "ChinnakannuPanneerselvam"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.07.016"}
{"title": "Circumferential lesion formation around the pulmonary veins in the left atrium with focused ultrasound using a 2D-array endoesophageal device: a numerical study.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequently sustained cardiac arrhythmia affecting humans. The electrical isolation by ablation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) in the left atrium (LA) of the heart has been proven as an effective cure of AF. The ablation consists mainly in the formation of a localized circumferential thermal coagulation of the cardiac tissue surrounding the PVs. In the present numerical study, the feasibility of producing the required circumferential lesion with an endoesophageal ultrasound probe is investigated. The probe operates at 1 MHz and consists of a 2D array with enough elements (114 x 20) to steer the acoustic field electronically in a volume comparable to the LA. Realistic anatomical conditions of the thorax were considered from the segmentation of histological images of the thorax. The cardiac muscle and the blood-filled cavities in the heart were identified and considered in the sound propagation and thermal models. The influence of different conditions of the thermal sinking in the LA chamber was also studied. The circumferential ablation of the PVs was achieved by the sum of individual lesions induced with the proposed device. Different scenarios of lesion formation were considered where ultrasound exposures (1, 2, 5 and 10 s) were combined with maximal peak temperatures (60, 70 and 80 degrees C). The results of this numerical study allowed identifying the limits and best conditions for controlled lesion formation in the LA using the proposed device. A controlled situation for the lesion formation surrounding the PVs was obtained when the targets were located within a distance from the device in the range of 26 +/- 7 mm. When combined with a maximal temperature of 70 degrees C and an exposure time between 5 and 10 s, this distance ensured preservation of the esophageal structures, controlled lesion formation and delivery of an acoustic intensity at the transducer surface that is compatible with existing materials. With a peak temperature of 70 degrees C, the device and setup presented here induced highly localized lesions with a lesion volume varying from 10 +/- 4 to 18 +/- 7 mm(3) for an ultrasound exposure between 5 and 10 s, respectively, while the intensity varied from 26 +/- 7 to 20 +/- 6 W cm(-2).", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2007-08-03", "authors": ["SamuelPichardo", "KullervoHynynen"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/52/16/014"}
{"title": "Akt activation and augmented fibronectin production in hyperhexosemia.", "abstract": "Dysmetabolic state in diabetes may lead to augmented synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In the endothelial cells, we have previously demonstrated that glucose-induced fibronectin (FN) production and that of its splice variant, EDB(+)FN, is regulated by protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt). In this study, we investigated the role of Akt1 in ECM protein production in the organs affected by chronic diabetic complications. We studied Akt1/PKBalpha knockout mice and wild-type control littermates. To avoid confounding effects of systemic insulin, we used 30% galactose feeding to induce hyperhexosemia for 8 wk starting at 6 wk of age. We investigated FN mRNA, EDB(+)FN mRNA, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta mRNA expression, Akt phosphorylation, Akt kinase activity, and NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation in the retina, heart, and kidney. Renal and cardiac tissues were histologically examined. Galactose feeding caused significant upregulation of FN, EDB(+)FN, and TGF-beta in all tissues. FN protein levels paralleled mRNA. Such upregulation were prevented in Akt1-deficient galactose-fed mice. Galactose feeding caused ECM protein deposition in the glomeruli and in the myocardium, which was prevented in the Akt knockout mice. NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation was pronounced in galactose-fed wild-type mice and prevented in the galactose-fed Akt1/PKBalpha-deficient group. In the retina and kidney, Ser473 was the predominant site for Akt phosphorylation, whereas in the heart it was Thr308. Parallel experiment in streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals showed similar results. The data from this study indicate that hyperhexosemia-induced Akt/PKB activation may be an important mechanism leading to NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation and increased ECM protein synthesis in the organs affected by chronic diabetic complications.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Shotgun metabolomics approach for the analysis of negatively charged water-soluble cellular metabolites from mouse heart tissue.", "abstract": "A shotgun metabolomics approach using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid analysis of negatively charged water-soluble cellular metabolites. Through the use of neutral organic solvents to inactivate endogenous enzyme activities (i.e., methanol/chloroform/H2O extraction), in conjunction with a matrix having minimal background noise (9-amnioacridine), a set of multiplexed conditions was developed that allowed identification of 285 peaks corresponding to negatively charged metabolites from mouse heart extracts. Identification of metabolite peaks was based on mass accuracy and was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry for 90 of the identified metabolite peaks. Through multiplexing ionization conditions, new suites of metabolites could be ionized and \"spectrometric isolation\" of closely neighboring peaks for subsequent tandem mass spectrometric interrogation could be achieved. Moreover, assignments of ions from isomeric metabolites and quantitation of their relative abundance was achieved in many cases through tandem mass spectrometry by identification of diagnostic fragmentation ions (e.g., discrimination of ATP from dGTP). The high sensitivity of this approach facilitated the detection of extremely low abundance metabolites including important signaling metabolites such as IP3, cAMP, and cGMP.

{"title": "Gap junction channels and cardiac impulse propagation.", "abstract": "The role of gap junction channels on cardiac impulse propagation is complex. This review focuses on the differential expression of connexins in the heart and the biophysical properties of gap junction channels under normal and disease conditions. Structural determinants of impulse propagation have been gained from biochemical and immunocytochemical studies performed on tissue extracts and intact cardiac tissue. These have defined the distinctive connexin coexpression patterns and relative levels in different cardiac tissues. Functional determinants of impulse propagation have emerged from electrophysiological experiments carried out on cell pairs. The static properties (channel number and conductance) limit the current flow between adjacent cardiomyocytes and thus set the basic conduction velocity. The dynamic properties (voltage-sensitive gating and kinetics of channels) are responsible for a modulation of the conduction velocity during propagated action potentials. The effect is moderate and depends on the type of Cx and channel. For homomeric-homotypic channels, the influence is small to medium; for homomeric-heterotypic channels, it is medium to strong. Since no data are currently available on heteromeric channels, their influence on impulse propagation is speculative. The modulation by gap junction channels is most prominent in tissues at the boundaries between cardiac tissues such as sinoatrial node-atrial muscle, atrioventricular node-His bundle, His bundle-bundle branch and Purkinje fibers-ventricular muscle.

However, the degree to which stem cells or precursor cells contribute to the renewal of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes remains controversial. Here we report evidence that stem cells or precursor cells contribute to the replacement of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes after injury but do not contribute significantly to cardiomyocyte renewal during normal aging. We generated double-transgenic mice to track the fate of adult cardiomyocytes in a 'pulse-chase' fashion: after a 4-OH-tamoxifen pulse, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was induced only in cardiomyocytes, with 82.7% of cardiomyocytes expressing GFP. During normal aging up to one year, the percentage of GFP+ cardiomyocytes remained unchanged, indicating that stem or precursor cells did not refresh uninjured cardiomyocytes at a significant rate during this period of time. By contrast, after myocardial infarction or pressure overload, the percentage of GFP+ cardiomyocytes decreased from 82.8% in heart tissue from sham-treated mice to 67.5% in areas bordering a myocardial infarction, 76.6% in areas away from a myocardial infarction, and 75.7% in hearts subjected to pressure overload, indicating that stem cells or precursor cells had refreshed the cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Nature medicine", "date": "2007-07-31", "authors": ["Patrick C HHsieh", "Vincent F MSegers", "Michael EDavis", "CatherineMacGillivray", "JosephGannon", "Jeffery DMolkentin", "JeffreyRobbins", "Richard TLee"], "doi": "10.1038/nm1618"}
{"title": "Quantification of shock-induced microscopic virtual electrodes assessed by subcellular resolution optical potential mapping in guinea pig papillary muscle.", "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was the quantitative description of shock-induced, locally occurring virtual electrodes in natural cardiac tissue.\nMultiscale optical potential mapping using 10x, 20x, and 40x magnifying objectives, achieving resolutions of 0.13, 0.065, and 0.033 mm, was performed when applying uniform shocks (+/-10 V/cm, 5 ms) during diastole and action potential plateau. A procedure was developed to identify local potential deviations as depolarizing or hyperpolarizing peaks and to quantify their occurrence and characteristic amplitudes, lateral extents, and dynamics. At shock onset, peaks of either polarity developed significantly faster (tau = 0.92 +/- 0.65 ms, N = 64) than the average bulk polarization (tau = 2.25 +/- 0.96 ms, P < 0.001) and appeared locally fixed, changing their polarity at shock reversal. The mean peak magnitude (21.2 +/- 12 mV) and the amplitude distribution were essentially independent from the magnification. The peak density continuously increased with decreasing peak extent (taken at 70% of the amplitude), reaching a maximum of approximately 3 peaks/mm2 in the range of approximately 30-65 microm. There was no correlation between peak amplitude and size throughout. Potentially exciting peaks were found with a density of 0.04-0.2 peaks/mm2 corresponding to estimated 1-5 peaks/mm3.\nOur results suggest that microscopic inhomogeneities form a substantial substrate for far-field excitation in natural cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Minimizing artifacts resulting from respiratory and cardiac motion by optimization of the transmission scan in cardiac PET/CT.", "abstract": "The introduction of positron emission/computed tomography (PET/CT) systems coupled with multidetector CT arrays has greatly increased the amount of clinical information in myocardial perfusion studies. The CT acquisition serves the dual role of providing high spatial anatomical detail and attenuation correction for PET. However, the differences between the interaction of respiratory and cardiac cycles in the CT and PET acquisitions presents a challenge when using the CT to determine PET attenuation correction. Three CT attenuation correction protocols were tested for their ability to produce accurate emission images: gated, a step mode acquisition covering the diastolic heart phase; normal, a high-pitch helical CT; and slow, a low-pitch, low-temporal-resolution helical CT. The amount of cardiac tissue in the emission image that overlaid lung tissue in the transmission image was used as the measure of mismatch between acquisitions. Phantom studies simulating misalignment of the heart between the transmission and emission sequences were used to correlate the amount of mismatch with the artificial defect changes in the emission image. Consecutive patients were studied prospectively with either paired gated (diastolic phase, 120 kVp, 280 mA, 2.6 s) and slow CT (0.562:1 pitch, 120 kVp, Auto-mA, 16 s) or paired normal (0.938:1 pitch, 120 kVp, Auto-mA, 4.8 s) and slow CT protocols, prior to a Rb-82 perfusion study. To determine the amount of mismatch, the transmission and emission images were converted to binary representations of attenuating tissue and cardiac tissue and overlaid using their native registration. The number of cardiac tissue pixels from the emission image present in the CT lung field yielded the magnitude of misalignment represented in terms of volume, of where a small volume indicates better registration. Acquiring a slow CT improved registration between the transmission and emission acquisitions compared to the gated and normal CT protocols. The volume of PET cardiac tissue in the CT lung field was significantly lower (p < 0.03) for the slow CT protocol in both the rest and stress emission studies. Phantom studies showed that an overlaying volume greater than 2.6 mL would produce significant artificial defects as determined by a quantitative software package that employs a normal database. The percentage of patient studies with overlaying volume greater than 2.6 mL was reduced from 71% with the normal CT protocol to 28% with the slow CT protocol. The remaining 28% exhibited artifacts consistent with heart drift and patient motion that could not be corrected by adjusting the CT acquisition protocol. The low pitch of the slow CT protocol provided the best match to the emission study and is recommended for attenuation correction in cardiac PET/CT studies. Further reduction in artifacts arising from cardiac drift is required and warrants an image registration solution.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2007-07-28", "authors": ["Jonathon ANye", "FabioEsteves", "John RVotaw"], "doi": "10.1118/1.2731033"}

Doxorubicin is able to be reductively activated to produce damaging reactive oxygen species. Iron-dependent cellular damage is thought to be responsible for its cardiotoxicity.

{"title": "Electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes isolated from CYP2J2 transgenic mice.", "abstract": "CYP2J2 is abundant in cardiac tissue and active in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). To determine the effects of CYP2J2 and its eicosanoid products in the heart, we characterized the electrophysiology of single cardiomyocytes isolated from adult transgenic (Tr) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of CYP2J2. CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes had a shortened action potential. At 90% repolarization, the action potential duration (APD) was 30.6 +/- 3.0 ms (n = 22) in wild-type (Wt) cells and 20.2 +/- 2.3 ms (n = 19) in CYP2J2 Tr cells (p < 0.005). This shortening was probably due to enhanced maximal peak transient outward K(+) currents (I(to,peak)), which were 38.6 +/- 2.8 and 54.4 +/- 4.9 pA/pF in Wt and CYP2J2 Tr cells, respectively (p < 0.05). In contrast, the late portion of the transient outward K(+) current (I(to,280ms)), the slowly inactivating outward K(+) current (I(K,slow)), and the voltage-gated Na(+) current (I(Na)) were not significantly altered in CYP2J2 Tr cells. N-Methylsulphonyl-6-(2-proparglyloxy-phenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH), a specific inhibitor of EET biosynthesis, significantly reduced I(to,peak) and increased APD in CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes but not in Wt cells. Intracellular dialysis with a monoclonal antibody against CYP2J2 also significantly reduced I(to,peak) and increased APD in CYP2J2 Tr cardiomyocytes. Addition of 11,12-EET or 8-bromo-cAMP significantly reversed the MS-PPOH- or monoclonal antibody-induced changes in I(to,peak) and APD in CYP2J2 Tr cells.

In this study, we examined the relationship between proteome alterations, mitochondrial function, and major biochemical and electrophysiological changes affecting cardiac performance during simulated short-term hyperglycemia. Two-dimensional comparative proteomics analysis of rat hearts perfused with glucose at high (30 mM) or control (5.5 mM) levels revealed that glucose loading alters cardiomyocyte proteomes. It increased expression levels of initial enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and of enzymes of fatty acid beta-oxidation, with consequent up-regulation of enzymes of mitochondrial electron transport. It also markedly decreased expression of enzymes of glycolysis and the final steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glucose loading increased the rate of Bax-independent apoptosis. High glucose increased the duration of the action potential and elevated level of intracellular cytoplasmic calcium. Surprisingly, glucose loading did not influence levels of nitric oxide or mitochondrial superoxide in isolated cardiomyocytes.

Therefore, we investigated the influence of Pycnogenol supplementation (30 mg/kg) on left ventricular function and myocardial extracellular matrix composition in old C57BL/6N mice following induction of cardiac remodeling by chronic nitric oxide synthase blockade by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) administration. L-NAME-treated mice demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy at compensated state, associated with a significant increase of pro-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 gene expression and activity, a marked decrease in pro-collagen IIIalpha1 gene expression, and a subsequent reduction in cardiac total and cross-linked collagen content. Upon supplementation with Pycnogenol in L-NAME-exposed mice, cardiac gene expression patterns for pro-MMP-2, -9, and -13, and MMP-9 activity were significantly decreased, associated with a significant increase in cardiac tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-4 expression. These findings were coincided with a marked increase in myocardial total and cross-linked collagen content, compared with L-NAME-only-treated mice. Moreover, Pycnogenol treatment was associated with reversal of L-NAME-induced alternations in hemodynamic parameters.

However, in vitro expansion of infiltrating T cells from heart biopsy-derived fragments with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and phytohaemagglutinin leads to the outgrowth of CD4(+) over CD8(+) T cells. We hypothesized that survival cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 might be differentially involved in the growth and maintenance of heart-infiltrating and peripheral CD8(+) T cells from CCC patients. We found that IL-7 and IL-15 were superior to IL-2 in the expansion and viability of CD8(+) T cells from both PBMC and heart-infiltrating T-cell lines from CCC patients, and the combination of the three cytokines showed synergic effects. Heart-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells showed higher expression of both IL-15R alpha and gamma(c) chain than CD4(+) T cells, which may explain the improvement of CD8(+) T-cell growth in the presence of IL-2 + IL-7 + IL-15.

In addition to the previously characterized arginine-rich PTDs, including Tat (transactivator of transcription), Antp (Antennapedia) and PTD-5, we have demonstrated that lysine and ornithine, as well as arginine, homopolymers are able to mediate transduction of a wide variety of agents. To screen for optimal PTDs, we have used as a therapeutic cargo a peptide derived from IKK {IkappaB [inhibitor of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB)] kinase} beta, able to bind to the IKK regulatory subunit [NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator)], preventing formation of an active kinase complex. This peptide, termed NBD, is able to block activation of NF-kappaB, but not basal activity. We demonstrate that PTD-mediated delivery of NBD using certain PTDs, in particular 8K (octalysine), is therapeutic following systemic delivery in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and muscular dystrophy. In addition, we have developed a peptide phage display library screening method for novel transduction peptides able to facilitate tissue-specific internalization of marker protein complexes. Using this approach, we have identified transduction peptides that are able to facilitate internalization of large protein complexes into tumours, airway epithelia, synovial fibroblasts, cardiac tissue and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells in culture and/or in vivo.", "journal": "Biochemical Society transactions", "date": "2007-07-20", "authors": ["JTilstra", "K KRehman", "THennon", "S EPlevy", "PClemens", "P DRobbins"], "doi": "10.1042/BST0350811"}

AVP-specific RIA, RT-PCR, and immunoblot measurement of AVP receptors (VR) were used to investigate heart tissues from newborn and adult rats. To test AVP's role in differentiation and specialization into ventricle-like cardiomyocytes, we studied GFP-P19Cl6 stem cells, which express green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter under transcriptional control of the myosin light chain-2v promoter. VR(1) transcripts and proteins were higher in adult than in newborn rat hearts. In contrast, VR(2) increased from postnatal day 1 to 5 and was barely detected in the adult rat heart. In cardiomyocytes expressing troponin C, immunofluorescence revealed VR(2) and VR(1). Intracellular cAMP increased 6.5- and 8.9-fold in response to the selective VR(2) agonist 1-desamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) after 1 and 24 h, respectively. Cardiac AVP was high in 1- and 5-day-old (330 +/- 26 and 276 +/- 53 pg/mg protein, respectively) but low in 66-day-old (98 +/- 15 pg/mg protein) rats. AVP immunostaining was detected in the tunica adventitia and endothelium of the coronary vessels. The possible role of AVP in cardiomyogenesis was indicated by DDAVP-AVP-dependent differentiation of GFP-P19Cl6 stem cells into contracting cells displaying GATA-4, a cardiac-specific marker, and ventricle-specific myosin light chain.

{"title": "Protein kinase C as a stress sensor.", "abstract": "While there are many reviews which examine the group of proteins known as protein kinase C (PKC), the focus of this article is to examine the cellular roles of two PKCs that are important for stress responses in neurological tissues (PKC gamma and epsilon) and in cardiac tissues (PKC epsilon). These two kinases, in particular, seem to have overlapping functions and interact with an identical target, connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein which is central to proper control of signals in both tissues. While PKC gamma and PKC epsilon both help protect neural tissue from ischemia, PKC epsilon is the primary PKC isoform responsible for responding to decreased oxygen, or ischemia, in the heart. Both do this through Cx43. It is clear that both PKC gamma and PKC epsilon are necessary for protection from ischemia. However, the importance of these kinases has been inferred from preconditioning experiments which demonstrate that brief periods of hypoxia protect neurological and cardiac tissues from future insults, and that this depends on the activation, translocation, or ability for PKC gamma and/or PKC epsilon to interact with distinct cellular targets, especially Cx43. This review summarizes the recent findings which define the roles of PKC gamma and PKC epsilon in cardiac and neurological functions and their relationships to ischemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, a biochemical comparison of PKC gamma and PKC epsilon and a proposed argument for why both forms are present in neurological tissue while only PKC epsilon is present in heart, are discussed.

Small interfering (si)RNAs mediate gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) and may be used to knockdown PKCalpha in cardiomyocytes. However, transfection efficiencies of (si)RNAs by lipofection tend to be low in primary cells. To address this limitation, we developed an adenoviral vector (AV) driving short hairpin (sh)RNAs against PKCalpha (Ad-shPKCalpha) and evaluated its potential to silence PKCalpha in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and in engineered heart tissues (EHTs), which resemble functional myocardium in vitro. A nonsense encoding AV (Ad-shNS) served as control. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting showed 90% lower PKCalpha-mRNA and 50% lower PKCalpha protein in Ad-shPKCalpha-infected cells. EHTs were infected with Ad-shPKCalpha on day 11 and subjected to isometric force measurements in organ baths 4 days later. Mean twitch tension was >50% higher in Ad-shPKCalpha compared to Ad-shNS-infected EHTs, under basal and Ca(2+)- or isoprenaline-stimulated conditions. Twitch tension negatively correlated with PKCalpha mRNA levels. In summary, AV-delivered shRNA mediated highly efficient PKCalpha knockdown in cardiac myocytes and improved contractility in EHTs. The data support a role of PKCalpha as a negative regulator of myocardial contractility and demonstrate that EHTs in conjunction with AV-delivered shRNA are a useful model for target validation.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2007-07-14", "authors": ["AliEl-Armouche", "JasminSingh", "HiroshiNaito", "KatrinWittk\u00f6pper", "MichaelDidi\u00e9", "AlexanderLaatsch", "Wolfram-HubertusZimmermann", "ThomasEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.05.021"}

During development of cardiac tissue, FGFR1 gene expression regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation. The focus of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation of the FGFR1 gene in proliferating neonatal cardiomyocytes. Analysis of DNA sequence of the FGFR1 gene identified three potential Sp factor binding sites located at 49 bp, 68 bp, and 100 bp upstream from the 3' end of the promoter segment. Mutation of each of these sites resulted in a significant decline in FGFR1 promoter activity compared to wild type promoter activity, and combinatorial mutation of all three sites completely abrogated promoter activity to background levels. In addition, overexpression of Sp1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in a dose-dependent increase in wild type FGFR1 promoter activity. However, Sp1-mediated up-regulation of promoter activity was abrogated when all three Sp interacting sites were mutated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to demonstrate direct interactions of Sp1 with the proximal promoter region of the FGFR1 gene in neonatal cardiomyocytes. ChIP assays using Drosophila Schneider Line 2 (SL2) cells transiently transfected with wild type or mutant FGFR1 promoter constructs verified the direct interaction between Sp1 and the three Sp1 interacting sites of the promoter.

Severe anaphylaxis in coronary heart disease, in particular, is explained by an increased load of cardiac mast cells together with coronary stenosis favouring myocardial hypoxia. Contraindications for the use of medications for cardiac disease in patients with anaphylaxis, especially beta-blockers, have been questioned by epidemiologic studies considering the positive effects of these drugs on much more prevalent cardiac diseases.\nPreexisting cardiovascular disease, mastocytosis and elevated baseline serum tryptase are risk factors for fatal anaphylactic reactions or lasting morbidity due to myocardial or cerebrovascular infarction induced by anaphylaxis.

To accomplish it, immediately preceding image acquisition, reversible, repeatable, acute nonpharmacological changes in preload were induced by parabolic flight. DTE has been proposed as a new approach to assess left ventricular regional myocardial function by computing tissue velocities, strain, and SR.

{"title": "The viral genetic background determines the outcome of coxsackievirus B3 infection in outbred NMRI mice.", "abstract": "The reasons for the different outcome of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced heart disease in humans are not well understood. Since there are no experimental data on the course of disease after infection with genetically different CVB3 in a natural variable population until now, we studied the outcome of virus infection in outbred NMRI mice after inoculation of genetically different CVB3 variants. Adult male mice were inoculated with seven closely related CVB3 variants. The histopathological changes of heart and pancreas tissue, antibody induction, virus titers, and persistence of viral positive- as well as negative-strand RNA in spleen and heart tissue were compared at day 7 or day 28 after infection to detect prerequisites and predictive factors for chronic myocarditis. Six CVB3 variants infected NMRI mice. CVB3 infection (i) did not induce detectable myocardial injury, (ii) caused signs of healing up acute myocarditis or (iii) ongoing chronic myocarditis. Neither IgG antibody responses nor the extent of destruction of exocrine pancreatic tissue or viral RNA load in spleen did correlate with myocardial histopathology. In contrast, a high persistent viral RNA load in heart tissue specimens was characteristic for mice developing chronic myocarditis. The results of the present study corroborate high viral load in the acute stage of myocarditis and high amounts of persisting CVB3 RNA in heart tissue as predictive marker of chronic myocarditis. The outcome of CVB3-induced heart disease in outbred NMRI mice depends strongly on the viral genetic background.

The objective of this study is to test for the association of polymorphisms related to cytokine genes with susceptibility and severity of RHD among affected children from the Nile Delta region of Egypt. The study included 50 children with chronic RHD (29 males and 21 females), with a mean age of 12.2 years, in addition to 98 healthy unrelated controls. Cases were further classified on the basis of echocardiographic findings into those with only mitral valve disease (MVD) or multivalvular lesions (MVLs) and also as mild, moderate, or severe valve lesions. For all cases and controls, DNA was extracted and amplified using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(-308 )G/A, interleukin (IL)-10(-1082 )G/A, and IL-6(-174 )G/C as well as a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in intron 2 of the IL-1Ra gene. All cases showed a significantly higher frequency of homozygous genotypes of TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A [odds ratio (OR) = 5.7, p < 0.001], IL-10(-1082) A/A (OR = 3.1, p < 0.05), IL-10(-1082) G/G (OR = 5.2, p < 0.05), and IL-1Ra A1/A1 (OR = 2.2, p < 0.05).

The equally important precursor of cardiac arrhythmias is the rotating spiral wave of electro-mechanical activity, or reentry, on the heart tissue. Here, we show that these two seemingly different phenomena can have a remarkable relationship. In well controlled in vitro tissue cultures, isotropic populations of rat ventricular myocytes sustaining a temporal rhythm of alternans can support period-2 oscillatory reentries and vice versa. These reentries bear \"line defects\" across which the phase of local excitation slips rather abruptly by 2pi, when a full period-2 cycle of alternans completes in 4pi. In other words, the cells belonging to the line defects are period-1 oscillatory, whereas all of the others in the bulk medium are period-2 oscillatory. We also find that a slowly rotating line defect results in a quasi-periodic like oscillation in the bulk medium.

Here we provide evidence that cardiac microRNAs, recently discovered key regulators of gene expression, contribute to the transcriptional changes observed in heart failure.\nCardiac transcriptome analyses revealed striking similarities between fetal and failing human heart tissue. Using microRNA arrays, we discovered profound alterations of microRNA expression in failing hearts. These changes closely mimicked the microRNA expression pattern observed in fetal cardiac tissue. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated a striking concordance between regulated messenger RNA expression in heart failure and the presence of microRNA binding sites in the respective 3' untranslated regions. Messenger RNAs upregulated in the failing heart contained preferentially binding sites for downregulated microRNAs and vice versa. Mechanistically, transfection of cardiomyocytes with a set of fetal microRNAs induced cellular hypertrophy as well as changes in gene expression comparable to the failing heart.\nOur data support a novel mode of regulation for the transcriptional changes in cardiac failure.

Thus, tissue engineering of functional cardiac patches critically depends on our understanding of the interaction between multiple guidance cues such as topographical, adhesive or electrical. The main objective of this study was to determine the interactive effects of contact guidance and electrical field stimulation on elongation and orientation of fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, major cell populations of the myocardium. Polyvinyl surfaces were abraded using lapping paper with grain size 1-80 microm, resulting in V-shaped abrasions with the average abrasion peak-to-peak width in the range from 3 to 13 microm, and the average depth in the range from 140 to 700 nm (AFM). The surfaces with abrasions 13 microm wide and 700 nm deep, exhibited the strongest effect on neonatal rat cardiomyocyte elongation and orientation as well as statistically significant effect on orientation of fibroblasts, thus they were utilized for electrical field stimulation. Electrical field stimulation was performed using a regime of relevance for heart tissue in vivo as well as for cardiac tissue engineering. Stimulation (square pulses, 1 ms duration, 1 Hz, 2.3 or 4.6 V/cm) was initiated 24 h after cell seeding and maintained for additional 72 h. The cover slips were positioned between the carbon rod electrodes such that the abrasions were either parallel or perpendicular to the field lines. Non-abraded surfaces were utilized as controls. Field stimulation did not affect cell viability. The presence of a well-developed contractile apparatus in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (staining for cardiac Troponin I and actin filaments) was identified in the groups cultivated on abraded surfaces in the presence of field stimulation. Overall we observed that (i) fibroblast and cardiomyocyte elongation on non-abraded surfaces was significantly enhanced by electrical field stimulation, (ii) electrical field stimulation promoted orientation of fibroblasts in the direction perpendicular to the field lines when the abrasions were also placed perpendicular to the field lines and (iii) topographical cues were a significantly stronger determinant of cardiomyocyte orientation than the electrical field stimulation. The orientation and elongation response of cardiomyocytes was completely abolished by inhibition of actin polymerization (Cytochalasin D) and only partially by inhibition of phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway (LY294002).", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2007-07-03", "authors": ["Hoi Ting HAu", "IreneCheng", "Mohammad FChowdhury", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.001"}
{"title": "Effects of zileuton on the development of autoimmune myocarditis in an experimental rat model.", "abstract": "Myocarditis is associated with high morbidity and mortality in childhood, but the pathogenesis of this disease is still unclear. Current knowledge indicates that complex immunopathogenic mechanisms are involved. It is understood that leukotrienes play an important role in the inflammation associated with asthma, and recent reports indicate that leukotrienes participate in immune processes and in autoimmunity.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the role of leukotriene synthesis in the development of myocardial inflammation and necrosis during myocarditis.\nThe effect of zileuton, a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, was assessed in an experimental model of autoimmune myocarditis in rats. Healthy adult (10-week-old) male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Groups A and B received injections of 1.0 mg porcine cardiac myosin to induce autoimmune myocarditis and group C (the control group) received phosphate-buffered saline. Group B also received zileuton by oral gavage at 100 mg/kg \u00b7 d(-1). Myocardial inflammation was assessed biochemically via serum concentrations of creatine kinase MB subunit (CK-MB) and troponin T. Cardiac tissue was assessed macroscopically (0 = no inflammation; 1 = a small discolored focus; 2 = diffuse discolored areas covering less than half of the cardiac surface; 3 = diffuse discolored areas covering more than half of the cardiac surface) and microscopically (0 = no inflammation; 1 = \u2aaf5% infiltration; 2 = 5% to <10% infiltration; 3 = 10% to < 20% infiltration; 4 = >20% infiltration).\nTwenty-four rats were divided equally into 3 groups. All rats survived the duration of the study. After 21 days, all rats were euthanized. No significant differences were found between groups A and B in terms of serum concentrations of CK-MB or troponin T. The microscopic pathology score was significantly lower in group B (myosin + zileuton) than in group A (myosin only) (0.12 [0.35] vs 1.25 [1.03]; P = 0.023). The microscopic pathology score was significantly higher in group A than in group C (1.25 [1.03] vs 0; P < 0.01), but the difference between groups B and C was not statistically significant. The macroscopic pathology score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (1.37 [0.91] vs 0.37 [0.51]; P = 0.029). The macroscopic pathology score was significantly higher in group A than in group C (1.37 [0.91] vs 0; P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in macroscopic scores between groups B and C (0.37 [0.51] vs 0).\nIn this study of the effects of zileuton in an experimental rat model of autoimmune myocarditis, no significant differences were found in the serum concentrations of the biochemical markers in the 2 groups administered myosin. However, lower macroscopic and microscopic inflammation scores in the zileuton-treated group (group B) compared with the group administered only myosin (group A) suggest that zileuton, a leukotriene-synthesis inhibitor, may suppress the development of experimental autoimmune myocarditis in rats.", "journal": "Current therapeutic research, clinical and experimental", "date": "2007-07-01", "authors": ["EnderOdemis", "SadiTurkay", "CemileKoca", "HalilKiyici", "AhmetKaradag", "ReyhanBayrak", "EminMete", "FerhatCatal", "RamazanYigitoglu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.curtheres.2007.08.002"}

{"title": "Preclinical cardiac safety assessment of drugs.", "abstract": "The heart is a frequent site of toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds in humans, and when developing a new drug it is critical to conduct a thorough preclinical evaluation of its possible adverse effects on cardiac structure and function. Changes in cardiac morphology such as myocardial necrosis, hypertrophy or valvulopathy are assessed in regulatory toxicity studies in laboratory animals, although specific models may be needed for a more accurate detection of the risk. The potential proarrhythmic risk of new drugs is a major subject of concern and needs to be fully addressed before treatment of volunteers or patients takes place. In vitro assays are conducted to determine the effects on cardiac ion channels, in particular I(Kr) potassium channel antagonism. Prolongation of the QT interval is assessed in vivo, generally in telemetered dogs. Together, these two tests are considered to detect most arrhythmic drugs. The results of this core battery can be refined by additional studies, in particular assays on isolated cardiac tissues determining changes in cardiac action potential duration, shape and variability over time. Triggering of arrhythmia is assessed in hypokalaemic dogs with artificially created bradycardia, or in vitro in isolated whole hearts. The proarrhythmic risk of the new compound is then evaluated by integrating the results of these different tests. Drug adverse effects on cardiac electrophysiological function, in particular impulse formation and conduction, are evaluated through changes in ECG, generally recorded in dogs, pigs or monkeys. Changes in cardiac contractility occurring either as a primary effect of the drug on cardiac function or as a consequence of cardiac lesions should also be carefully assessed. In telemetered or anaesthetised animals, cardiac contractility is evaluated by measurement of left ventricular pressure and its first derivative over time. Echocardiography allows non-invasive measurement of drug-induced changes in ventricular wall movements and cardiac haemodynamics indicative of effects on contractility. In conclusion, a reliable and accurate evaluation of the cardiac safety of a new pharmaceutical agent is based on the results of in vitro tests, with overall moderate to high throughput, and in vivo experiments assessing the effects of the drug on the heart in its physiological environment. The specific sensitivities of the animals used in these assays to cardiac adverse effects should also be considered.

Isolated male and female mouse hearts from WT and EC STAT3 knockout (STAT3KO) were subjected to 20-min ischemia/60-min reperfusion, and +/- dP/dt were continuously recorded. Heart tissue was analyzed for the active forms of STAT3 and p38 MAPK as well as expression of caspase-8 (Western blot) following I/R.

Nearly 25% of patients remain without a genetic diagnosis, and genes that encode cardiac channel regulatory proteins represent attractive candidates. Voltage-gated sodium channels have a pore-forming alpha-subunit associated with 1 or more auxiliary beta-subunits. Four different beta-subunits have been described. All are detectable in cardiac tissue, but none have yet been linked to any heritable arrhythmia syndrome.\nWe present a case of a 21-month-old Mexican-mestizo female with intermittent 2:1 atrioventricular block and a corrected QT interval of 712 ms. Comprehensive open reading frame/splice mutational analysis of the 9 established LQTS-susceptibility genes proved negative, and complete mutational analysis of the 4 Na(vbeta)-subunits revealed a L179F (C535T) missense mutation in SCN4B that cosegregated properly throughout a 3-generation pedigree and was absent in 800 reference alleles. After this discovery, SCN4B was analyzed in 262 genotype-negative LQTS patients (96% white), but no further mutations were found. L179F was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells that contained the stably expressed SCN5A-encoded sodium channel alpha-subunit (hNa(V)1.5). Compared with the wild-type, L179F-beta4 caused an 8-fold (compared with SCN5A alone) and 3-fold (compared with SCN5A + WT-beta4) increase in late sodium current consistent with the molecular/electrophysiological phenotype previously shown for LQTS-associated mutations.\nWe provide the seminal report of SCN4B-encoded Na(vbeta)4 as a novel LQT3-susceptibility gene.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2007-06-27", "authors": ["ArgeliaMedeiros-Domingo", "ToshihikoKaku", "David JTester", "PedroIturralde-Torres", "AjitItty", "BinYe", "CarmenValdivia", "KazuoUeda", "SamuelCanizales-Quinteros", "Maria TeresaTusi\u00e9-Luna", "Jonathan CMakielski", "Michael JAckerman"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.659086"}
{"title": "Extracellular matrix, mechanotransduction and structural hierarchies in heart tissue engineering.", "abstract": "The spatial and temporal scales of cardiac organogenesis and pathogenesis make engineering of artificial heart tissue a daunting challenge. The temporal scales range from nanosecond conformational changes responsible for ion channel opening to fibrillation which occurs over seconds and can lead to death. Spatial scales range from nanometre pore sizes in membrane channels and gap junctions to the metre length scale of the whole cardiovascular system in a living patient. Synchrony over these scales requires a hierarchy of control mechanisms that are governed by a single common principle: integration of structure and function. To ensure that the function of ion channels and contraction of muscle cells lead to changes in heart chamber volume, an elegant choreography of metabolic, electrical and mechanical events are executed by protein networks composed of extracellular matrix, transmembrane integrin receptors and cytoskeleton which are functionally connected across all size scales. These structural control networks are mechanoresponsive, and they process mechanical and chemical signals in a massively parallel fashion, while also serving as a bidirectional circuit for information flow. This review explores how these hierarchical structural networks regulate the form and function of living cells and tissues, as well as how microfabrication techniques can be used to probe this structural control mechanism that maintains metabolic supply, electrical activation and mechanical pumping of heart muscle. Through this process, we delineate various design principles that may be useful for engineering artificial heart tissue in the future.", "journal": "Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

{"title": "Vascular Angiotensin type 1 receptor expression is associated with vascular dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation in fructose-fed rats.", "abstract": "This study determined whether or not oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in fructose-induced hyperinsulinemic rats are associated with activation of the vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Four groups of rats were used. CONT rats were fed normal rat chow, CONT+CAP were fed normal rat chow and given 500 mg/L captopril in their drinking water, fructose-fed rats (FFR) were fed a high-fructose diet and FFR+CAP were fed the high-fructose diet plus captopril in water. After 8 weeks, the vascular reactivity of mesenteric artery segments was measured. Blood was analyzed for insulin, glucose, hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane. Aortic and heart tissue were used for subjected to quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in FFR (p<0.05), and captopril treatment inhibited the blood pressure increase. Mesenteric artery dose-response curves to acetylcholine were shifted to the right in FFR (p<0.05) and were normal in FFR+CAP. Plasma insulin (p<0.05), hydrogen peroxide (p<0.02) and 8-isoprostane (p<0.05) were increased in FFR. Captopril treatment reducd hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane concentrations. Aortic tissue mRNA expression levels were increased for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, p<0.05), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R, p<0.02), NOX4 (p<0.02) and VCAM-1 (p<0.05) in FFR aortic samples. Captopril treatment reduced AT1R, NOX4 and VCAM-1 expression in FFR to levels not different from CONT. Similar changes in heart tissue mRNA expression for angiotensinogen, AT1R and NOX4 were also observed. These results demonstrate that vascular RAS is upregulated in FFR and support the hypothesis that vascular RAS mediates vascular dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress in FFR.", "journal": "Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension", "date": "2007-06-26", "authors": ["Michael DNyby", "KarolinAbedi", "VictoriaSmutko", "PiroozEslami", "Michael LTuck"], "doi": "10.1291/hypres.30.451"}
{"title": "Simulations of propagated mouse ventricular action potentials: effects of molecular heterogeneity.", "abstract": "The molecular heterogeneity of repolarizing currents produces significant spatial heterogeneity and/or dispersion of repolarization in many mammalian cardiac tissues. Transgenic mice are prominent experimental models for the study of the molecular basis of repolarization and arrhythmias. However, it is debated whether the small mouse heart can sustain physiologically relevant heterogeneity of repolarization. We used a comprehensive model of the mouse action potential (AP) to predict how small a region of the cardiac tissue can maintain spatial gradients of repolarization due to differential expression of channels. Our simulations of a one-dimensional multicellular ring or cable predict that substantial gradients in repolarization and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration transients can be maintained through heterogeneity of expression of K(+) channels in distances of approximately 10 cells that are sufficient to block propagation. The abruptness of expression gradients and the site of stimulation can cause Ca(2+) transient oscillations and affect the stability of Ca(2+) dynamics and AP propagation. Two different mechanisms of instability of AP propagation in one-dimensional cable occur at fast pacing rates. Transitions from periodic activity to alternans or to irregular behavior were observed. Abrupt gradients of channel expression can cause alternans at slower pacing rates than gradual changes. Our simulations demonstrate the importance of incorporating realistic Ca(2+) dynamics and current densities into models of propagated AP. They also emphasize that microscopic aspects of tissue organization are important for predicting large-scale propagation phenomena. Finally, our results predict that the mouse heart should be able to sustain substantial molecularly based heterogeneity of repolarization.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Gender specific effect of progesterone on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.", "abstract": "The study was designed to investigate the effect of progesterone and its gender based variation on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were divided into vehicle treated reperfusion injury group male (I/R-M), female (I/R-F), ovariectomised (I/R-OVR) and progesterone treatment (I/R-M+PG, I/R-F+PG, I/R-OVR+PG) groups, respectively. I/R injury was produced by occluding the left descending coronary artery (LCA) for 1 h and followed by re-opening for 1 h. Progesterone (2 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was administered 30 min after induction of ischemia. Hemodynamic parameters (+/-dp/dt, MAP), heart rate, ST-segment elevation and occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were measured during the I/R period. The myocardial infarct area, oxidative stress markers, activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and creatine kinase (CK) were determined after the experiment along with the assessment of the effect on apoptotic activity by using DNA fragmentation analysis. Histological observations were carried out on heart tissue. Treatment with progesterone significantly (P<0.05) reduced infarct area, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level and activity of MPO in females (I/R-F+PG) as compared to ischemic females (I/R-F). Progesterone significantly (P<0.001, P<0.05) inhibited serum CK activity and incidences of VT in female rats. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly elevated (P<0.05) in I/R-F+PG group. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was less in I/R-F+PG group when compared to I/R-F group. The ischemic male and ovariectomised (I/R-M and I/R-OVR) counterparts did not show any significant change after progesterone treatment. In conclusion, the cardioprotective effect of progesterone on myocardial I/R injury induced damage is based on gender of the animal. The protective effect could be mediated by attenuation of inflammation and its possible interaction with endogenous estrogen.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2007-06-26", "authors": ["Vipin VDhote", "RBalaraman"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2007.05.010"}

{"title": "Towards automation of a valuable preclinical cardiac safety pharmacology assay: Evaluation of the effects of cardiac ion channel blockers on cardiac repolarisation in vitro.", "abstract": "Purkinje fibre repolarisation assays are valuable tools for identifying compounds which affect cardiac ion channels. The throughput of compound testing in this assay is low therefore we designed a novel recording system to improve screening and animal tissue usage efficiencies.\nThe system was used to evaluate compounds using standard sharp microelectrode techniques. Animal tissue usage efficiencies were quantified by adding up the total number of Purkinje fibres from which recordings were attempted and dividing this by the number of experimental data sets generated, to arrive at a 'fibres per data set' ratio. Test compounds were dofetilide (3 x 10(-10) to 10(-8) M), cisapride (10(-8) to 3 x 10(-7) M), terodiline (10(-6) to 3 x 10(-5) M) and verapamil (3 x 10(-7) to 10(-5) M).\nUsing the novel modified system, 21 data sets were generated from 29 fibres, compared to 24 data sets from 41 fibres using the conventional manual recording system, demonstrating a 24% improvement in the efficiency of animal tissue usage.

Using the guanidinium thyocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, we extracted total RNA from samples obtained from heart of mouse and from the atrium, ventricle, and septum of normal pigs.

Sus Scrofa natriuretic peptide receptor 2 mRNA, 1-396 bp, was submitted to GenBank (accession number DQ487044). The presence of NPR-B at mRNA level was detected in all the cardiac chambers; moreover, the bands obtained from pig cardiac tissue shared a 93% sequence homology with a region of the mouse NPR-B and a 95% sequence homology with Homo sapiens.

Macropatch recordings from these regions were used to study the effects of HF on brain-type Na(+) current. Neither current density nor gating properties (activation, inactivation, recovery from inactivation, slow inactivation) differed between CTR and HF.\nThe density and gating properties of brain-type Na(+) current are not altered in our HF model.

Understanding the pathways and mechanisms contributing to this in vitro tissuegenesis is a critical goal of tissue engineering. To identify pathways relevant to cardiac tissue engineering, we compared mRNA expression profiles from bioreactor-cultured 3D aggregates of primary neonatal rat heart cells (NRHCs), which form layered structures similar to cardiac tissue, and standard plate-cultured NRHCs, which do not. In a series of two experiments, NRHCs were grown on solid microcarrier surfaces within clinostatically rotated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vessels and compared to parallel cultures grown on standard tissue culture plates without rotation. After 1, 4, and 6 days, gene expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A (RG-U34A) arrays. The results were validated using real-time PCR, and the data set was filtered to generate a list of 93 probe sets that were substantially the same in replicate samples but substantially different between the bioreactor and plate groups. Cluster analysis indicated that the bioreactor and plate samples had similar expression patterns on day 1 but that these patterns diverged thereafter. Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) analysis revealed a number of statistically significant gene groupings, including groups associated with muscle development and morphogenesis. Further analysis of the annotated gene list indicated that 13 of the 93 filtered genes were associated with endothelial cells, blood vessels, or angiogenesis.

{"title": "Cathodal stimulation in the recovery phase of a propagating planar wave in the rabbit heart reveals four stimulation mechanisms.", "abstract": "The stimulation of cardiac tissue in the recovery phase has significant importance in relation to reentry induction. In the theoretical experiment proposed by Winfree, termed the 'pinwheel' experiment, a point stimulus (S2) is applied in the wake of a freely propagating planar wave (S1). Reentry induced from this S1-S2 pinwheel protocol has been observed experimentally in heart preparations. However, in these experiments, which focused on activation outcomes, only mapping of extracellular voltages has been conducted. The lack of transmembrane potential (Vm) distribution data makes it impossible to analyse the underlying stimulation mechanisms which precede the reentry induction. In this work we sought to elucidate the stimulation mechanisms throughout the heart cycle using the pinwheel protocol. We examined the cardiac tissue responses during and immediately after cathodal stimulation in the refractory wake of a propagating planar wave. The voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS was utilized to measure Vm directly from quasi two-dimensional preparations of cryoablated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Four stimulation mechanisms were observed that depended on the Vm magnitude during S2 cathodal stimulation. Make stimulation always occurred during diastolic stimulation. When stimulation was at the beginning of the relative refractory period (RRP), transitional make-break stimulation was detected. During the RRP the excitation was due to the break mechanism. While approaching the effective refractory period (ERP), the tissue response is characterized by a damped wave mediated response. These four stimulation mechanisms were observed in all hearts whether the S1 planar wave propagation was parallel or perpendicular to the fibre direction. This study is the first examination of Vm and the stimulation mechanisms throughout the cardiac cycle using the pinwheel protocol, and the results have implications in the development and improvement of pacing protocols for artificial cardiostimulators.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2007-06-16", "authors": ["Veniamin YSidorov", "Marcella CWoods", "FranzBaudenbacher"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2007.137232"}

However, it suffers limitations associated with cell retention, survival and differentiation. In addition, the results from preclinical and clinical studies based on such treatments have generated mixed results.

{"title": "The vicissitudes of the pacemaker current I (Kdd) of cardiac purkinje fibers.", "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the pacemaker current in cardiac tissues is not agreed upon. The pacemaker potential in Purkinje fibers has been attributed to the decay of the potassium current I (Kdd). An alternative proposal is that the hyperpolarization-activated current I (f) underlies the pacemaker potential in all cardiac pacemakers. The aim of this review is to retrace the experimental development related to the pacemaker mechanism in Purkinje fibers with reference to findings about the pacemaker mechanism in the SAN as warranted. Experimental data and their interpretation are critically reviewed. Major findings were attributed to K(+) depletion in narrow extracellular spaces which would result in a time dependent decay of the inward rectifier current I (K1). In turn, this decay would be responsible for a \"fake\" reversal of the pacemaker current. In order to avoid such a postulated depletion, Ba(2+) was used to block the decay of I (K1). In the presence of Ba(2+) the time-dependent current no longer reversed and instead increased with time and more so at potentials as negative as -120 mV. In this regard, the distinct possibility needs to be considered that Ba(2+) had blocked I (Kdd) (and not only I (K1)). That indeed this was the case was demonstrated by studying single Purkinje cells in the absence and in the presence of Ba(2+). In the absence of Ba(2+), I (Kdd) was present in the pacemaker potential range and reversed at E (K). In the presence of Ba(2+), I (Kdd) was blocked and I (f) appeared at potentials negative to the pacemaker range. The pacemaker potential behaves in a manner consistent with the underlying I (Kdd) but not with I (f). The fact that I (f) is activated on hyperpolarization at potential negative to the pacemaker range makes it suitable as a safety factor to prevent the inhibitory action of more negative potentials on pacemaker discharge. It is concluded that the large body of evidence reviewed proves the pacemaker role of I (Kdd) (but not of I (f)) in Purkinje fibers.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical science", "date": "2007-06-15", "authors": ["MarioVassalle"], "doi": "10.1007/s11373-007-9182-2"}

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) has been implicated in drug addiction, but its role in activation of the heart during morphine dependence remains poorly understood. Here, we have looked for activation of ERK during morphine withdrawal and if this activation induced gene expression.\nDependence on morphine was induced by s.c. implantation of morphine pellets for 7 days.

ERK1/2, their phosphorylated forms and c-Fos were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry of cardiac tissue.\nNaloxone-induced morphine withdrawal activated ERK1/2 and increased c-Fos expression in cardiac tissues. c-Fos expression was blocked by SL327, a drug that prevents ERK activation.\nThese results indicate that signalling through the ERKs is necessary for morphine withdrawal-induced hyperactivity of the heart and suggest that this pathway may also be involved in activation of immediate-early genes in both cytosolic and nuclear effector mechanisms that have the potential to bring about long-term changes in the heart.", "journal": "British journal of pharmacology", "date": "2007-06-06", "authors": ["PAlmela", "M VMilan\u00e9s", "M LLaorden"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.bjp.0707301"}
{"title": "C5a-blockade improves burn-induced cardiac dysfunction.", "abstract": "We previously reported that generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a is linked to the development of cardiac dysfunction in sepsis due to C5a interaction with its receptor (C5aR) on cardiomyocytes. Burn injury involves inflammatory mechanisms that can lead to C5a generation as well. In this study, we investigated the effects of C5a blockade on burn-induced cardiac dysfunction. Using a standardized rat model of full thickness scald injury, left ventricular pressures were recorded in vivo followed by in vitro assessment of sarcomere contraction of single cardiomyocytes. Left ventricular pressures in vivo and cardiomyocyte sarcomere contractility in vitro were significantly reduced following burn injury. In the presence of anti-C5a Ab, these defects were greatly attenuated 1, 6, and 12 h after burn injury and completely abolished 24 h after burn. In vitro incubation of cardiomyocytes with bacterial LPS accentuated the impaired contractility, which was partially prevented in cardiomyocytes from burned rats that had received an anti-C5a Ab. Based on Western blot analyses, real-time PCR, and immunostaining of left ventricular heart tissue, there was a significant increase in cardiomyocyte expression of C5aR after burn injury. In conclusion, an in vivo blockade of C5a attenuates burn-induced cardiac dysfunction. Further deterioration of contractility due to the exposure of cardiomyocytes to LPS was partially prevented by C5a-blockade. These results suggest a linkage between C5a and burn-induced cardiac dysfunction and a possible contribution of LPS to these events.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2007-06-06", "authors": ["Laszlo MHoesel", "Andreas DNiederbichler", "JuliaSchaefer", "Kyros RIpaktchi", "HongweiGao", "DanielRittirsch", "Matthew JPianko", "Peter MVogt", "J VidyaSarma", "Grace LSu", "SamanArbabi", "Margaret VWestfall", "Stewart CWang", "Mark RHemmila", "Peter AWard"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.178.12.7902"}

{"title": "Cardioprotection in stunned and hibernating myocardium.", "abstract": "Although myocardial ischemia was once thought to result in irreversible cellular damage, it is now demonstrated that in cardiac tissue, submitted to the stress of oxygen and substrate deprivation, endogenous mechanisms of cell survival may be activated. These molecular mechanisms result in physiological conditions of adaptation to ischemia, known as myocardial stunning and hibernation. These conditions result from a switch in gene and protein expression, which sustains cardiac cell survival in a context of oxygen deprivation and during the stress of reperfusion. The pattern of cell survival elicited by ischemia in myocardial stunning or hibernation results in the activation of cytoprotective mechanisms that will protect the heart against further ischemic damage, a condition referred to as ischemic preconditioning. The basic mechanisms underlying stunning and hibernation are still a matter of intense research, which includes the discovery and characterization of novel survival genes not described in the heart before, or the unraveling of new cellular processes, such as autophagy. Understanding how the molecular adaptation of the cardiac myocyte during stress sustains its survival in these conditions therefore might help defining novel mechanisms of endogenous myocardial salvage, in order to expand the conditions of maintained cellular viability and functional salvage of the ischemic myocardium.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2007-06-02", "authors": ["ChristopheDepre", "Stephen FVatner"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-007-9040-3"}

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) delta is a nuclear receptor abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes and plays a pivotal role in maintaining constitutive mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO). Recently, a novel signaling pathway of PGI2 via PPARdelta has been demonstrated in non-cardiac tissues. We therefore examined whether carbacyclin (cPGI2), a PGI2 analogue, up-regulates transcriptional expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial FAO, via PPARdelta in cardiomyocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of cPGI2 increased CPT-1 mRNA expression in murine hearts. Transcriptional activity was evaluated by PPAR responsive element (PPRE)-luciferase reporter gene assay in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. CPT-1 mRNA expression and PPRE promoter activity were significantly increased by cPGI2 in a concentration-dependent manner, where PPRE has been mapped to the promoter region of the CPT-1 gene. Moreover, the elevation of CPT-1 mRNA expression and PPRE promoter activity by cPGI2 was not abolished by H-89, a potent protein kinase A inhibitor, but was significantly inhibited in cardiomyocytes over-expressing a dominant-negative type of PPARdelta. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of PPARdelta to PPRE in the CPT-1 gene promoter is enhanced in response to cPGI2 stimulation. In addition, down-regulation of CPT-1 mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia was attenuated by cPGI2. These results indicate that cPGI2 induces CPT-1 mRNA expression through PPARdelta, independent of the IP receptor signaling pathway, suggesting a possibility that cPGI2 modulates cardiac energy metabolism by activating FAO via PPARdelta.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2007-06-02", "authors": ["TadashiKuroda", "HisaoHirota", "YasushiFujio", "ShokoSugiyama", "MitsuruMasaki", "YoshimuneHiramoto", "WataruShioyama", "KitaroOkamoto", "MasatsuguHori", "KeikoYamauchi-Takihara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2007.04.003"}

The temporal uptake of the labeled fusion protein of C2A and glutathione-s-transferase (C2A-GST) in the area at risk was investigated by intravenously injecting the radiotracer at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after reperfusion, and the radioactivity uptake was quantified by gamma-counting of infarcted and ischemic noninfarcted cardiac tissues. Alternatively, the radiotracer was injected at 2 h after reperfusion, and the uptake was measured at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after injection. In vivo planar imaging was performed on a gamma-camera using a parallel-hole collimator. The distribution of radioactivity was qualitatively examined by autoradiography. The relationship between the uptake of the radiotracer in the area at risk and the ischemic duration was examined by gamma-counting.\nTemporally, the radioactivity uptake in the area at risk maximized when the radiotracer was injected before 3 h after reperfusion. Injections at 6 and 24 h after reperfusion resulted in a 30% and 50% reduction in uptake, respectively. However, when the injection was done early (2 h after reperfusion), the tracer was retained in the area at risk with little washout for at least 24 h. Spatially prominent hot-spot uptake was seen in all cases of planar imaging. In autoradiography, the distribution of radioactivity predominantly coregistered with the infarcted regions. This distribution profile was confirmed by direct gamma-counting.

Typical cell delivery techniques, however, suffer from poor cell engraftment and inhomogeneous cell distributions. Therefore, we assessed the hypothesis that an epicardially applied, tissue-engineered cardiac patch containing progenitor cells would result in enhanced exogenous cell engraftment. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were embedded into a rat tail type I collagen matrix to form the cardiac patch. Myocardial infarction was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in immunocompetent male cesarean-derived fischer rats, and patches with or without cells were secured to hearts with fibrin sealant. After patch formation, hMSCs retained a viability of >90% over 5 days in culture. In addition, >75% of hMSCs maintained a high degree of potency prior to patch implantation. After 4 days in culture, patches were applied to the epicardial surface of the infarct area and resulted in 23% +/- 4% engraftment of hMSCs at 1 week (n = 6). Patch application resulted in a reduction in left ventricle interior diameter at systole, increased anterior wall thickness, and a 30% increase in fractional shortening. Despite this improvement in myocardial remodeling, hMSCs were not detectable at 4 weeks after patch application, implying that improvement did not require long-term cell engraftment. Patches devoid of progenitor cells showed no improvement in remodeling. In conclusion, pluripotent hMSCs can be efficiently delivered to a site of myocardial injury using an epicardial cardiac patch, and such delivery results in improved myocardial remodeling after infarction.

The profile of adenine nucleotide content in the heart tissue did not differ between leghorns and Broilers-Res, but there were significant differences among Broilers-Res, Broilers-AL, and broilers with ascites.

ATP:ADP and ATP:CrP ratios increased with age in both leghorn and Broilers-Res, declined in fast growing broilers, and were the lowest in broilers that developed heart failure. The changes in heart high energy phosphate profile in broilers suggest that the energy demand of the heart during a rapid growth phase may exceed the bird's metabolic capacity to supply adequate levels of high energy phosphate substrate.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of serum deprivation and hypoxia on the MSC survival rates in vitro. As expanded MSCs are transferred from plastic to a scaffold in most tissue engineering approaches, possibly inducing loss of survival signals from matrix attachments, the effects of a scaffold shift on the MSC survival rates were also assessed. Human MSCs were exposed for 48 hours to (i) a scaffold substrate shift, (ii) serum deprivation, and (iii) O2 deprivation. MSCs were also exposed to prolonged (up to 120 hours) hypoxia associated with serum deprivation. Cell death was assessed by Live/Dead staining and image analysis. The MSC death rates were not affected by the shift to scaffold or 48-hour hypoxia, but increased with fetal bovine serum (FBS) starvation, suggesting that between the two components of ischemia, nutrient deprivation is the stronger factor. Long-term hypoxia combined with serum deprivation resulted in the complete death of MSCs (99 +/- 1%), but this rate was reduced by half when MSCs were exposed to hypoxia in the presence of 10% FBS (51 +/- 31%).

Activation of ERK1/2 was attained under physiological shear stress conditions, without activating the p38 cell death signal above its basic level. Activation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade induced synthesis of high levels of contractile and cell-cell contact proteins by the cardiomyocytes, while its inhibition diminished the inducing effects of pulsatile flow.

{"title": "Evalution of toxicity of abcisic acid and gibberellic acid in rats: 50 days drinking water study.", "abstract": "In the present study, the influence of subchronic effects of two plant growth regulators (PGRs) [Abcisic acid (ABA) and Gibberellic acid (GA3)] on antioxidant defense systems [reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT)] and lipid peroxidation level (malondialdehyde = MDA) in various tissues of the rat were investigated during treatment as a drinking water model. 75 ppm of ABA and GA3 in drinking water were continuously administered orally to rats (Sprague-Dawley albino) ad libitum for 50 days. The PGRs treatments caused different effects on the antioxidant defense systems and MDA content of dosed rats compared to controls. The lipid peroxidation end product MDA significantly increased in the lungs, heart and kidney of rats treated with GA3 without significant change in the spleen. ABA caused also a significant increase in MDA content in the spleen, lungs, heart and kidney. The GSH levels were significantly depleted in the spleen, lungs and stomach of rats treated with ABA without any change in the tissues of rats treated with GA3 except the kidney where it increased. Antioxidant enzyme activities such as SOD significantly increased in the lungs and stomach and decreased in the spleen and heart tissues of rats treated with GA3. Meanwhile, SOD significantly decreased in the spleen, heart and kidney and increased in the lungs of rats treated with ABA. While CAT activity significantly decreased in the lungs of rats treated with GA3, a significant increase occurred in the heart of rats treated with both PGRs. On the other hand, the ancillary enzyme GR activity in the tissues were either significantly depleted or not changed with PGRs treatment. The drug metabolizing enzyme GST activity significantly decreased in the lungs of rats treated with ABA but increased in the stomach of rats treated with both PGRs. As a conclusion, the rats resisted oxidative stress via the antioxidant mechanism. But the antioxidant mechanism could not prevent the increases in lipid peroxidation in rat's tissues. This data, along with changes, suggests that PGRs produced substantial systemic organ toxicity in the spleen, lungs, stomach, heart and kidney during a 50-day period of subchronic exposure.", "journal": "Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry", "date": "2007-05-24", "authors": ["IsmailCelik", "YasinTuluce", "IsmailIsik"], "doi": "10.1080/14756360600988955"}

Recently, several histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) including phenylbutyrate (PBA) have shown promise in the treatment of cancer with little known toxicity to normal tissues. PBA has been shown to protect against oxidative stress in normal tissues. Here, we examined whether PBA might protect heart against ADR toxicity in a mouse model. The mice were i.p. injected with ADR (20 mg/kg). PBA (400 mg/kg/day) was i.p. injected 1 day before and daily after the ADR injection for 2 days. We found that PBA significantly decreased the ADR-associated elevation of serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities and diminished ADR-induced ultrastructural damages of cardiac tissue by more than 70%. Importantly, PBA completely rescued ADR-caused reduction of cardiac functions exemplified by ejection fraction and fraction shortening, and increased cardiac manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protein and activity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role of HDACIs in protecting against ADR-induced cardiac injury and suggest that PBA may exert its cardioprotective effect, in part, by the increase of MnSOD.

Underlying pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for myocardial disease in HIV-infection remain imperfectly understood. SIV-infected rhesus monkeys develop a spectrum of cardiac lesions similar to those seen in HIV-infected people, providing an important model for pathogenesis studies. Retrospective analysis of cardiac tissue collected at necropsy from SIV-infected rhesus monkeys was performed to evaluate myocardial macrophage and dendritic cell populations as a function of previously quantitated lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates and cardiomyocyte degeneration or necrosis. Variations in the size and phenotype of macrophage and dendritic cell populations were examined as possible contributors to the pathogenesis of SIV-associated inflammatory lesions. Macrophages labeling immunohistochemically for CD163 differed substantially from macrophages labeling for HAM56 in overall number, distribution across groups, involvement in inflammatory clusters, correlation with the DC-SIGN(+) subpopulation of macrophages, and correlation with numbers of SIV-infected cells. CD163(+) macrophages occurred in significantly higher numbers in uninflamed hearts from SIV-infected animals than in hearts from SIV-infected animals with myocarditis or uninfected controls (p < 0.01). Numbers of CD163(+) cells correlated positively with numbers of SIV-infected cells (p < 0.05) suggesting that the CD163(+) population was associated with decreased inflammatory infiltration and reduced control of virus within the heart.

Our results show that (1) type II alveolar cells of lungs in SO2-exposure groups had obvious pathological changes including vacuolation of osmiophilic multilamellar bodies, a decrease in microvilli content and mitochondrial pyknosis or swelling, as well as various changes in the structure of the nucleus and chromatin. Meanwhile obvious changes in the mitochondrial and nuclear compartments, in type II alveolar cells were also observed.

Angiotensin II and aldosterone (corticosterone in rodents) together generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, which likely facilitate this hypertrophy and remodeling. This investigation sought to determine whether cardiac oxidative stress and cellular remodeling could be attenuated by in vivo mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade in a rodent model of the chronically elevated tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the transgenic TG (mRen2) 27 rat (Ren2). The Ren2 overexpresses the mouse renin transgene with resultant hypertension, insulin resistance, proteinuria, and cardiovascular damage.

Until recently, there was no effective therapy available for this disease. The present study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa on the cardiac manifestations of Anderson-Fabry disease.\nThe effects of therapy with agalsidase alfa on cardiac structure and function were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 15 adult male patients with Anderson-Fabry disease. The following parameters were measured at baseline and 6 months: left ventricular mass, QRS duration and levels of Gb(3) in cardiac tissue, urine sediment and plasma. After 6 months of the randomised trial patients were enrolled in a 2-year open-label extension study.\nLeft ventricular mass, as measured by MRI, was significantly reduced following 6 months of treatment with agalsidase alfa compared with placebo (p = 0.041). A mean 20% reduction in myocardial Gb(3) content as assessed by serial transvenous endomyocardial biopsies was demonstrated over the 6 months of enzyme replacement compared to a mean 10% increase in patients receiving placebo (p = 0.42)\nEnzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa resulted in regression of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Anderson-Fabry disease.", "journal": "Heart (British Cardiac Society)", "date": "2007-05-08", "authors": ["D AHughes", "P MElliott", "JShah", "JZuckerman", "GCoghlan", "JBrookes", "A BMehta"], "doi": "10.1136/hrt.2006.104026"}

Both concepts have been successfully demonstrated by several groups using immature primary heart cells, but these cells are essentially postmitotic, precluding clinical and large-scale in vitro applications. Identification of a renewable cell source is therefore one of the key objectives in the field. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are attractive candidates because they can be propagated in large quantities, have a robust capacity to differentiate into cardiac myocytes, and can be obtained from humans. Classic isolation of ES cells from the inner cell mass is associated with destruction of the respective embryo.

To ascertain the role of the cardiovascular actions of GLP-1 in health and disease states necessitates a review of the current evidence as well as ongoing investigation. Of cardiovascular significance, both positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, unmodifiable by beta-adrenergic blockers, have been reportedly attributed to GLP-1 actions on the myocardium. However, the potent role of GLP-1 and its analogues in eliciting tachycardic and pressor effects should be of some concern. Aside from its reported insulinotropic activity, GLP-1 impacts the myocardium directly. Highly specific GLP-1 receptors have been identified in the heart and within the central nervous system, particularly in the nucleus tractus solitarius, a neuromodulatory centre of cardiovascular control. The occurrence of GLP-1 receptors in cardiac tissue and autonomic regions of cardiovascular control has stimulated investigation, particularly as these sites may be suitable targets for the pharmacological action of GLP-1 and long-acting analogues.

In this study, we report the cloning of two cDNA splice variants of PDE1: PDE1-small and PDE1-large, from bovine cardiac tissue. Their amino acid sequence similarity to PDE1 sequences from other mammalian species showed that all are very conserved, suggesting their importance in cellular functions. Interestingly, compared to other mammalian species, bovine PDE1A, PDE-small and PDE-large show a deletion at the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain of the gene. Although the significance of this deletion at this crucial location of the gene is not known, we have successfully over-expressed both PDE1-small and PDE1-large splice variants in E. coli and these splice variants are characterized in terms of Western blot, biotinylated calmodulin overlay and peptide mass fingerprinting. Results from these studies suggested that these two splice variants belong to the PDE1 superfamily.

A major constituent of bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Recent analysis of the cellular effects of UDCA and its taurine conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) have demonstrated their antiapoptotic properties through regulation of Bcl-2 family and survival signaling proteins (Bax, Bad, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TUDCA administered to rats prior to a myocardial infarction (MI) would exhibit anti-apoptotic effects and improve cardiac function. Prior to ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, TUDCA (50 mg/ml, 400 mg/kg, IV) or PBS was administered to rats. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after ligation for terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activity to assess apoptosis. Additional TUDCA or PBS treated rats underwent pre-operative,1 and 4 week transthoracic ultrasounds to assess heart function by quantification of shortening fraction (SF) and infarct area. TUNEL labeling of the cardiac tissue revealed a significant reduction in apoptotic cells in rats given TUDCA prior to ischemic injury (p = 0.05). In support of reducing apoptosis, caspase-3 activity in the TUDCA treated animals also decreased (p = 0.02). By 4 weeks, a significantly smaller infarct area was present in the TUDCA group compared to the PBS group (0.05 vs. 0.13 cm(2), p = NS) and there was also an improvement in SF. The results provide evidence for TUDCA as a viable treatment for reducing apoptosis in a model of myocardial infarction. Additional studies will distinguish the functional result of improved cell survival following infarction, suggesting the potential for clinical application of this anti-apoptotic drug in treatment of acute MI.", "journal": "The American journal of Chinese medicine", "date": "2007-04-17", "authors": ["Andrew LRivard", "Clifford JSteer", "Betsy TKren", "Cecilia M PRodrigues", "Rui ECastro", "Richard WBianco", "Walter CLow"], "doi": "10.1142/S0192415X07004813"}
{"title": "Metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in poultry: role of dietary lipids.", "abstract": "In the United States, supplemental dietary lipid is typically provided as an animal-vegetable blend using animal tallow or hydrogenated oils from the food industry. Lipids from these sources are rich in saturated, trans, n-6 fatty acids and poor in n-3 fatty acids. Linoleic (18:2 n-6) and alpha-linolenic (18:3 n-3) acids are essential fatty acids and are the precursors of long-chain n-6 and n-3 fatty acids such as arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA). Ester-linked arachidonic acid and EPA can be mobilized by phospholipase A(2) to generate free arachidonic acid and EPA, which can act as substrates for cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase to produce eicosanoids. Eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid, prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, and leukotriene B4 are proinflammatory and more potent than eicosanoids derived from EPA such as prostaglandin E3, thromboxane B3, and leukotriene B5. Developing dietary strategies in broiler chickens that enhance the n-3 fatty acid content of tissues is also associated with lipid oxidation and muscle product quality. Therefore, alternative strategies for enhancing tissue n-3 fatty acid content without affecting growth and product quality must be devised. The role of maternal (yolk) fatty acids in modulating the long-chain n-3 fatty acid content of tissues and eicosanoid production in chickens fed a diet lacking in long-chain n-3 fatty acids is investigated. Up to d 42 of growth, the cardiac tissues of chicks hatched from hens fed a high n-3 diet retained higher levels of long-chain n-3 fatty acids than those of chicks hatched from hens fed a low n-3 diet. Chicks hatched from hens fed a high n-3 diet produced less proinflammatory eicosanoids than chicks hatched from hens fed a low n-3 diet. Modulating maternal dietary n-3 fatty acids enhances tissue retention of n-3 fatty acids during growth and reduces proinflammatory eicosanoid production in chicks, which could lead to fewer metabolic and inflammatory-related disorders in poultry.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2007-04-17", "authors": ["GCherian"], "doi": "10.1093/ps/86.5.1012"}

Broilers were divided into 5 groups and fed a Mn-unsupplemented basal diet (control) or the basal diet supplemented with 120 mg of Mn/kg as Mn sulfate or Mn methionine E (Mn Met E), Mn amino acid B (Mn AA B), or Mn amino acid C (Mn AA C) with weak, moderate, or strong chelation strength, respectively. Heart MnSOD mRNA levels were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR at 7, 14, or 21 d. The results showed that heart MnSOD mRNA level increased as dietary Mn level increased at any age. At 7 d, chicks fed the diet supplemented with Mn AA B had higher MnSOD mRNA levels than those fed the diet supplemented with Mn sulfate and Mn Met E, and the same tendency was observed at 14 or 21 d. The results suggest that MnSOD gene expression, which is regulated by dietary Mn at transcriptional level, could reflect differences among bio-availabilities of organic Mn sources as early as 7 d. Therefore, the estimation of relative bioavailabilities of Mn sources based on heart MnSOD mRNA level could require a shorter experimental period and a smaller number of animals, and thus less cost.", "journal": "Poultry science", "date": "2007-04-17", "authors": ["X GLuo", "S FLi", "LLu", "BLiu", "XKuang", "G ZShao", "S XYu"], "doi": "10.1093/ps/86.5.888"}

Cardiac viral load was high [4,277 +/- 1,009 plaque-forming units and 25 +/- 5 copies CVB3/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 mRNA] on day 4. The cardiac tissue exhibited severe inflammatory infiltration and myocyte damage with an average myocarditis integrated pathology score of 2.1 +/- 0.2 on day 7. Most of the mice infected with CVB3 also developed epicarditis, and 55% had intraventricular thrombi present. Treatment with mIFN-beta [2.5 to 10 million international units (MIU)/kg] dose-dependently improved the general health status in CVB3-inoculated mice, as evidenced by reduction in weight loss, prevention of death, elimination of cardiac viral load, protection of myocytes from injury, decrease in inflammatory cell infiltration, and attenuation of intraventricular thrombus formation. Treatment with 10 MIU/kg mIFN-alpha(2) resulted in a similar level of efficacy as that induced by 5 MIU/kg mIFN-beta, with the exception that mIFN-alpha(2) did not reduce cardiac CVB3 mRNA. However, mIFN-alpha(2) , but not any dose group of mIFN-beta, significantly attenuated CVB3-induced epicarditis.

Furthermore, we found that C57BL/6 mice, exposed to SWCNT (10 and 40 mug/mouse), developed aortic mtDNA damage at 7, 28, and 60 days after exposure. mtDNA damage was accompanied by changes in aortic mitochondrial glutathione and protein carbonyl levels. Because these modifications have been related to cardiovascular diseases, we evaluated whether repeated exposure to SWCNTs (20 mug/mouse once every other week for 8 weeks) stimulates the progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) transgenic mice. Although SWCNT exposure did not modify the lipid profiles of these mice, it resulted in accelerated plaque formation in ApoE(-/-) mice fed an atherogenic diet.

In addition to several transcriptional factors implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, we also looked at a number of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and fuel substrate utilization. Long-Evans rats were placed on either a copper-adequate (n=4) or copper-deficient (n=4) diet 3 days post weaning and remained on the diet for 5 weeks; their copper deficiency status was confirmed using previously established assays. Custom oligo arrays spotted with genes pertinent to mitochondrial biogenesis were hybridized with cRNA probes synthesized from the collected heart tissue. Chemiluminescent array images from both groups were analyzed for gene spot intensities and differential gene expression. Our results did not demonstrate any significant increase in Ppargc1a or its implicated targets, as we had predicted. However, consistent with previous data, an up-regulation of genes that encode for collagen type 3, fibronectin and elastin were found. Interestingly, there was also a significant increase in the expression of the transcriptional factor nuclear factor kappaB1 (Nfkappab1) in the copper-deficient treatment animals, compared to the control group, and this was confirmed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

{"title": "Beta-catenin downregulation is required for adaptive cardiac remodeling.", "abstract": "The armadillo-related protein beta-catenin has multiple functions in cardiac tissue homeostasis: stabilization of beta-catenin has been implicated in adult cardiac hypertrophy, and downregulation initiates heart formation in embryogenesis. The protein is also part of the cadherin/catenin complex at the cell membrane, where depletion might result in disturbed cell-cell interaction similar to N-cadherin knockout models. Here, we analyzed the in vivo role of beta-catenin in adult cardiac hypertrophy initiated by angiotensin II (Ang II). The cardiac-specific mifepristone-inducible alphaMHC-CrePR1 transgene was used to induce beta-catenin depletion (loxP-flanked exons 3 to 6, beta-cat(Deltaex3-6) mice) or stabilization (loxP-flanked exon 3, beta-cat(Deltaex3) mice). Levels of beta-catenin were altered both in membrane and nuclear extracts. Analysis of the beta-catenin target genes Axin2 and Tcf-4 confirmed increased beta-catenin-dependent transcription in beta-catenin stabilized mice. In both models, transgenic mice were viable and healthy at age 6 months. beta-Catenin appeared dispensable for cell membrane function. Ang II infusion induced cardiac hypertrophy both in wild-type mice and in mice with beta-catenin depletion. In contrast, mice with stabilized beta-catenin had decreased cross-sectional area at baseline and an abrogated hypertrophic response to Ang II infusion. Stabilizing beta-catenin led to impaired fractional shortening compared with control littermates after Ang II stimulation. This functional deterioration was associated with altered expression of the T-box proteins Tbx5 and Tbx20 at baseline and after Ang II stimulation. In addition, atrophy-related protein IGFBP5 was upregulated in beta-catenin-stabilized mice.

Electrical excitation is introduced by a periodic pacing of the lower septum. Depending on the pacing frequency, qualitatively different dynamics are observed, namely, normal heart beat, T-wave alternans, and 2:1 conduction block at small, intermediate, and large pacing frequencies, respectively. In a second step, we performed a numerical stability and bifurcation analysis of a pulse propagating in a one-dimensional (1D) ring of cardiac tissue. The precise onset of the alternans instability is obtained from computer-assisted linear stability analysis of the pulse and computation of the associated spectrum. The critical frequency at the onset of alternans and the profiles of the membrane potential agree well with the ones obtained in the 3D simulations. Next, we computed changes in the wave profiles and in the onset of alternans for the Beeler-Reuter model with modifications of the sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, respectively. For this purpose, we employ the method of numerical bifurcation and stability analysis. While blocking of calcium channels has a stabilizing effect, blocked sodium or potassium channels lead to the occurrence of alternans at lower pacing frequencies. The findings regarding channel blocking are verified within three-dimensional simulations. Altogether, we have found T-wave alternans and conduction block in 3D simulations of a realistic rabbit heart geometry. The onset of alternans has been analyzed by numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of 1D wave trains. By comparing the results of the two approaches, we find that alternans is not strongly influenced by ingredients such as 3D geometry and propagation anisotropy, but depends mostly on the frequency of pacing (frequency of subsequent action potentials). In addition, we have introduced numerical bifurcation and stability analysis as a tool into heart modeling and demonstrated its efficiency in scanning a large set of parameters in the case of models with reduced conductivity.

In such cases, the use of iterative solvers and parallel computing environments are mandatory to make parameter studies feasible. The preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is a standard choice for this problem. Although robust, its efficiency greatly depends on the choice of preconditioner. On structured grids, it has been demonstrated that a geometric multigrid preconditioner performs significantly better than an incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioner. However, unstructured grids are often preferred to better represent organ boundaries and allow for coarser discretization in the bath far from cardiac surfaces. Under these circumstances, algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are advantageous since they compute coarser levels directly from the system matrix itself, thus avoiding the complexity of explicitly generating coarser, geometric grids. In this paper, the performance of an AMG preconditioner (BoomerAMG) is compared with that of the standard ILU preconditioner and a direct solver. BoomerAMG is used in two different ways, as a preconditioner and as a standalone solver. Two 3-D simulation examples modeling the induction of arrhythmias in rabbit ventricles were used to measure performance in both sequential and parallel simulations. It is shown that the AMG preconditioner is very well suited for the solution of the bidomain equation, being clearly superior to ILU preconditioning in all regards, with speedups by factors in the range 5.9-7.7.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2007-04-05", "authors": ["GernotPlank", "ManfredLiebmann", "RodrigoWeber dos Santos", "Edward JVigmond", "GundolfHaase"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2006.889181"}

The cDNA of hLBH is 2927 bp long, encoding a protein product of 105 amino acids. The protein is highly conserved in evolution across different species from zebra fish, to mouse, to human. Northern blot analysis indicates that a 2.9 kb transcript specific for hLBH is most abundantly expressed in both embryonic and adult heart tissue. In COS-7 cells, hLBH proteins are localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. hLBH is a transcription activator when fused to Gal-4 DNA-binding domain.

{"title": "Interaction between spiral and paced waves in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "For prevention of lethal arrhythmias, patients at risk receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, which use high-frequency antitachycardia pacing (ATP) to convert tachycardias to a normal rhythm. One of the suggested ATP mechanisms involves paced-induced drift of rotating waves followed by their collision with the boundary of excitable tissue. This study provides direct experimental evidence of this mechanism. In monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in which rotating waves of activity were initiated by premature stimuli, we used the Ca(2+)-sensitive indicator fluo 4 to observe propagating wave patterns. The interaction of the spiral tip with a paced wave was then monitored at a high spatial resolution. In the course of the experiments, we observed spiral wave pinning to local heterogeneities within the myocyte layer. High-frequency pacing led, in a majority of cases, to successful termination of spiral activity. Our data show that 1) stable spiral waves in cardiac monolayers tend to be pinned to local heterogeneities or areas of altered conduction, 2) overdrive pacing can shift a rotating wave from its original site, and 3) the wave break, formed as a result of interaction between the spiral tip and a paced wave front, moves by a paced-induced drift mechanism to an area where it may become unstable or collide with a boundary.

Present studies were undertaken to assess gamma ray induced DNA damage in different organs of the chick embryo using alkaline comet assay and peripheral blood micronucleus test. Further the suitability of chick embryo, as an alternative model for genotoxicity evaluation of environmental agents was assessed. Fertilized eggs of Rhode island red strain were exposed to 0.5, 1 and 2Gy of gamma rays delivered at a dose rate of 0.316Gy/min using a (60)Co teletherapy machine. Peripheral blood smears were prepared from 8- to 11-day-old chick embryos for micronucleus test. Alkaline comet assay was performed on 11-day-old chick embryos in different organs such as the heart, liver, lung, blood, bone marrow, brain and kidney. Analysis of the data revealed a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes, micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes and total micronucleated erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of gamma irradiated chick embryos at all the doses tested as compared to the respective controls. The polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes ratio which is an indicator of proliferation rate of hematopoetic tissue, decreased in the irradiated groups as compared to the controls. Data obtained from comet assay, clearly demonstrated a significant increase in DNA strand breaks in all the organs of irradiated chick embryos as compared to the respective controls. However, maximum damage was observed in the heart tissue on all the doses tested, followed by kidney, brain, lung, blood and liver. The lowest damage was observed in the bone marrow tissue.

Rats were sacrificed after the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 60 days of dietary treatments. Lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters were determined in serum. Myocardial samples were used to determine oxidative stress, metabolic enzymes, glycogen and triacylglycerol.\nFRD rats showed higher final body weight and body mass index than CRD and C. Serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein were higher in FRD than in CRD, while triacylglycerol and oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were higher in CRD than in FRD. CRD rats had the highest myocardial lipid hydroperoxide and diminished superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Myocardial glycogen was lower and triacylglycerol was higher in CRD than in C and FRD rats. Although FRD rats had depressed myocardial-reducing power, no significant changes were observed in myocardial energy metabolism.

{"title": "Role of polyamines in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and their interactions with nitric oxide.", "abstract": "Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are present in all higher eukaryotic cells and are essential for cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Sharing common precursor with polyamines, nitric oxide (NO) is associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by the generation of peroxynitrite. Although polyamines have been implicated in tissue ischemia injury, their metabolism and interactions with NO in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury have not been fully understood. In our experiment, when Langendorff perfused rat hearts were subjected to 40 min ischemia without reperfusion, both ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and Spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) activities were up-regulated and putrescine accumulated. While after reperfusion, ODC activity decreased and SSAT activity increased, resulting in putrescine accumulation and decreased spermidine and spermine. Meanwhile NO content was increased. In addition, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) decreased ODC activity in cardiac tissue homogenate but increased SSAT activity in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-treatment of isolated heart with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase) increased ODC activity. Exogenous spermine (1 mM) administration prior to ischemia prevented spermine decrease, reduced cardiac myocyte necrosis and apoptosis, and promoted the recovery of cardiac function after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that acute heart ischemia activates myocardial polyamine stress response characterized by increased ODC and SSAT activities and accumulation of putrescine. Ischemia/reperfusion disturbs polyamine metabolism, and the loss of spermine might be associated with NO increase and thereby influences myocardial cell viability.

In cardiac tissue, chronic thiamine deficiency is described to cause changes in the myocardium that can be associated with arrhythmias. However, compared with the brain, very little is known about the effects of thiamine deficiency on the heart. Thus this study was undertaken to explore whether thiamine deprivation has a role in cardiac arrhythmogenesis. We examined hearts isolated from thiamine-deprived and control rats. We measured heart rate, diastolic and systolic tension, and contraction and relaxation rates. Whole cell voltage clamp was performed in rat isolated cardiac myocytes to measure L-type Ca(2+) current. In addition, we investigated the global intracellular calcium transients by using confocal microscopy in the line-scan mode. The hearts from thiamine-deficient rats did not degenerate into ventricular fibrillation during 30 min of reperfusion after 15 min of coronary occlusion. The antiarrhythmogenic effects were characterized by the arrhythmia severity index. Our results suggest that hearts from thiamine-deficient rats did not experience irreversible arrhythmias. There was no change in L-type Ca(2+) current density. Inactivation kinetics of this current in Ca(2+)-buffered cells was retarded in thiamine-deficient cardiac myocytes. The global Ca(2+) release was significantly reduced in thiamine-deficient cardiac myocytes. The amplitude of caffeine-releasable Ca(2+) was lower in thiamine-deficient myocytes.

Plasma adiponectin levels were analyzed by ELISA and adiponectin in heart was determined by immunohistochemical, Western blot and real-time PCR analyses.\nPlasma adiponectin levels declined after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury due to reductions in high molecular weight and, to a lesser extent, trimer and hexamer isoforms. Adiponectin protein was detected in injured but not sham-operated heart, and this was accompanied by a negligible increase in adiponectin transcript in the myocardium. Systemic delivery of adiponectin to adiponectin knockout (APN-KO) mice led to the accumulation of adiponectin in ischemia-reperfusion-injured, but not-uninjured hearts at levels comparable to wild-type suggesting that cardiac expression of adiponectin does not appreciably contribute to its accumulation in the infarcted heart.

Oxidative stress is a condition induced by some pro-oxidant compounds, such as by tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP) and can also be induced in vivo by ischemia/reperfusion conditions, which is very common in cardiac tissue. The cell line H9c2 has been used as an in vitro cellular model for both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Understanding how these cells respond to oxidative agents may furnish novel insights into how cardiac and skeletal tissues respond to oxidative stress conditions. The objective of this work was to characterize, through vital imaging, morphological alterations and the appearance of apoptotic hallmarks, with a special focus on mitochondrial changes, upon exposure of H9c2 cells to tBHP.\nWhen exposed to tBHP, an increase in intracellular oxidative stress was detected in H9c2 cells by epifluorescence microscopy, which was accompanied by an increase in cell death that was prevented by the antioxidants Trolox and N-acetylcysteine. Several morphological alterations characteristic of apoptosis were noted, including changes in nuclear morphology, translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, and cell blebbing. An increase in the exposure period or in tBHP concentration resulted in a clear loss of membrane integrity, which is characteristic of necrosis. Changes in mitochondrial morphology, consisting of a transition from long filaments to small and round fragments, were also detected in H9c2 cells after treatment with tBHP. Bax aggregates near mitochondrial networks were formed after short periods of incubation.\nVital imaging of alterations in cell morphology is a useful method to characterize cellular responses to oxidative stress. In the present work, we report two distinct patterns of morphological alterations in H9c2 cells exposed to tBHP, a pro-oxidant agent frequently used as model to induce oxidative stress.

{"title": "Spiral-wave dynamics depend sensitively on inhomogeneities in mathematical models of ventricular tissue.", "abstract": "Every sixth death in industrialized countries occurs because of cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). There is growing consensus that VT is associated with an unbroken spiral wave of electrical activation on cardiac tissue but VF with broken waves, spiral turbulence, spatiotemporal chaos and rapid, irregular activation. Thus spiral-wave activity in cardiac tissue has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, many aspects of such spiral dynamics remain elusive because of the intrinsically high-dimensional nature of the cardiac-dynamical system. In particular, the role of tissue heterogeneities in the stability of cardiac spiral waves is still being investigated. Experiments with conduction inhomogeneities in cardiac tissue yield a variety of results: some suggest that conduction inhomogeneities can eliminate VF partially or completely, leading to VT or quiescence, but others show that VF is unaffected by obstacles. We propose theoretically that this variety of results is a natural manifestation of a complex, fractal-like boundary that must separate the basins of the attractors associated, respectively, with spiral breakup and single spiral wave. We substantiate this with extensive numerical studies of Panfilov and Luo-Rudy I models, where we show that the suppression of spiral breakup depends sensitively on the position, size, and nature of the inhomogeneity.", "journal": "Physical review.

{"title": "Transient receptor potential ion channels control thermoregulatory behaviour in reptiles.", "abstract": "Biological functions are governed by thermodynamics, and animals regulate their body temperature to optimise cellular performance and to avoid harmful extremes. The capacity to sense environmental and internal temperatures is a prerequisite for the evolution of thermoregulation. However, the mechanisms that enable ectothermic vertebrates to sense heat remain unknown. The recently discovered thermal characteristics of transient receptor potential ion channels (TRP) render these proteins suitable to act as temperature sensors. Here we test the hypothesis that TRPs are present in reptiles and function to control thermoregulatory behaviour. We show that the hot-sensing TRPV1 is expressed in a crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), an agamid (Amphibolurus muricatus) and a scincid (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii) lizard, as well as in the quail and zebrafinch (Coturnix chinensis and Poephila guttata). The TRPV1 genes from all reptiles form a unique clade that is delineated from the mammalian and the ancestral Xenopus sequences by an insertion of two amino acids. TRPV1 and the cool-sensing TRPM8 are expressed in liver, muscle (transversospinalis complex), and heart tissues of the crocodile, and have the potential to act as internal thermometer and as external temperatures sensors. Inhibition of TRPV1 and TRPM8 in C. porosus abolishes the typically reptilian shuttling behaviour between cooling and heating environments, and leads to significantly altered body temperature patterns. Our results provide the proximate mechanism of thermal selection in terrestrial ectotherms, which heralds a fundamental change in interpretation, because TRPs provide the mechanism for a tissue-specific input into the animals' thermoregulatory response.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2007-03-16", "authors": ["FrankSeebacher", "Shauna AMurray"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0000281"}

Circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in cell death following a variety of stimuli. Macrophages, platelets, neutrophils and the endothelium have been shown to release IL-6 after IR injury. Cardiac mast cells have been implicated in IR; however, their involvement has never been quantified. In this randomized, prospective study, we compared cardiac tissue susceptibility and serum IL-6 changes between mast cell deficient (W/Wv) mice and their normal littermates (+/+). Twenty-eight male W/Wv mice (n=14) and their +/+ littermates (n=14) were anaesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane. The left coronary artery (LCA) was ligated for 30 minutes or a sham procedure was performed. After 6 hours of reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed. The muscle viability was assessed on fresh whole-mount slices by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) histochemical assay and serum IL-6 concentrations measured by ELISA. Cardiac muscle viability was significantly higher in W/Wv mice than the +/+ mice. Serum IL-6 levels were higher in the +/+ sham mice (465 +/- 32 pg/ml, n=6) than the W/Wv mice (185 +/- 31 pg/ml, n=6), p < 0.001.

These results show that the absence of mast cells reduces the myocardial damage associated with IR injury.

{"title": "Detection of intramyocardial scroll waves using absorptive transillumination imaging.", "abstract": "Optical imaging using voltage-sensitive dyes has become an important tool for studying vortex-like electrical waves in the heart. Such waves, known as spiral or scroll waves, can spontaneously form in pathological ventricular myocardium, causing ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Until recently, observations of scroll waves were limited to their surface manifestations, thus providing little information about the shape and location of their organizing center, the filament. We use computer modeling to assess the feasibility of visualizing filaments using dynamic transillumination imaging in conjunction with near-IR voltage-sensitive absorptive dyes (absorptive transillumination). We simulate transillumination signals produced by the intramural scroll waves in a realistic slab of ventricular tissue with trabeculated endocardial surface. The computations use a detailed ionic model of electrical excitation (LRd) coupled to a photon transport model for cardiac tissue. Our simulations show that dynamic absorptive transillumination data, with subsequent processing involving either amplitude maps, time-space plots, or power-of-the-dominant-frequency maps, can be used to reliably detect intramural scroll waves through the whole thickness (approximately 10 mm) of the ventricular wall.

The present study was designed to determine the mechanism by which adiponectin exerts its protective effects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.\nAdiponectin-/- or wild-type mice were subjected to 30 minutes of myocardial ischemia followed by 3 hours or 24 hours (infarct size and cardiac function) of reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size and apoptosis, production of peroxynitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and gp91(phox) protein expression were compared. Myocardial apoptosis and infarct size were markedly enhanced in adiponectin-/- mice (P<0.01). Formation of NO, superoxide, and their cytotoxic reaction product, peroxynitrite, were all significantly higher in cardiac tissue obtained from adiponectin-/- than from wild-type mice (P<0.01). Moreover, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-induced iNOS and gp91(phox) protein expression was further enhanced, but endothelial NOS phosphorylation was reduced in cardiac tissue from adiponectin-/- mice. Administration of the globular domain of adiponectin 10 minutes before reperfusion reduced myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-induced iNOS/gp91(phox) protein expression, decreased NO/superoxide production, blocked peroxynitrite formation, and reversed proapoptotic and infarct-enlargement effects observed in adiponectin-/- mice.\nThe present study demonstrates that adiponectin is a natural molecule that protects hearts from ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibition of iNOS and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase protein expression and resultant oxidative/nitrative stress.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2007-03-07", "authors": ["LingTao", "ErheGao", "XiangyingJiao", "YuexingYuan", "ShuzhuangLi", "Theodore AChristopher", "Bernard LLopez", "WalterKoch", "LawrenceChan", "Barry JGoldstein", "Xin LMa"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.666941"}
{"title": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor expression in cardiac fibroblasts is modulated by in vitro culture conditions.", "abstract": "The bioactive molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) binds with high affinity to five recognized receptors (S1P(1-5)) to affect various tissues, including cellular responses of cardiac fibroblasts (CFbs) and myocytes. CFbs are essential components of myocardium, and detailed study of their cell signaling and physiology is required for a number of emerging disciplines. Meaningful studies on CFbs, however, necessitate methods for selective, reproducible cell isolations. Macrophages reside within normal cardiac tissues and often are isolated with CFbs. A protocol was therefore developed that significantly reduces macrophage levels and utilizes more CFb-specific markers (discoidin domain receptor-2) instead of, or in addition to, more commonly used cytoskeletal markers. Our results demonstrate that primary isolated, purified CFbs express predominantly S1P(1-3); however, the relative levels of these receptor subtypes are modulated with time and by culture conditions. In coculture experiments, macrophages altered CFb S1P receptor levels relative to controls. Further investigations using known macrophage-secreted factors showed that S1P and H(2)O(2) had minimal effects on CFb S1P(1-3) expression, whereas transforming growth factor-beta1, TNF-alpha, and PDGF-BB significantly altered all S1P receptor subtypes. Lowering FBS concentrations from 10% to 0.1% increased S1P(2), whereas supplementation with either PDGF-BB or Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y-27632 significantly elevated S1P(3) levels. S1P(2) and S1P(3) receptor levels are known to regulate cell migration. Using cells isolated from either normal or S1P(3)-null mice, we demonstrate that S1P(3) is important and necessary for CFb migration.

To explore the cardioprotective effect of green tea in diabetes, we study the effect of green tea extract on myocardial collagen characteristics in streptozotocin diabetic rats. The effect of green tea on marker enzymes in serum and cardiac tissues were also assayed to understand the extent of protection. Six weeks after the diabetes induction, diabetic rats were treated with green tea extract [300 mg (kg body weight)(-1)day(-1)] for 4 weeks. AGE were determined by fluorescence assay and cross-linking of collagen by solubility measurement while collagen content was measured by biochemical assay. The activities of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CPK) were measured by biochemical assay. The increase in blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and systolic blood pressure in diabetic rats were reduced upon green tea treatment. The activities of AST, LDH and CPK were significantly increased in serum whereas decreased in cardiac tissues in diabetic rats representing the cardiac damage. Administration of green tea to diabetic rats significantly ameliorates these enzyme activities. There was no significant difference in the myocardial collagen content among the experimental rats.

Although participation of calpain calcium-activated proteases in post-necrotic myocardial autolysis is well characterized, their importance in homeostatic turnover of normal cardiac tissue is controversial. Hence, we evaluated the consequences of physiologic calpain (calcium-activated protease) activity in cultured cardiomyocytes and unstressed mouse hearts. Comparison of in vitro proteolytic activities of cardiac-expressed calpains 1 and 2 revealed calpain 1, but not calpain 2, activity at physiological calcium concentrations. Physiological calpain 1 activation was evident in adenoviral transfected cultured cardiomyocytes as proteolysis of specific substrates, generally increased protein ubiquitination, and accelerated protein turnover, that were each inhibited by coexpression of the inhibitor protein calpastatin. Conditional forced expression of calpain 1, but not calpain 2, in mouse hearts demonstrated substrate-specific proteolytic activity under basal conditions, with hyperubiquitination of cardiac proteins and increased 26S proteasome activity. Loss of myocardial calpain activity by forced expression of calpastatin diminished ubiquitination of 1 or more specific myocardial proteins, without affecting overall ubiquitination or proteasome activity, and resulted in a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates, formation of autophagosomes, and degeneration of sarcomeres. Thus, calpain 1 is upstream of, and necessary for, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of a subset of myocardial proteins whose abnormal accumulation produces autophagosomes and degeneration of cardiomyocytes with functional decompensation.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2007-03-03", "authors": ["Anita SGalvez", "AbhinavDiwan", "Amy MOdley", "Harvey SHahn", "HannaOsinska", "Jaime GMelendez", "JeffreyRobbins", "Roy ALynch", "YehiaMarreez", "Gerald WDorn"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000261938.28365.11"}

Effects of insulin treatment were also evaluated. The diabetic state severely compromised the ROS defense mechanism in the cardiac tissue and the effects were more pronounced in the female than in the male rats. There was several fold increase in the xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in general and the magnitude of increase was higher in the females; insulin treatment resulted in further increase in the XO activity. The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and catalase activities decreased and the reduced glutathione (GSH) content in mitochondria was completely depleted in diabetic state with significant decrease in the GSH levels in the post-mitochondrial fraction; the effect was more pronounced in the females. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPox) activities increased in the diabetic state to a greater extent in male rats.

Mechanical stimuli have been shown to stimulate protein expression and the differentiation of mammalian cells from contractile tissues. Our aim was to obtain a flexible scaffold which could be used to apply mechanical forces during tissue regeneration. Poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citric acid) (POC) is an elastomer that can be processed into scaffolds for tissue engineering. We investigated the effect of modifying the porosity on the mechanical properties of the POC scaffolds. In addition, the effects of the storage method and strain rate on material integrity were assessed. The maximum elongation of POC porous films varied from 60% to 160% of their original length. A decrease in the porosity caused a rise in this elastic modulus. The attachment of HL-1 cardiomyocytes to POC was assessed on films coated with fibronectin, collagen and laminin. These extracellular matrix proteins promoted cell adhesion in a protein-type- and concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, POC scaffolds can be optimised to meet the mechanical and biological parameters needed for cardiac culture.

It is mainly related to illicit substances such as cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and amphetamine. According to the findings in the literature, it is most likely that myocardial ischemia due to amphetamine abuse is a result of combined mechanisms which include coronary artery vasospasm, and in lesser extent thrombus formation or direct myocardial toxicity. Diazepam is also usually found as a substance of abuse. Recent findings indicate that diazepam exerts an inhibitory activity on different isoforms of the enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which can be found in the heart muscle and also show that diazepam potentate the positive inotropic effect of both noradrenaline and adrenaline, which subsequently leads to increase in myocardial contractility. We propose that dual intoxication with amphetamine and benzodiazepine potentate their effects on cardiac tissue and coronary arteries which results in larger myocardial injury.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2007-02-27", "authors": ["BorisStarcevic", "MarioSicaja"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2006.12.033"}

However, whether the patterns of progression of LB and neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease are identical to those in other Lewy body diseases (LBD) remains unclear. In addition, pathological data on the autonomic nervous system involvement in LBD are limited. We present here the clinicopathological characteristics of two autopsy cases with both Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), possibly diagnosed as having Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBV/AD). Our patients presented clinically with dementia without parkinsonism. Histopathologically, phosphorylated alpha-synuclein-positive LB and Lewy neurites were abundant in the limbic system, especially in the amygdala, and to a lesser degree, in the neocortex, including the primary motor cortex. The amygdala was also most severely affected by neuronal loss, and the other limbic areas and neocortex were affected to a lesser degree. Despite the existence of a small number of LB and many Lewy neurites, neurons in the brainstem nuclei were relatively well preserved. The Braak stages of concurrent neurofibrillary changes and senile plaques were stage V and C, respectively, in both cases. Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive nerve fibers were relatively well spared in one case examined compared with Parkinson's disease cases. Furthermore, many Lewy neurites immunopositive for phosphorylated a-synuclein were found in the nerve fascicles of the epicardium in one case examined and in Parkinson's disease cases to a lesser degree. These findings suggest that: (i) in at least some LBV/AD cases, the amygdala develops neuronal loss and Lewy-related pathology prior to the brainstem nuclei; and (ii) the depletion of nerves in the heart tissue of LBV/AD is not necessarily complete despite the development of Lewy-related pathology.", "journal": "Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology", "date": "2007-02-27", "authors": ["OsamuYokota", "KuniakiTsuchiya", "ToshikiUchihara", "HiroshiUjike", "SeishiTerada", "MafuyuTakahashi", "YujiKimura", "HidekiIshizu", "HaruhikoAkiyama", "ShigetoshiKuroda"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1440-1789.2006.00736.x"}

When general anaesthesia (GA) is combined with TEA during coronary artery bypass graft, we investigated whether TEA together with GA play a role on VEGF and i-NOS expression in human heart tissue in cardiac ischemia.\nRight atrial biopsy samples were taken before CPB, before aortic cross clamp (ACC) and at 15 min after ACC release (after ischemia and reperfusion). Human heart tissues were obtained from the TEA+GA and GA groups. Immunocytochemistry was performed using antibodies for VEGF and i-NOS.\nBoth VEGF and i-NOS immunoreactivity was observed in cardiomyocytes and arteriol walls.

{"title": "Effects of early afterdepolarizations on reentry in cardiac tissue: a simulation study.", "abstract": "Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are classically generated at slow heart rates when repolarization reserve is reduced by genetic diseases or drugs. However, EADs may also occur at rapid heart rates if repolarization reserve is sufficiently reduced. In this setting, spontaneous diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release can facilitate cellular EAD formation by augmenting inward currents during the action potential plateau, allowing reactivation of the window L-type Ca current to reverse repolarization. Here, we investigated the effects of spontaneous SR Ca release-induced EADs on reentrant wave propagation in simulated one-, two-, and three-dimensional homogeneous cardiac tissue using a version of the Luo-Rudy dynamic ventricular action potential model modified to increase the likelihood of these EADs. We found: 1) during reentry, nonuniformity in spontaneous SR Ca release related to subtle differences in excitation history throughout the tissue created adjacent regions with and without EADs. This allowed EADs to initiate new wavefronts propagating into repolarized tissue; 2) EAD-generated wavefronts could propagate in either the original or opposite direction, as a single new wave or two new waves, depending on the refractoriness of tissue bordering the EAD region; 3) by suddenly prolonging local refractoriness, EADs caused rapid rotor displacement, shifting the electrical axis; and 4) rapid rotor displacement promoted self-termination by collision with tissue borders, but persistent EADs could regenerate single or multiple focal excitations that reinitiated reentry. These findings may explain many features of Torsades des pointes, such as perpetuation by focal excitations, rapidly changing electrical axis, frequent self-termination, and occasional degeneration to fibrillation.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Cardiovascular developmental insights from embryos.", "abstract": "We investigate cardiovascular (CV) developmental physiology and biomechanics in order to understand the dramatic acquisition of form and function during normal development and to identify the adaptive mechanisms that allow embryos to survive adverse genetic and epigenetic events. Cardiovascular patterning, morphogenesis, and growth occur via highly conserved genetic mechanisms. Structural and functional maturation of the embryonic heart is also conserved across a broad range of species with evidence for load dependence from onset of the heartbeat. The embryonic heart dynamically adapts to changes in biomechanical loading conditions and for reasons not yet clear, adapts better to increased than to decreased mechanical load. In mammals, maternal cardiovascular function dynamically impacts embryonic/fetal growth and hemodynamics and these interactions can now be studied longitudinally using high-resolution noninvasive techniques. Maternal exposure to hypoxia and to bioactive chemicals, such as caffeine, can rapidly impact embryonic/fetal cardiovascular function, growth, and outcome. Finally, tissue engineering approaches can be applied to investigate basic developmental aspects of the embryonic myocardium. We use isolated embryonic and fetal chick, mouse, or rat cardiac cells to generate 3D engineered early embryonic cardiac tissues (EEECT). EEECT retains the morphologic and proliferative features of embryonic myocardium, responds to increased mechanical load with myocyte hyperplasia, and may be an excellent future material for use in cardiac repair and regeneration.

Five infants not having VSD were classified as controls (Group I). Twenty VSD patients were then divided into 2 groups according to their shunting magnitude index (level of pulmonary vascular resistance compared with systemic vascular resistance, Qp/Qs).

{"title": "Development of the cardiac conduction system.", "abstract": "The cardiac conduction system (CCS) is a specialized tissue network that initiates and maintains a rhythmic heartbeat. The CCS consists of several functional subcomponents responsible for producing a pacemaking impulse and distributing action potentials across the heart in a coordinated manner. The formation of the distinct subcomponents of the CCS occurs within a precise temporal and spatial framework; thereby assuring that as the system matures from a tubular to a complex chambered organ, a rhythmic heartbeat is always maintained. Therefore, a defect in differentiation of any CCS component would lead to severe rhythm disturbances. Recent molecular, cell biological and physiological approaches have provided fresh and unexpected perspectives of the relationships between cell fate, gene expression and differentiation of specialized function within the developing myocardium. In particular, biomechanical forces created by the heartbeat itself have important roles in the inductive patterning and functional integration of the developing conduction system.

Tail-cuff blood pressure was performed on all mice. Blood pressure determinations showed no differences in systolic or mean blood pressure in WT (+/+), KO (-/-) or HETERO (+/-) mice at 3 and 6 months. However, decreased systolic BP in the KO mice relative to WT at 9 months of age was observed. ECG analysis showed no significant differences in the intact KO, HETERO or WT mice. The mice were killed at 12 months. Heart weight/body weight ratio was 41% (P<.003) greater in the KO mice versus WT and HETERO was 19% (P<.05) increased versus WT. Other VDR-KO tissues did not display hypertrophy. Cross sectional and longitudinal analysis of the heart myofibrils showed highly significant cellular hypertrophy in VDR-KO mice. Trichrome staining of heart tissue showed marked increase in fibrotic lesions in the KO mice. Analysis of plasma renin activity, angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone levels showed elevated but not significantly different renin activity in KO versus WT and no significant differences in AII or aldosterone levels. Our data do not support the concept that the renin-angiotensin system or hypertension are the factors that elicit these changes.

Administration of PUFA concentrate significantly prevented the isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of plasma diagnostic marker enzymes (ALT [93.5%], AST [95.6%], LDH [94.7%] and CPK [96.1%]).

Although there is an increasing amount of data on the biological role of biglycan protein, its function is still poorly understood. We aimed to gather more information about the biological function of biglycan protein in the cardiac tissues, and its role in signal transduction. Therefore, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing the human biglycan protein and analyzed the cardiac protein profile of transgenic offsprings using quantitative real-time (QRT)-PCR and proteomics. QRT-PCR results showed that most members of extracellular matrix were downregulated whereas cadherins, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta2 were upregulated. Antibody microarrayer experiment revealed that pyk2, RAF-1, Mcl-1, syntrophin, calmodulin, isoforms of NOS protein family (eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS), and synaptotagmin proteins were unambiguously upregulated in the heart of biglycan transgenic mice. In this study we show that biglycan directly or indirectly activates proteins involved in cardiac remodeling (TGF-beta, pyk2), signal transduction (RAF-1, Mcl-1, syntrophin, calmodulin, nNOS p38MAPK and MAP kinases), cardioprotection (NOS family, TGF-beta) and Ca++ signaling (connexin, calmodulin, synaptotagmin).

Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) is one such pathology and features TTR-containing amyloid deposits that are found primarily in the heart. The cause for this transition from soluble to insoluble protein in SSA is yet to be determined as specific structural features that might favor TTR fibrillogenesis have not yet been identified. The precise characterization of ex vivo fibril deposits might provide insight, but structural analyses of TTR from amyloid deposits have been hindered thus far by the lack of purification strategies that overcome the insolubility of the tissue-derived protein without degrading it. Consequently, the true biochemical nature of deposited TTR remains in question. In this study, we provide detailed analyses of both the soluble (serum) and deposited (tissue) forms of TTR from cases of SSA. In the serum, a distribution of mixed disulfides, specifically S-sulfonated and S-cysteinylated forms of TTR, as well as the unmodified protein were identified. The relative levels of the three TTR species in the SSA group were comparable to amounts present in sera from age-matched control groups. For characterization of the amyloid deposited TTR, we investigated cardiac tissue samples obtained from three separate cases of SSA. We report a novel chromatographic purification strategy performed under nonreducing conditions (to maintain cysteine disulfide status) and the use of this procedure in conjunction with detailed mass spectrometric analysis of TTR from the amyloid deposits. A series of C-terminal TTR fragments with N-termini ranging from amino acids 46 to 55 were identified. We also determined that the deposits in all samples contained Cys10 disulfide-linkedhomodimers composed of full-length TTR monomers.

In the present study, we investigated the time course of expression of eight different AAV serotypes in rat myocardium and the nature of the immunity against these serotypes. We first assessed whether neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were present for any of the serotype in the rats. We injected 100 microl of each AAV 1-8 serotype (10(12) DNAse resistant particles/ml), encoding LacZ gene, into the apical wall of rat myocardium. At 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks after gene delivery, the animals were killed and beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity was assessed by luminometry. Additionally, LacZ genomic copies and AAV capsids copies were measured through standard polymerase chain reaction analysis and cryo-sections from the area of viral injection were stained for X-gal detection at the same time points. No NAbs were detected against any of AAV serotypes. At all the time points studied, AAV1, 6 and 8 demonstrated the highest efficiency in transducing rat hearts in vivo. Parallel to the results with beta-gal activity, the highest levels LacZ and AAV DNA genomic copies were with AAV1, 6 and 8. The positive X-gal staining depicted by these serotypes confirmed these results. These results indicate that among the various AAV serotypes, AAV1, 6 and 8 have differential tropism for the heart unaffected by pre-existing NAb in the rat.

Kv7.2-5 channels are predominantly neuronal channels and are important for controlling excitability. Kv7.1 channels have been considered the only Kv7 channels to undergo inactivation upon depolarization. However, here we demonstrate that inactivation is also an intrinsic property of Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 channels, which inactivate to a larger extent than Kv7.1 channels at all potentials. We demonstrate that at least 30% of these channels are inactivated at physiologically relevant potentials. The onset of inactivation is voltage dependent and occurs on the order of seconds. Both time- and voltage-dependent recovery from inactivation was investigated for Kv7.4 channels. A time constant of 1.47 +/- 0.21 s and a voltage constant of 54.9 +/- 3.4 mV were determined. It was further demonstrated that heteromeric Kv7.3/Kv7.4 channels had inactivation properties different from homomeric Kv7.4 channels.

The detection of sca-1(+), c-kit(+), or isl-1(+) cardiac precursors and the creation of cardiospheres from adult heart tissues suggest that a persistent population of immature progenitor cells is present in the mature myocardium.

{"title": "Mechanisms of action of mesenchymal stem cells in cardiac repair: potential influences on the cardiac stem cell niche.", "abstract": "Clinical and basic studies of cell-based myocardial therapy have proceeded at a rapid pace. Cell therapy could lead to successful cardiac regeneration or repair by any of three general mechanisms: differentiation of the administered cells into all of the cellular constituents of the heart; release of factors capable of paracrine signaling from the administered cells; and fusion of the administered cells with the existing constituents of the heart. Here, we argue that a fourth general mechanism could be operative: stimulation of endogenous repair by injected cells, which and might cause the regeneration of stem cell niches. In a porcine model of myocardial infarction, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells stimulated substantial improvement in the ejection fraction, reduction of infarct size, and the growth of a rim of new cardiac tissue in the region in which the mesenchymal stem cells were injected. These effects occurred in the absence of definitive cardiac myocyte differentiation. After myocardial infarction, porcine hearts exhibit evidence of cardiac myocytes that have entered the cell cycle, neovascularization, and reduced levels of apoptosis.

Some cancer patients receiving ADR treatment develop a transient memory loss, inability to handle complex tasks etc., often referred to by patients as chemobrain. We previously demonstrated that ADR causes CNS toxicity, in part, via systemic release of cytokines and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in the brain.

However, the decline in mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial protein nitration after ADR treatment was observed only in wild-type mice, not in the iNOSKO mice. Importantly, the activity of a major mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), was reduced and the protein was nitrated.

However, this strategy has been hampered by the lack of sources for human cardiomyocytes and by the scarce vasculature in the ischemic area limiting the engraftment and survival of the transplanted muscle. Beyond the necessity of endothelial capillaries for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the grafted muscle tissue, interactions between endothelial and cardiomyocyte cells may also play a key role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. In the present study, we describe the formation of synchronously contracting engineered human cardiac tissue derived from human embryonic stem cells containing endothelial vessel networks. The 3D muscle consisted of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), and embryonic fibroblasts (EmFs). The formed vessels were further stabilized by the presence of mural cells originating from the EmFs. The presence of EmFs decreased EC death and increased EC proliferation. Moreover, the presence of endothelial capillaries augmented cardiomyocyte proliferation and did not hamper cardiomyocyte orientation and alignment. Immunostaining, ultrastructural analysis (using transmission electron microscopy), RT-PCR, pharmacological, and confocal laser calcium imaging studies demonstrated the presence of cardiac-specific molecular, ultrastructural, and functional properties of the generated tissue constructs with synchronous activity mediated by action potential propagation through gap junctions.

{"title": "The bone morphogenetic protein antagonist noggin regulates mammalian cardiac morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play many roles in mammalian cardiac development. Here we address the functions of Noggin, a dedicated BMP antagonist, in the developing mouse heart. In early cardiac tissues, the Noggin gene is mainly expressed in the myocardial cells of the outflow tract, atrioventricular canal, and future right ventricle. The major heart phenotypes of Noggin mutant embryos are thicker myocardium and larger endocardial cushions. Both defects result from increased cell number. Cell proliferation is increased and cell cycle exit is decreased in the myocardium. Although we find evidence of increased BMP signal transduction in the myocardium and endocardium, we show that the cardiac defects of Noggin mutants are rescued by halving the gene dosage of Bmp4. In culture, BMP increases the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of endocardial explant cells. Increased EMT likely accounts for the enlarged atrioventricular cushion. In the outflow tract cushion, we observed an increased contribution of cardiac neural crest cells to the mutant cushion mesenchyme, although many cells of the cushion were not derived from neural crest. Thus the enlarged outflow tract cushion of Noggin mutants likely arises by increased contributions both of endocardial cells that have undergone EMT as well as cells that have migrated from the neural crest. These data indicate that antagonism of BMP signaling by Noggin plays a critical role in ensuring proper levels of cell proliferation and EMT during cardiac morphogenesis in the mouse.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2007-01-16", "authors": ["MurimChoi", "Rolf WStottmann", "Yu-PingYang", "Erik NMeyers", "JohnKlingensmith"], "doi": "10.1161/01.RES.0000257780.60484.6a"}
{"title": "Ligustrazine attenuates acute myocardium injury after thermal trauma.", "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of ligustrazine on burn-induced myocardiac injury as well as TNF-alpha levels in severely burned rats.

Myocardial injury was assessed at 6h after burn by detecting serum levels of creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as water content, histological score, and ultrastructure change of cardiac tissue. In addition, myocardium ATP content was analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to examine cardiac tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. The results showed that burn trauma resulted in the increasing serum LDH and CK-MB, elevated myocardial water content, aggravated myocardial histological and ultrastructural lesions, increased myocardium ATP, and serum TNF-alpha. Ligustrazine 10mg/kg iv markedly inhibited increases in serum CK-MB and LDH, reduced myocardial water content from 76.91+/-0.19% in control group to 75.40+/-0.57%, significantly decreased the histologic scores of myocardium, and mollified the ultrastructural damage in cardiac myocytes.

Female Wistar rats were divided into seven groups, each composed of nine rats: two negative control groups, two positive control groups, one erdosteine-treated group (500 mg kg(-1)), one NAC-treated group (500 mg kg(-1)) and one vitamin E-treated group (500 mg kg(-1)). Nicotine was intraperitoneally injected at a dosage of 0.6 mg kg(-1) for 21 days. Following nicotine injection, the antioxidants were administered orally; treatment was continued until the rats were killed. Heart tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological assessments. Apoptosis level in cardiomyocytes was determined by using TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick endlabelling) method. Staining of cytoplasmic TNF-alpha in cardiomyocytes and heart MPO activity were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The treatments with erdosteine, NAC and vitamin E significantly reduced the rate of nicotine-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The effect of vitamin E on apoptosis regulation was weaker than the effects of erdosteine and NAC. Erdosteine, NAC and vitamin E significantly reduced the increases in the local production of TNF-alpha and heart MPO activity.

{"title": "Cardiac regeneration by resident stem and progenitor cells in the adult heart.", "abstract": "Two main pieces of data have created a new field in cardiac research. First, the traditional view on the heart as a postmitotic organ has been challenged by the finding of small dividing cells in the heart expressing cardiac contractile proteins with stem cell properties and, second, cellular therapy of the diseased heart using a variety of different cells has shown encouraging effects on cardiac function. These findings immediately raise questions like \"what is the identity and origin of the cardiac progenitor cells?\",\"which molecular factors are involved in their mobilization and differentiation?\", and \"can these cells repair the damaged heart?\" This review will address the state of current answers to these questions. Emerging evidence suggests that several subpopulations of cardiac stem or progenitor cells (CPCs) reside within the adult heart. CPCs with the ability to differentiate into all the constituent cells in the adult heart including cardiac myocytes, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells have been identified. Valuable knowledge has been obtained from the large number of animal studies and a number of small clinical trials that have utilized a variety of adult stem cells for regenerating infarcted hearts. However, contradictory reports on the regenerative potential of the CPCs exist, and the mechanisms behind the reported hemodynamic effects are intensely debated. Besides directly replenishing cardiac tissue, CPCs could also function by stimulating angiogenesis and improving survival of existing cells by secretion of paracrine factors. With this review we suggest that a better understanding of CPC biology will be pivotal for progressing therapeutic cardiac regeneration. This includes an extended knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind their mobilization, differentiation, survival and integration in the myocardium.", "journal": "Basic research in cardiology", "date": "2007-01-12", "authors": ["StigLyngbaek", "MikaelSchneider", "Jakob LHansen", "S\u00f8ren PSheikh"], "doi": "10.1007/s00395-007-0638-3"}

{"title": "Accelerated mitochondrial adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate transport improves hypertension-induced heart disease.", "abstract": "Strong evidence suggests that mitochondrial malfunction, which leads to disturbed energy metabolism and stimulated apoptosis, is a linchpin in the induction and manifestation of cardiac failure. An adequate exchange of ATP and ADP over the inner mitochondrial membrane by the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is thereby essential to guarantee the cellular energy supply.\nTo explore the effect of an ameliorated mitochondrial ATP/ADP transportation on cardiac dysfunction, we generated transgenic rats overexpressing ANT1 in the heart (ANT rats) and crossed them with renin-overexpressing rats (REN rats) suffering from hypertension-induced cardiac insufficiency. Cardiac-specific ANT1 overexpression resulted in a higher ATP/ADP transportation and elevated activities of respiratory chain complexes. Increased ANT activity in double-transgenic (ANT/REN) animals did not influence excessive hypertension seen in REN rats. Hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy in the REN rats was prevented by parallel ANT1 overexpression, however, and left ventricular function remarkably improved. The ANT1 overexpression led to a reduction in fibrosis and an improvement in cardiac tissue architecture. Consequently, the survival rate of ANT/REN rats was enhanced. Further investigations into the cardioprotective mechanism of ANT1 overexpression revealed improved mitochondrial structure and function and significantly reduced apoptosis in ANT/REN rats, shown by lowered cytosolic/mitochondrial cytochrome c ratio, reduced caspase 3 level, and prevented DNA degradation.\nMyocardial ANT1 overexpression protects against hypertension-induced cardiac pathology.

Nevertheless, further investigations on basic issues such as ideal cell type continue to be evaluated. Therefore, the aim of our studies was to compare the performance of skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes with respect to their proliferation rate and viability on different extracellular matrix components (EMCs). Rat cardiomyocytes (RCM) and rat skeletal muscle cells (RSMC) were cultured on EMCs such as collagen type I, type IV, laminin, and fibronectin. The components were used as \"single coating\" as well as \"double coating.\" Proliferation rates were determined by proliferation assays on days 1, 2, 4, and 8 after inoculation of the cells. The most essential result is that collagen type I enhances the proliferation rate of RSMC but decreases the proliferation of RCM significantly. This effect is independent of the second EMC used for the double-coating studies. Other EMCs also influence cellular behavior, whereas the sequence of the EMCs is essential. Results obtained in our studies reveal the significant different proliferation behavior of RCM and RSMC under identical conditions.

There was no significant change in hemodynamics with HHcy. Veratrine-induced, NO-dependent, coronary vasodilation (Bezold-Jarisch reflex) was reduced by 32% but was restored by simultaneous intravenous infusion of ascorbic acid or apocynin. Acute and chronic HHcy significantly increased uptake of glucose and lactate and decreased uptake of free fatty acid by the heart. HHcy significantly decreased bradykinin- or carbachol-induced reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in vitro, and this effect was completely restored by coincubation with ascorbic acid, Tempol, or apocynin. Western blot analysis indicated an increase in Nox2 (82%) and a reduction in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (39%), phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (39%), and superoxide dismutase-1 (45%). Microarray analysis of gene expression in heart tissue from chronic HHcy indicated a switch in cardiac phenotype to enzymes that metabolize glucose.\nHHcy directly modulates substrate use by the heart independent of changes in hemodynamics or ventricular function by reducing NO bioavailability through the generation of superoxide.

{"title": "Analysis of oxygen transport in a diffusion-limited model of engineered heart tissue.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue engineering has made notable progress in recent years with the advent of an experimental model based on neonatal cardiomyocytes entrapped in collage gels and purified basement membrane extract, known as \"engineered heart tissues\" (EHTs). EHTs are a formidable display of tissue-level contractile function and cellular-level differentiation, although they suffer greatly from mass transport limitations due to the high density of metabolically active cells and the diffusion-limited nature of the hydrogel. In this report, a mathematical model was developed to predict oxygen levels inside a one-dimensional, diffusion-limited model of EHT. These predictions were then compared to values measured in corresponding experiments with a hypoxia-sensitive stain (pimonidazole). EHTs were cast between two plastic discs, which allowed for mass transfer with the culture medium to occur in only the radial direction. EHTs were cultured for up to 36 h in the presence of pimonidazole, after which time they were snap-frozen, histologically sectioned, and stained for bound pimonidazole. Quantitative image analysis was performed to measure the distance from the culture medium at which hypoxia first occurs under various conditions. As tested by variation of simple design parameters, the trends in oxygen profiles predicted by the model are in reasonable agreement with those obtained experimentally, although a number of ambiguities related to the specific model parameters led to a general overprediction of oxygen concentrations.

{"title": "Cardiac tissue Doppler imaging in sports medicine.", "abstract": "The differentiation of training-induced cardiac adaptations from pathological conditions is a key issue in sports cardiology. As morphological features do not allow for a clear delineation of early stages of relevant pathologies, the echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular function is the technique of first choice in this regard. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is a relatively recent method for the assessment of cardiac function that provides direct, local measurements of myocardial velocities throughout the cardiac cycle. Although it has shown a superior sensitivity in the detection of ventricular dysfunction in clinical and experimental studies, its application in sports medicine is still rare. Besides technical factors, this may be due to a lack in consensus on the characteristics of ventricular function in relevant conditions. For more than two decades there has been an ongoing debate on the existence of a supernormal left ventricular function in athlete's heart. While results from traditional echocardiography are conflicting, TDI studies established an improved diastolic function in endurance-trained athletes with athlete's heart compared with controls.The influence of anabolic steroids on cardiac function also has been investigated by standard echocardiographic techniques with inconsistent results. The only TDI study dealing with this topic demonstrated a significantly impaired diastolic function in bodybuilders with long-term abuse of anabolic steroids compared with strength-trained athletes without abuse of anabolic steroids and controls, respectively.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most frequent cause of sudden death in young athletes. However, in its early stages, it is difficult to distinguish from athlete's heart. By means of TDI, ventricular dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be disclosed even before the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Also, a differentiation of left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or systemic hypertension is possible by TDI. Besides the evaluation of different forms of left ventricular hypertrophy, the diagnosis of myocarditis is also of particular importance in athletes. Today, it still requires myocardial biopsy. The analysis of focal disturbances in myocardial velocities might be a promising non-invasive method; however, systematic validation studies are lacking. An important future issue for the implementation of TDI into routine examination will be the standardisation of procedures and the establishment of significant reference values for the above-mentioned conditions.

GLUT-4 translocates to the myocyte surface to increase glucose uptake in response to a number of stimuli. The mechanisms underlying ischemia- and insulin-mediated GLUT-4 translocation are known to be different, raising the possibility that the intracellular destinations of GLUT-4 following these stimuli also differ. Using immunogold labeling, we describe the cellular localization of these two transporters and investigate whether insulin and ischemia induce differential translocation of GLUT-4 to different cardiac membranes. Immunogold labeling of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 was performed on left ventricular sections from isolated hearts following 30 min of either insulin, ischemia, or control perfusion. In control tissue, GLUT-1 was predominantly (76%) localized in the capillary endothelial cells, with only 24% of total cardiac GLUT-1 present in myocytes. GLUT-4 was found predominantly in myocytes, distributed between sarcolemmal and T tubule membranes (1.84 +/- 0.49 and 1.54 +/- 0.33 golds/microm, respectively) and intracellular vesicles (127 +/- 18 golds/microm(2)). Insulin increased T tubule membrane GLUT-4 content (2.8 +/- 0.4 golds/microm, P < 0.05) but had less effect on sarcolemmal GLUT-4 (1.72 +/- 0.53 golds/microm). Ischemia induced greater GLUT-4 translocation to both membrane types (4.25 +/- 0.84 and 4.01 +/- 0.27 golds/microm, respectively P < 0.05).

The concentration of Se in the serum and heart tissue was determined by activation analysis, the serum concentration of NO by chemiluminescence, cardiac concentration of lipofuscin-like pigment by fluorescence analysis. The 10 day-old hearts were perfused (Langendorff); recovery of developed force (DF) was measured after 40 min of global ischemia. In acute experiments, 10 day-old hearts were perfused with selenium (75 nmol/l) before or after global ischemia. Sensitivity to isoproterenol (ISO, pD(50)) was assessed as a response of DF to increasing cumulative dose.Se supplementation elevated serum concentration of Se by 16%. Se increased ischemic tolerance (recovery of DF, 32.28 +/- 2.37 vs. 41.82 +/- 2.91%, P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained after acute administration of Se during post-ischemic reperfusion (32.28 +/- 2.37 vs. 49.73 +/- 4.40%, P < 0.01). The pre-ischemic treatment, however, attenuated the recovery (23.08 +/- 3.04 vs. 32.28 +/- 2.37%, P < 0.05). Moreover, Se supplementation increased the sensitivity to the inotropic effect of ISO, decreased cardiac concentration of lipofuscin-like pigment and serum concentration of NO.

Thirty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: normoxia, and long-term intermittent hypoxia (12% O(2), 8 h per day) for 4 weeks (4WLTIH) or for 8 weeks (8WLTIH). Myocardial morphology, trophic factors and signalling pathways in the three groups were determined by heart weight index, histological analysis, Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from the excised left ventricle. The ratio of whole heart weight to body weight, the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight, the gross vertical cross-section of the heart and myocardial morphological changes were increased in the 4WLTIH group and were further augmented in the 8WLTIH group. In the 4WLTIH group, tumour necrosis factor-alpha(TNFalpha), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT-3 were significantly increased in the cardiac tissues. However, in the 8WLTIH group, in addition to the above factors, interleukin-6, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)5 were significantly increased compared with the normoxia group. We conclude that cardiac hypertrophy associated with TNFalpha and IGF-II was induced by intermittent hypoxia.

Whereas the molecular mechanisms underlying Na/Ca exchanger biophysical properties are widely studied and generally well characterized, the cellular pathways and molecular partners underlying the specialized membrane localization of Na/Ca exchanger in cardiac tissue are essentially unknown. In this report, we present the first direct evidence for a protein pathway required for Na/Ca exchanger localization and stability in primary cardiomyocytes. We define the minimal structural requirements on ankyrin-B for direct Na/Ca exchanger interactions.

Heart I-AnxV uptake was significantly increased in all cardiac territories of LPS-treated rats. In contrast, I-human serum albumin myocardial uptake was only slightly increased in LPS-treated rat hearts, suggesting limited changes in vascular protein permeability. Autoradiography of endotoxin-treated rat heart sections with I-AnxV in association with deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling and caspase 3 staining allows identification of double positive cardiac myocytes. Inhibition of apoptosis by caspase inhibitors (i.e., ZVAD.fmk and DEVD.cmk) reduced I-AnxV myocardial uptake in LPS-treated rats. Eventually, endotoxin-treated rats displayed pathological uptake of Tc-annexin in the cardiac mediastinal region whereas zVAD.fmk reduced Tc-annexin mediastinal uptake.

{"title": "Inferring the cellular origin of voltage and calcium alternans from the spatial scales of phase reversal during discordant alternans.", "abstract": "Beat-to-beat alternation of the action potential duration (APD) in paced cardiac cells has been linked to the onset of lethal arrhythmias. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that alternans at the single cell level can be caused by unstable membrane voltage (V(m)) dynamics linked to steep APD-restitution, or unstable intracellular calcium (Ca) cycling linked to high sensitivity of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load. Identifying which of these two mechanisms is the primary cause of cellular alternans, however, has remained difficult since Ca and V(m) are bidirectionally coupled. Here, we use numerical simulations of a physiologically detailed ionic model to show that the origin of alternans can be inferred by measuring the length scales over which APD and Ca(i) alternans reverse phase during spatially discordant alternans. The main conclusion is that these scales are comparable to a few millimeters and equal when alternans is driven by APD restitution, but differ markedly when alternans is driven predominantly by unstable Ca cycling. In the latter case, APD alternans still reverses phase on a millimeter tissue scale due to electrotonic coupling, while Ca alternans reverses phase on a submillimeter cellular scale.

In the current study, we investigated whether sphingolipid metabolism can account for mediating MAO-A- and reactive oxygen species-dependent cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, MAO-A-dependent reactive oxygen species generation led to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, along with sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) inhibition. These phenomena were associated with generation of proapoptotic ceramide and decrease in prosurvival sphingosine 1-phosphate. These events were mimicked by inhibition of SphK1 with either pharmacological inhibitor or small interfering RNA, as well as by extracellular addition of C(2)-ceramide or H(2)O(2). In contrast, enforced expression of SphK1 protected H9c2 cells from serotonin- or H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Analysis of cardiac tissues from wild-type mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion revealed significant upregulation of ceramide and inhibition of SphK1. It is noteworthy that SphK1 inhibition, ceramide accumulation, and concomitantly infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were significantly decreased in MAO-A-deficient animals. In conclusion, we show for the first time that the upregulation of ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio is a critical event in MAO-A-mediated cardiac cell apoptosis.

Solid tumors were obtained by injecting EMT6 mouse mammary cancer cells intramuscularly into the hind legs of BALB/c mice. Dox-PLN, blank PLN or surfactant formulations were injected intratumorally (IT) when tumors reached approximately 0.3 g.

Cultured adult cardiomyocytes derived from 14-3-3tau(+/-) mice were sensitized to apoptosis in response to hydrogen peroxide or UV irradiation. 14-3-3tau(+/-) mice were intolerant of experimental myocardial infarction and developed pathological ventricular remodeling with increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. ASK1, c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was increased, but extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK activation was reduced, in 14-3-3tau(+/-) cardiac tissue. Inhibition of p38 MAPK increased survival in 14-3-3tau(+/-) mice subjected to myocardial infarction. These results demonstrate that 14-3-3tau plays a critical antiapoptotic function in cardiomyocytes and that therapeutic agents that increase 14-3-3tau activity may be beneficial to patients with myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2006-12-06", "authors": ["Jeffrey M CLau", "XiaohuaJin", "JieRen", "JoanAvery", "Brian JDeBosch", "IlyaTreskov", "Traian SLupu", "AttilaKovacs", "CarlaWeinheimer", "Anthony JMuslin"], "doi": "10.1128/MCB.01369-06"}
{"title": "Evidence dromyosuppressin acts at posterior and anterior pacemakers to decrease the fast and the slow cardiac activity in the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae.", "abstract": "The molecular complexity of the simple blowfly heart makes it an attractive preparation to delineate cardiovascular mechanisms. Blowfly cardiac activity consists of a fast, high-frequency signal phase alternating with a slow, low-frequency signal phase triggered by pacemakers located in the posterior abdominal heart and anterior thoracocephalic aorta, respectively. Mechanisms underlying FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) effects on heart contractions are not well understood. Here, we report antisera generated to a FaRP, dromyosuppressin (DMS, TDVDHVFLRFamide), recognized neuronal processes that innervated the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae heart and aorta. Dromyosuppressin caused a reversible cardiac arrest. High- and low-frequency signals were abolished after which they resumed; however, the concentration-dependent resumption of the fast phase differed from the slow phase. Dromyosuppressin decreased the frequency of cardiac activity in a dose-dependent manner with threshold values between 5 fM and 0.5 fM (fast phase), and 0.5 fM and 0.1 fM (slow phase). Dromyosuppressin structure-activity relationship (SAR) for the decrease of the fast-phase frequency was not the same as the SAR for the decrease of the slow-phase frequency. The alanyl-substituted analog TDVDHVFLAFamide ([Ala9] DMS) was inactive on the fast phase, but active on the slow phase, a novel finding. FaRPs including myosuppressins are reported to require the C-terminal RFamide for activity. Our data are consistent with the conclusions DMS acts on posterior and anterior cardiac tissue to play a role in regulating the fast and slow phases of cardiac activity, respectively, and ligand-receptor binding requirements of the abdominal and thoracocephalic pacemakers are different.", "journal": "Peptides", "date": "2006-12-05", "authors": ["Anna MariaAngioy", "PatriziaMuroni", "Iole TomassiniBarbarossa", "JenniferMcCormick", "RuthannNichols"], "doi": "10.1016/j.peptides.2006.10.015"}

Research in this area has been hampered by the lack of a simple, reproducible method to assess 26S-proteasome peptidase activities. The current report demonstrates that one reason for lack of reproducibility is the myriad of ATP concentrations, many of them excessive, which have been used to stimulate peptidase activity. The chymotrypsin-like or caspase-like activities of 26S-proteasome in cardiac tissue isolates were determined using Suc-LLVY-AMC or Z-LLE-AMC, respectively, over a range of ATP concentrations up to 2 mmol/L. The optimal ATP concentration to assess both peptidase activities was found to be in the low micromolar range (from 6 to 100 micromol/L) depending on the cardiac tissue isolate protein (10 to 90 microg protein) contained in the reaction. Increasing ATP beyond the optimal range was inhibitory. In general, chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities could be stimulated 2- to 2.5-fold and 1.4- to 1.8-fold, respectively, over basal (ATP, 0 micromol/L), and could be effectively inhibited with lactacystin or Z-Pro-Nle-Asp-CHO, respectively.

The present study shows that force production of cardiac strips from the cavum arteriosum and cavum pulmonale exhibits similar force production when stimulated in vitro. The high systemic blood pressure is caused, therefore, by a thicker ventricular wall surrounding the cavum arteriosum rather than differences in the intrinsic properties of the cardiac tissues. Similarly, there were no differences between the contractile properties of right and left atria. Force production was similar in atria and ventricle but the atria contracted and relaxed much faster than the ventricle. Graded hypoxia markedly reduced twitch force of all four cardiac tissues, and this was most pronounced when PO(2) was below 40 kPa. In contrast, the four cardiac tissues were insensitive to acidosis during normoxia although acidosis increased the sensitivity to hypoxia. Adrenergic stimulation increased twitch force of all cardiac tissues, while cholinergic stimulation only affected the atria and reduced twitch force markedly. In spite of the different oxygen availability of the two sides of the heart, the biochemical and functional properties are alike and the differences may instead be overcome by the coronary blood supply.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Pre-column derivatization of the sample with 7-fluoro-4-nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD-F) allowed both effective in-line pre-concentration and sensitive MS/MS detection of the analytes. An extraction column (50x0.25 mm, 5 microm C18 silica particles) was used to pre-concentrate/stack samples.

{"title": "A spatial and temporal map of FGF/Erk1/2 activity and response repertoires in the early chick embryo.", "abstract": "During early vertebrate development Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signalling is required for multiple activities including specification of mesodermal, neural and heart tissue, as well as gastrulation movements and regulation of differentiation and pattern onset in the extending body axis. A current challenge is to understand how FGF signalling generates such diverse outcomes. A key FGF downstream pathway is the Ras-MAPK/Erk1/2 cascade, which culminates in the phosphorylation of target proteins, such as the Ets family of transcription factors. To begin to assess specificity downstream of FGF in the chick embryo we have characterised the patterns of Fgfr1-4 expression and Erk1/2 activation, as well as expression of the Erk1/2 specific phosphatase, Mkp3 and of three Ets factor genes (Erm, Pea3 and Er81) from early blastula to the 10 somite stage. We identify new sites of Fgfr expression and show that nearly all regions of Erk1/2 activity are within Fgfr expression domains and require FGF signalling. Differences in intensity, duration, distribution and sub-cellular localisation of activated Erk1/2 are observed in distinct cell populations within the embryo and during wound healing. With few exceptions, a tight correspondence between Erk1/2 activation and Mkp3 expression is found, while specific combinations of Ets factors are associated with distinct regions of Erk1/2 activation. These findings provide a comprehensive spatial and temporal map of FGF/Erk1/2 activity during early chick development and identify region and tissue specific differences in expression of Fgfrs as well as Erk1/2 phosphorylation and transcriptional targets which help to define response specificity.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2006-11-25", "authors": ["J SimonLunn", "Katherine JFishwick", "Pam AHalley", "Kate GStorey"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.10.014"}
{"title": "Multiple functions of Cerberus cooperate to induce heart downstream of Nodal.", "abstract": "The TGFbeta family member Nodal has been implicated in heart induction through misexpression of a dominant negative version of the type I Nodal receptor (Alk4) and targeted deletion of the co-receptor Cripto in murine ESCs and mouse embryos; however, whether Nodal acts directly or indirectly to induce heart tissue or interacts with other signaling molecules or pathways remained unclear. Here we present Xenopus embryological studies demonstrating an unforeseen role for the DAN family protein Cerberus within presumptive foregut endoderm as essential for differentiation of cardiac mesoderm in response to Nodal. Ectopic activation of Nodal signaling in non-cardiogenic ventroposterior mesendoderm, either by misexpression of the Nodal homologue XNr1 together with Cripto or by a constitutively active Alk4 (caAlk4), induced both cardiac markers and Cerberus. Mosaic lineage tracing studies revealed that Nodal/Cripto and caAlk4 induced cardiac markers cell non-autonomously, thus supporting the idea that Cerberus or another diffusible factor is an essential mediator of Nodal-induced cardiogenesis. Cerberus alone was found sufficient to initiate cardiogenesis at a distance from its site of synthesis. Conversely, morpholino-mediated specific knockdown of Cerberus reduced both endogenous cardiomyogenesis and ectopic heart induction resulting from misactivation of Nodal/Cripto signaling. Since the specific knockdown of Cerberus did not abrogate heart induction by the Wnt antagonist Dkk1, Nodal/Cripto and Wnt antagonists appear to initiate cardiogenesis through distinct pathways. This idea was further supported by the combinatorial effect of morpholino-medicated knockdown of Cerberus and Hex, which is required for Dkk1-induced cardiogenesis, and the differential roles of essential downstream effectors: Nodal pathway activation did not induce the transcriptional repressor Hex while Dkk-1 did not induce Cerberus. These studies demonstrated that cardiogenesis in mesoderm depends on Nodal-mediated induction of Cerberus in underlying endoderm, and that this pathway functions in a pathway parallel to cardiogenesis initiated through the induction of Hex by Wnt antagonists. Both pathways operate in endoderm to initiate cardiogenesis in overlying mesoderm.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2006-11-25", "authors": ["Ann CFoley", "OksanaKorol", "Anjuli MTimmer", "MarkMercola"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.10.033"}
{"title": "Effect of dietary hempseed intake on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have significant, cardioprotective effects against ischemia. Hempseed contains a high proportion of the PUFAs linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which may have opposing effects on postischemic heart performance. There are no reported data concerning the cardiovascular effects of dietary hempseed intake. A group of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were distributed evenly into four groups that were fed for 12 wk a normal rat chow supplemented with hempseed (5% and 10%), palm oil (1%), or a 10% partially delipidated hempseed that served as a control. Plasma ALA and gamma-linolenic acid levels were significantly elevated in the rats that were fed a 5% or 10% hempseed-supplemented diet, but in heart tissue only ALA levels were significantly elevated in the rats fed these diets compared with control. After the dietary interventions were completed, postischemic heart performance was evaluated by measuring developed tension, resting tension, the rates of tension development and relaxation, and the number of extrasystoles. Hearts from rats fed a hempseed-supplemented diet exhibited significantly better postischemic recovery of maximal contractile function and enhanced rates of tension development and relaxation during reperfusion than hearts from the other groups. These hearts, however, were not protected from the occurrence of extrasystoles, nor were the increases in resting tension altered during ischemia or reperfusion as a function of any dietary intervention. Our data demonstrate that dietary hempseed can provide significant cardioprotective effects during postischemic reperfusion.

{"title": "Deficiency of TNFR1 protects myocardium through SOCS3 and IL-6 but not p38 MAPK or IL-1beta.", "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in the development of heart failure. There is a direct correlation between myocardial function and myocardial TNF levels in humans. TNF may induce local inflammation to exert tissue injury. On the other hand, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins have been shown to inhibit proinflammatory signaling. However, it is unknown whether TNF mediates myocardial inflammation via STAT3/SOCS3 signaling in the heart and, if so, whether this effect is through the type 1 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNFR1). We hypothesized that TNFR1 deficiency protects myocardial function and decreases myocardial IL-6 production via the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in response to TNF. Isolated male mouse hearts (n = 4/group) from wild-type (WT) and TNFR1 knockout (TNFR1KO) were subjected to direct TNF infusion (500 pg.ml(-1).min(-1) x 30 min) while left ventricular developed pressure and maximal positive and negative values of the first derivative of pressure were continuously recorded. Heart tissue was analyzed for active forms of STAT3, p38, SOCS3 and SOCS1 (Western blot analysis), as well as IL-1beta and IL-6 (ELISA). Coronary effluent was analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. As a result, TNFR1KO had significantly better myocardial function, less myocardial LDH release, and greater expression of SOCS3 (percentage of SOCS3/GAPDH: 45 +/- 4.5% vs. WT 22 +/- 6.5%) after TNF infusion. TNFR1 deficiency decreased STAT3 activation (percentage of phospho-STAT3/STAT3: 29 +/- 6.4% vs. WT 45 +/- 8.8%). IL-6 was decreased in TNFR1KO (150.2 +/- 3.65 pg/mg protein) versus WT (211.4 +/- 26.08) mice. TNFR1 deficiency did not change expression of p38 and IL-1beta following TNF infusion.

{"title": "Action potential duration dispersion and alternans in simulated heterogeneous cardiac tissue with a structural barrier.", "abstract": "Structural barriers to wave propagation in cardiac tissue are associated with a decreased threshold for repolarization alternans both experimentally and clinically. Using computer simulations, we investigated the effects of a structural barrier on the onset of spatially concordant and discordant alternans. We used two-dimensional tissue geometry with heterogeneity in selected potassium conductances to mimic known apex-base gradients. Although we found that the actual onset of alternans was similar with and without the structural barrier, the increase in alternans magnitude with faster pacing was steeper with the barrier--giving the appearance of an earlier alternans onset in its presence. This is consistent with both experimental structural barrier findings and the clinical observation of T-wave alternans occurring at slower pacing rates in patients with structural heart disease. In ionically homogeneous tissue, discordant alternans induced by the presence of the structural barrier arose at intermediate pacing rates due to a source-sink mismatch behind the barrier. In heterogeneous tissue, discordant alternans occurred during fast pacing due to a barrier-induced decoupling of tissue with different restitution properties. Our results demonstrate a causal relationship between the presence of a structural barrier and increased alternans magnitude and action potential duration dispersion, which may contribute to why patients with structural heart disease are at higher risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2006-11-23", "authors": ["TrineKrogh-Madsen", "David JChristini"], "doi": "10.1529/biophysj.106.090845"}

We examined the histopathological and biochemical effects of melatonin on the epirubicin-induced changes and measured the levels of the lipid peroxidation end-product (malondialdehyde, MDA), an indicator of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (nitrite/nitrate production), and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the heart. We also studied the extracellular matrix components (fibronectin, laminin) in the heart. Vacuole formation, mitochondrial deformation and degeneration, and disordered myofibrillary structures were detected ultrastructurally in the epirubicin-treated group. The degeneration was reduced in the heart tissues of the epirubicin+melatonin group. Epirubicin increased the nitrite/nitrate production, but did not change the MDA and GSH levels significantly. Melatonin treatment lowered the nitrite/nitrate concentrations, while increasing the GSH levels, which exceeded the levels in epirubicin+melatonin-treated rats. We conclude that the epirubicin increased the nitrozative stress, not the oxidative stress, in heart tissue, and the cardioprotective effect of melatonin was partially attributed to the suppression of epirubicin-induced nitrozative stress.

{"title": "Prevention of angiotensin II-induced cardiac remodeling by angiotensin-(1-7).", "abstract": "Cardiac remodeling, which typically results from chronic hypertension or following an acute myocardial infarction, is a major risk factor for the development of heart failure and, ultimately, death. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has previously been established to play an important role in the progression of cardiac remodeling, and inhibition of a hyperactive RAS provides protection from cardiac remodeling and subsequent heart failure. Our previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) prevents cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy during chronic infusion of angiotensin II (ANG II). This, coupled with the knowledge that ACE2 is a key enzyme in the formation of ANG-(1-7), led us to hypothesize that chronic infusion of ANG-(1-7) would prevent cardiac remodeling induced by chronic infusion of ANG II. Infusion of ANG II into adult Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in significantly increased blood pressure, myocyte hypertrophy, and midmyocardial interstitial fibrosis. Coinfusion of ANG-(1-7) resulted in significant attenuations of myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, without significant effects on blood pressure. In a subgroup of animals also administered [d-Ala(7)]-ANG-(1-7) (A779), an antagonist to the reported receptor for ANG-(1-7), there was a tendency to attenuate the antiremodeling effects of ANG-(1-7). Chronic infusion of ANG II, with or without coinfusion of ANG-(1-7), had no effect on ANG II type 1 or type 2 receptor binding in cardiac tissue. Together, these findings indicate an antiremodeling role for ANG-(1-7) in cardiac tissue, which is not mediated through modulation of blood pressure or altered cardiac angiotensin receptor populations and may be at least partially mediated through an ANG-(1-7) receptor.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

To this end neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultivated in PEGylated fibrinogen constructs. The cell-seeding density and biomaterial composition were optimized to obtain maximum spontaneous contraction of the constructs. Quantitative characterization of the contraction pattern was accomplished by video image analysis. It was possible to demonstrate an inverse correlation between the material stiffness and the amplitude of contraction of the tissue constructs by changing the modulus of the matrix using different compositions of PEG and fibrinogen. The relationship between matrix stiffness, cell density and tissue contraction also provided some insight into the mechanism of cellular remodeling that ultimately leads to synchronized contraction of the constructs.

However, the pathophysiological mechanism accounting for the slight decrease in MIBG uptake in MSA remains to be elucidated. For confirmation, we examined cardiac tissue and sympathetic ganglia from patients with MSA. We immunohistochemically examined each specimen of 15 patients with MSA together with 10 control subjects using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neurofilament (NF). The number of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium was preserved in 8 of 15 patients with MSA as well as in 10 control subjects. The number of TH-immunoreactive, but not of NF-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium was mildly or moderately decreased in six patients with MSA, of whom four showed a decrease of TH immunoreactivity in the neuronal somata in the sympathetic ganglia. Moreover, TH- and NF-immunoreactive nerve fibers almost entirely disappeared in the heart of one patient with MSA, in whom Lewy body pathology was present in the sympathetic ganglia. These findings suggest that mild degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve can occur in MSA which is closely related to the pathological change of neurons in the sympathetic ganglia, accounting for the slight decrease in cardiac uptake of MIBG.

{"title": "Dynamic origin of spatially discordant alternans in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Alternans, a condition in which there is a beat-to-beat alternation in the electromechanical response of a periodically stimulated cardiac cell, has been linked to the genesis of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Optical mapping of membrane voltage (V(m)) and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) on the surface of animal hearts reveals complex spatial patterns of alternans. In particular, spatially discordant alternans has been observed in which regions with a large-small-large action potential duration (APD) alternate out-of-phase adjacent to regions of small-large-small APD. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to the initiation of discordant alternans and govern its spatiotemporal properties are not well understood. Using mathematical modeling, we show that dynamic changes in the spatial distribution of discordant alternans can be used to pinpoint the underlying mechanisms. Optical mapping of V(m) and Ca(i) in paced rabbit hearts revealed that spatially discordant alternans induced by rapid pacing exhibits properties consistent with a purely dynamical mechanism as shown in theoretical studies.

{"title": "Chronic angiotensin II stimulation in the heart produces an acquired long QT syndrome associated with IK1 potassium current downregulation.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It predisposes patients to heart failure, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts direct actions on cardiac tissue inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and electro-mechanical dysfunction. However, a direct association between Ang II and cardiomyocyte electrical remodeling has yet to be demonstrated. Transgenic TG1306/1R (TG) mice with cardiac-specific Ang II overproduction demonstrate blood pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy and exhibit significant increase in sudden death associated with mechanical dysfunction. The present study makes use of TG mice to evaluate the direct effects of high levels of intracardiac Ang II on cardiac electrophysiology. Surface-limb ECG measurements were recorded on 50- to 60-week-old TG and wild-type (WT) mice. QT interval was significantly prolonged (+20%) in TG mice relative to WT. TG mice also showed an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. QT prolongation was associated with prolongation of cardiomyocyte action potential at 90% repolarization (APD90). The change in APD90 correlated with a reduction in IK1 potassium current density in TG vs. WT cardiomyocytes (at -70 mV: 0.3+/-0.1 pA/pF vs. 0.8+/-0.2 pA/pF, P<0.05). In TG mice, reduction in IK1 was associated with a significant reduction (-50%) of the mRNA encoding Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 subunits of IK1-related KCNJ2 and KCNJ12 potassium channels. These data suggest that cardiac Ang II overproduction leads to the emergence of a long QT syndrome resulting from an IK1-dependent prolongation of the action potential duration through modulation of channel subunit expression.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2006-10-31", "authors": ["Andrea ADomenighetti", "ChristopheBoixel", "DanielCefai", "HuguesAbriel", "ThierryPedrazzini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2006.09.019"}

To test our ability to obtain high quality RNA from biopsy-sized cardiac specimens, amplification was performed on RNA from biopsy-sized samples of left ventricle (LV) tissue from one explanted failing human heart and one non-failing heart. Two methods were used: one-cycle (1C) amplification of 1.6 microg of RNA, and two-cycle (2C) amplification of 50 ng of RNA. The resulting cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Over 65% of all differentially expressed genes for failing vs non-failing hearts were concordant between 1C and 2C RNA amplification. Differentially expressed genes between 1C and 2C RNA amplification in our study were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.957 and changes in gene expression agreed with prior studies on genes and heart failure; e.g., decreased alpha-myosin heavy chain and alpha-tropomyosin, as well as increased expression of insulin-like growth factor). Two cycles of amplification from cardiac biopsies will permit accurate transcription profiling of heart failure at pre-symptomatic stages.

{"title": "ACE2 of the heart: From angiotensin I to angiotensin (1-7).", "abstract": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), a bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the Ang II forming enzyme, or specific blockade of Ang II binding to angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) through which it exerts its deleterious effects, were shown to provide some protection against progression of CVD. The ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis has been challenged over the last few years with RAAS components able to counterbalance the effects of the main axis. The ACE homologue ACE2 efficiently hydrolyses Ang II to form Ang (1-7), a peptide that exerts actions opposite to those of Ang II. In contrast to the Ang II axis, the role of the ACE2-Ang (1-7) axis in cardiac function is largely obscure. Ang (1-7) is present in the viable myocardium, and its formation depends on Ang II as a substrate. The expression of this peptide is associated with cardiac remodeling: it is lost in the infarcted area and significantly increased in the border area. Low doses of Ang (1-7) improve cardiac output and antagonize Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. The type of Ang (1-7) biological activity is tissue specific and dose dependent. These findings point to a possible protective role for Ang (1-7) in abating the Ang II-induced actions. The elevated expression of Ang (1-7) in failing heart tissue paralleled the expression of its forming enzyme, ACE2. Several observations and experimental evidence suggest a beneficial role for ACE2 in cardiovascular function. Elevated ACE2 expression at the initial stage of several pathologies which decline with progression of disease might indicate a protective role for ACE2. Genetic manipulation of ACE2 expression, either targeted disruption or overexpression, point to the possible significance of this enzyme in cardiac function. Based on the above, a therapeutic approach that will amplify the ACE2-Ang (1-7) axis could provide further protection against the development of CVD. It turns out that the merits of currently used drugs--ACE inhibitors, AT1R blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRB) - lay beyond their direct effects on suppression of the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis as they also increase cardiac ACE2 and Ang (1-7) significantly.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2006-10-20", "authors": ["ShlomoKeidar", "MarielleKaplan", "AvivaGamliel-Lazarovich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.09.006"}

This study hypothesized that implantation of a BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffold into the epicardial surface in a rat MI model would be biocompatible, induce BMMNC migration into infarcted myocardium, and effectively improve left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. One week after the implantation of a BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffold, BMMMC showed migration into the epicardial region. Four weeks after implantation, augmented neovascularization was observed in infarcted areas and in infarct border zones. Some BMMNCs exhibited the presence of alpha-MHC and troponin I, markers of differentiation into cardiomyocytes. In echocardiographic examinations, BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffold and non-cell-seeded simple PGCL scaffold groups effectively reduced progressive LV dilatation and preserved LV systolic function as compared to control rat MI groups. Thus, BMMNC-seeded PGCL scaffolding influences BMMNC migration, differentiation to cardiomyocytes, and induction of neovascularization, ultimately effectively lessening LV remodeling and progressive LV systolic dysfunction.

{"title": "Vanadium distribution, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress markers upon decavanadate in vivo administration.", "abstract": "The contribution of decameric vanadate species to vanadate toxic effects in cardiac muscle was studied following an intravenous administration of a decavanadate solution (1mM total vanadium) in Sparus aurata. Although decameric vanadate is unstable in the assay medium, it decomposes with a half-life time of 16 allowing studying its effects not only in vitro but also in vivo. After 1, 6 and 12h upon decavanadate administration the increase of vanadium in blood plasma, red blood cells and in cardiac mitochondria and cytosol is not affected in comparison to the administration of a metavanadate solution containing labile oxovanadates. Cardiac tissue lipid peroxidation increases up to 20%, 1, 6 and 12h after metavanadate administration, whilst for decavanadate no effects were observed except 1h after treatment (+20%). Metavanadate administration clearly differs from decavanadate by enhancing, 12h after exposure, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (+115%) and not affecting catalase (CAT) activity whereas decavanadate increases SOD activity by 20% and decreases (-55%) mitochondrial CAT activity. At early times of exposure, 1 and 6h, the only effect observed upon decavanadate administration was the increase by 20% of SOD activity. In conclusion, decavanadate has a different response pattern of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress markers, in spite of the same vanadium distribution in cardiac cells observed after decavanadate and metavanadate administration. It is suggested that once formed decameric vanadate species has a different reactivity than vanadate, thus, pointing out that the differential contribution of vanadium oligomers should be taken into account to rationalize in vivo vanadate toxicity.", "journal": "Journal of inorganic biochemistry", "date": "2006-10-13", "authors": ["S SSoares", "HMartins", "R ODuarte", "J J GMoura", "JCoucelo", "CGuti\u00e9rrez-Merino", "MAureliano"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2006.08.002"}

This study aimed to detect cardiac aldosterone by use of a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric method and to assess the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade on hypertensive DHF. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 8% NaCl diet from 7 wk (hypertensive DHF model) were divided at 13 wk into three groups: those treated with subdepressor doses of eplerenone (12.5 or 40 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) and an untreated group. Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 0.3% NaCl diet served as controls. Cardiac aldosterone was detected in the DHF rats but not in the control rats, with increased ventricular levels of mineralocorticoid receptor. Cardiac levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 11-dehydrocorticosterone were not different between the control and DHF rats, but the tissue level of corticosterone that has an affinity to mineralocorticoid receptor was 1,000 times as high as that of aldosterone. Aldosterone synthase activity and CYP11B2 mRNA were undetectable in the ventricular tissue of the DHF rats. Administration of eplerenone attenuated ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular fibrosis, myocardial stiffening, and relaxation abnormality, leading to the prevention of overt DHF. In summary, the myocardial aldosterone level increased in the DHF rats. However, its value was extremely low compared with corticosterone, and no evidence for enhancement of intrinsic myocardial aldosterone production was found. The upregulation of mineralocorticoid receptor may play a central role in the pathogenesis of DHF, and blockade of mineralocorticoid receptor is likely an effective therapeutic regimen of DHF.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "The impact of hypoxia on in vivo glucose uptake in a hypoglycemic fish, Myoxocephalus scorpius.", "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling carbohydrate utilization in teleost fish are poorly understood, particularly in the heart. Tissue glucose uptake and cardiovascular characteristics were measured in the short-horned sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius, a species exhibiting low blood glucose levels, during normoxia and hypoxia to assess the role of adenosine receptors in the control of glucose uptake and anaerobic metabolism. As expected, hypoxia exposure (300 min at 2 mg/l dissolved oxygen) resulted in a bradycardia and plasma lactate accumulation, but glucose uptake rates did not change in heart, brain, gill, spleen, and white muscle. Plasma glucose-to-intracellular glucose ratios indicated that glucose uptake was the rate-limiting step in glucose utilization. The majority of intracellular glucose was unphosphorylated, however, suggesting that hexokinase is also important in controlling the tissue glucose gradient. During hypoxia, the cholinergic blocker atropine resulted in tachycardia but did not significantly change tissue glucose uptake rates or heart and brain adenosine levels. In contrast, the combined treatment of atropine and an adenosine receptor blocker [8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline] during hypoxia increased heart glucose uptake to levels fivefold higher than normoxic fish, with no additive effects on cardiovascular parameters. Significant tissue lactate accumulation was observed in this group of fish, signifying that adenosine receptors may depress anaerobic metabolism, even though tissue adenosine accumulation was absent during hypoxia. White muscle accumulated glucose during normoxia, suggesting the presence of gluconeogenic pathways or active uptake mechanisms not previously described in this tissue.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "C2C12 skeletal muscle cells adopt cardiac-like sodium current properties in a cardiac cell environment.", "abstract": "Intracardiac transplantation of undifferentiated skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) has emerged as a promising therapy for myocardial infarct repair and is already undergoing clinical trials. The fact that cells originating from skeletal muscle have different electrophysiological properties than cardiomyocytes, however, may considerably limit the success of this therapy and, in addition, cause side effects. Indeed, a major problem observed after myoblast transplantation is the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The most often transient nature of these arrhythmias may suggest that, once transplanted into cardiac tissue, skeletal muscle cells adopt more cardiac-like electrophysiological properties. To test whether a cardiac cell environment can indeed modify electrophysiological parameters of skeletal muscle cells, we treated mouse C(2)C(12) myocytes with medium preconditioned by primary cardiocytes and compared their functional sodium current properties with those of control cells. We found this treatment to significantly alter the activation and inactivation properties of sodium currents from \"skeletal muscle\" to more \"cardiac\"-like ones. Sodium currents of cardiac-conditioned cells showed a reduced sensitivity to block by tetrodotoxin. These findings and reverse transcription PCR experiments suggest that an upregulation of the expression of the cardiac sodium channel isoform Na(v)1.5 versus the skeletal muscle isoform Na(v)1.4 is responsible for the observed changes in sodium current function. We conclude that cardiomyocytes alter sodium channel isoform expression of skeletal muscle cells via a paracrine mechanism.

However, the mechanisms by which transplanted cells might help to promote repair of cardiac tissue are not understood and might involve processes different from the differentiation of transplanted cells into cardiomyocytes. We have compared the effects exerted by skeletal myoblasts (which are not able to form new cardiomyocytes) and ESC-derived cardiomyocytes after implantation into infarcted mouse hearts by echocardiographic follow-up and histological analysis and related these effects to the release of cardioactive cytokines. We found that both cell types led to a long-lasting improvement of left ventricle function and to an improvement of tissue architecture. Since no relevant amounts of myoblast-derived cells were present in infarcted hearts 28 days after transplantation, we investigated the release of cytokines from implanted cells both before and after transplantation into infarcted hearts. ESC-derived cardiomyocytes and myoblasts secreted substantial amounts of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-beta, and oncostatin M, which strongly supported survival and protein synthesis of cultured cardiomyocytes.

It is highly cardiac-specific (i.e. expressed primarily in cardiac tissue), but is also expressed at low concentrations in tissues outside the heart. After myocardial ischemic damage, hFABP can be detected in the blood as early as 1-3 h after onset of chest pain, with peak values reached at 6-8 h and plasma levels returning to normal within 24-30 h. hFABP's clinical diagnostic value is very limited in the presence of renal failure and skeletal muscle diseases as it is completely renally eliminated. In these conditions, the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be overestimated. The combination of initial hFABP release after symptom onset, rapid kidney clearance from the circulation and high cardiac specificity suggests great potential for clinical use. Serial measurements of hFABP in the first 24 h after onset of symptoms in AMI patients can: (a) identify patients who are susceptible to reperfusion strategies, (b) detect perioperative AMIs, (c) distinguish patients who reperfuse their infarct-related artery from those who do not, as early as 30 min after starting thrombolytic treatment, (d) detect re-infarction if it occurs within 10 h after symptom onset, and (e) permit an accurate estimation of myocardial infarct size providing important prognosis information.", "journal": "Cardiology", "date": "2006-09-09", "authors": ["AndreaColli", "MiguelJosa", "Jose LuisPomar", "Carlos AlbertoMestres", "TizianoGherli"], "doi": "10.1159/000095594"}

Thus we used a computer modeling approach to study the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction induced by mutations in inward rectifier potassium channel (K(ir))2.1 that cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS). ATS is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with ventricular arrhythmias that uncommonly degenerate into the lethal arrhythmia torsade de pointes. We simulated the cellular and tissue effects of a potent disease-causing mutation D71V K(ir)2.1 with mathematical models of human ventricular myocytes and a bidomain model of transmural conduction. The D71V K(ir)2.1 mutation caused significant action potential duration prolongation in subendocardial, midmyocardial, and subepicardial myocytes but did not significantly increase transmural dispersion of repolarization. Simulations of the D71V mutation at shorter cycle lengths induced stable action potential alternans in midmyocardial, but not subendocardial or subepicardial cells. The action potential alternans was manifested as an abbreviated QRS complex in the transmural ECG, the result of action potential propagation failure in the midmyocardial tissue. In addition, our simulations of D71V mutation recapitulate several key ECG features of ATS, including QT prolongation, T-wave flattening, and QRS widening.

Cardiac function was measured by Langendorff model in sham and burn rats given either vitamins or vehicle. Twenty-four hours postburn, mitochondrial outer membrane damage was progressively increased to approximately 50%, and cytosolic cytochrome-c gradually accumulated to approximately three times more than that measured in shams, indicating impaired mitochondrial integrity. Maximal decrease of mitochondrial SOD activity occurred 8 h postburn ( approximately 63.5% of shams), whereas maximal decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity persisted 2-24 h postburn ( approximately 60% of shams). In burn animals, lipid peroxidation in cardiac mitochondria increased 30-50%, suggesting burn-induced oxidative stress.

Infarcted tissue (INF) can typically appear a mottled tan to brownish color, making a border between INF and TTC-positive tissue difficult to discern. Previous work in our lab indicated that following TTC staining, prolonged washing of thick sections dramatically sharpened this boundary.\nAdult rats underwent 30 min ischemia via LAD ligation and reperfusion/recovery over 24 h. Hearts were then harvested, thick-sectioned, and stained with TTC. Stained sections were stored in PBS at 4 degrees C for up to 3 weeks.\nHistology on thin sections from infarcted hearts fixed directly after harvest revealed extensive hemorrhage within the INF. However, this hemorrhage is washed out when hearts are stored in PBS for 3 weeks. SDS-PAGE of PBS samples taken at 1, 2, and 3 weeks showed a low molecular weight band appearing over time. Peptide sequencing revealed the presence of several proteins including the heme-containing proteins (HCPs) hemoglobin, cytochrome c, and myoglobin. The loss of HCPs from thick sections to PBS corresponded with the blanching of the previously mottled INF within each section. HPLC analysis of these samples confirmed the loss of HCPs contributes to INF whitening. Further, analysis of infarct size values derived from heart slices with or without HCPs showed a significant decrease in measurement error when values were derived from slices without HCPs.\nThese data suggest that HCPs in the heart tissue contribute to the non-uniform and discolored appearance of the INF, and that washout of these proteins produces an INF more easily distinguished from neighboring non-infarcted tissue.

{"title": "Atorvastatin has cardiac safety at intensive cholesterol-reducing protocols for long term, yet its cancer-treatment doses with chemotherapy may cause cardiomyopathy even under coenzyme-Q10 protection.", "abstract": "Statins provide strong clinical benefits via reducing stroke deaths, and they are also considered for tumor reduction and chemo-sensitization. High dose atorvastatin in adults (80 mg daily, approx. 1 mg/kg) is proven to afford greater protection against cardiac deaths than does a standard lipid-lowering dose in coronary syndrome. For cancer trials, mega doses up to 30 mg/kg have been used for short term treatments but neither a high nor a mega-dose of atorvastatin has been tested for long term cardiac safety. This may be of special concern, since some animal studies showed deleterious effects of statins on cardiac tissue, which may be related with coenzymeQ (CoQ) depletion. We performed an electron microscopic analysis of rat hearts after low, high-or mega-dose atorvastatin therapy and with or without MNU (methyl-nitrosourea)-stress. MNU + daily high dose atorvastatin treatment for 13 months did not produce severe cardiac toxicity with CoQ. However, at mega doses (30 mg/kg) and with MNU, mitochondrial damage and myofibrillary disintegration was obvious. Strong proliferation of mitochondria under high dose atorvastatin therapy with CoQ may explain the lack of cardiotoxicity; and this finding seems to parallel recent data that statins induce HNF-4 and PPAR-alpha, both responsible for mitochondria-proliferation. Employment of statins for tumor chemo-sensitization at high-dosage and for long term treatments may require strategies to direct the mevalonate-entry differentially into cardiac and tumor cells and to develop a protocol analogous to folic acid salvage of methotrexate toxicity.", "journal": "Cell biochemistry and function", "date": "2006-08-15", "authors": ["MetinCaner", "BingurSonmez", "OzlemKurnaz", "CanerAldemir", "SedaSalar", "TuncayAltug", "AyhanBilir", "Meric AAltinoz"], "doi": "10.1002/cbf.1356"}
{"title": "Clinical and immunologic characteristics in peripartum cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare disorder of dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction occurring in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum. Outcome of PPCM is highly variable, comprising clinical improvement and rapid deterioration unresponsive to medical treatment requiring heart transplantation or even death. In this study, we report the clinicopathologic findings of 10 patients with PPCM who were retrospectively identified in our cardiomyopathy registry. During a follow-up of 69+/-27 months, no patient died or required orthotopic heart transplantation. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 38+/-7% at the time of diagnosis and 53+/-7% during follow-up. While all patients had sinus rhythm at the time of diagnosis, three patients presented with left bundle branch block. We found no evidence of viral infection in endomyocardial biopsy samples of seven patients by PCR. Histopathologic findings revealed the presence borderline myocarditis in two of seven patients (29%). Circulating autoantibodies to cardiac tissue of any kind were observed in all patients. In conclusion, in our retrospective observational study, no patient diagnosed with PPCM died or received orthotopic heart transplantation. Improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction was present in eight patients (80%), while LV dysfunction persisted in four patients. Our findings support the hypothesis of an underlying autoimmune pathomechanism in this rare disease.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2006-08-15", "authors": ["SteffenLamparter", "SabinePankuweit", "BernhardMaisch"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.04.090"}

We report a novel finding in the TGFbeta inducible early gene (TIEG) null mouse implicating TIEG1 in cardiac hypertrophy. The TIEG(-/-) knock-out mouse was studied. Male mice age 4-16 months were characterized (N = 86 total) using echocardiography, transcript profiling by gene microarray, and immunohistochemistry localized upregulated genes for determination of cellular mechanism. The female mice (N = 40) did not develop hypertrophy or fibrosis. The TIEG(-/-) knock-out mouse developed features of cardiac hypertrophy including asymmetric septal hypertrophy, an increase in ventricular size at age 16 months, an increase (214%) in mouse heart/weight body weight ratio TIEG(-/-), and an increase in wall thickness in TIEG(-/-) mice of (1.85 +/- 0.21 mm), compared to the control (1.13 +/- 0.15 mm, P < 0.04). Masson Trichrome staining demonstrated evidence of myocyte disarray and myofibroblast fibrosis. Microarray analysis of the left ventricles demonstrated that TIEG(-/-) heart tissues expressed a 13.81-fold increase in pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 (Pttg1). An increase in Pttg1 and histone H3 protein levels were confirmed in the TIEG(-/-) mice hearts tissues. We present evidence implicating TIEG and possibly its target gene, Pttg1, in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in the TIEG null mouse.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2006-08-05", "authors": ["Nalini MRajamannan", "MalayannanSubramaniam", "Theodore PAbraham", "Vlad CVasile", "Michael JAckerman", "David GMonroe", "Teng-LeongChew", "Thomas CSpelsberg"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.21049"}
{"title": "Construction of multi-layered cardiomyocyte sheets using magnetite nanoparticles and magnetic force.", "abstract": "Heart tissue engineering requires construction of three-dimensional (3-D) tissues composed of cardiomyocytes (CMs) that are tightly connected to each other. The aim of this study was to construct \"scaffold-less\" multi-layered 3-D CM sheets using magnetic force-based tissue engineering (Mag-TE) and to evaluate the cell-to-cell functional connections within the CM sheets. Original magnetite cationic liposomes (MCLs) with a positive surface charge (which facilitate adsorption to the target cell surface) were taken up by CMs that were isolated from 2-day-old Wistar rats. When MCLs were added to the medium of CMs at magnetite concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 pg per cell, subsequent measurements showed that 7.2, 13.2, and 27.3 pg of magnetite were taken up per cell, respectively, after 4 h incubation at 37 degrees C. Further, no toxicity was observed after a 24 h incubation period. Using magnetically labeled CMs (magnetite concentration, 100 pg/cell), multi-layered CM sheets were constructed. Immunofluorescent staining of connexin43 demonstrated the presence of gap junctions within the CM sheets that were constructed by Mag-TE. Moreover, electrical connections within the CM sheets constructed by Mag-TE were confirmed using extracellular potential mapping. These results indicate that Mag-TE is a viable methodology for heart tissue engineering.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2006-07-26", "authors": ["KazunoriShimizu", "AkiraIto", "Jong-KookLee", "TatsuroYoshida", "KeikoMiwa", "HisaakiIshiguro", "YasushiNumaguchi", "ToyoakiMurohara", "ItsuoKodama", "HiroyukiHonda"], "doi": "10.1002/bit.21094"}
{"title": "Adriamycin-induced myocardial toxicity: new solutions for an old problem?", "abstract": "Adriamycin is a potent and broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent that plays a major role in cancer chemotherapy. Unfortunately, its use has been hampered by conventional toxicities and cardiotoxicity manifested by congestive cardiomyopathy. Adriamycin is particularly toxic to heart tissue and constitutes a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to its complex pathogenesis. In this review, the different forms of cardiotoxicity produced by adriamycin as well as the biochemical changes induced by this drug are summarized. Secondly, the current hypotheses proposed to explain adriamycin-induced myocardial damage (the iron and free-radical hypothesis, the metabolic hypothesis, the \"unifying hypothesis\" and apoptosis) and the attempts to reduce adriamycin-induced myocardial toxicity are discussed (e.g. dose limitation, close cardiac monitoring, alteration of dosage schedules, development of new anthracycline analogs, and the administration of protective agents and liposomal encapsulation). Finally, we summarized our own experimental and clinical experience in ameliorating and or preventing adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity and the latest attempts to prevent and/or monitor cardiac function. According to this, a combination of usual doses of calcium antagonist drugs plus vitamins A and E seems advisable.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2006-07-26", "authors": ["DeliaOutomuro", "Daniel RGrana", "FranciscoAzzato", "Jos\u00e9Milei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.05.005"}
{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of grape seed proanthocyanidins on isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in rats.", "abstract": "To investigate whether grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSP) might protect the heart against myocardial injury (MI) induced by isoproterenol (ISO), in a rat model.\nGSP was administered orally to Wistar albino rats (150-180 g) in three different doses, by gastric gavage (50, 100 and 150 mg kg(-1) GSP), 6 days a week for 5 weeks. At the end of this period, all the rats, except the normal untreated rats that served as the control group, were administered ISO, 85 mg kg(-1) subcutaneously, for 2 consecutive days to induce myocardial injury. After 48 h, rats (n=6 per group) were anaesthetized with anesthetic ether, sacrificed and the levels of biochemical and histological observations of the heart tissues were performed.\nOur results suggest that prior administration of GSP maintained the levels of the marker enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH and CK) in all the treatment groups (GSP-50-ISO, GSP-100-ISO and GSP-150-ISO) when compared to ISO-injected rats. The entire baseline groups also showed no significant alterations in serum marker enzyme levels in comparison to that of control group. Interestingly, in this study, there was no significant change in the basal levels of myocardial TBARS, GST, SOD and CAT on administration of GSP in all the three dosages (GSP-50-BL, GSP-100-BL and GSP-150-BL). However, a significant decrease occurred in the levels of GSH and GPx in group GSP-50-BL, which in the absence of any cellular injury (as evidenced by histological studies), is considered to be non-lethal. In the ISO-injected group there was a significant rise in TBARS and a significant decrease in GSH, GPx, GST, SOD and CAT when compared to group control. The administration of GSP maintained the activities of these enzymes close to normal levels when compared to group ISO, which proves the stress stabilizing action of GSP. The biochemical and histological evidence from this study shows that 100 and 150 mg kg(-1) of GSP protected against ISO-induced myocardial injury.\nThis study demonstrates that GSP has a significant effect in the protection of heart against MI induced by ISO. We believe that pretreatment with GSP may contribute to developing novel strategies in the prevention and treatment of cardiotoxic effects of elevated levels of catecholamine.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2006-07-11", "authors": ["KKarthikeyan", "B R SaralaBai", "S NiranjaliDevaraj"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2006.03.016"}
{"title": "Carvedilol improved diabetic rat cardiac function depending on antioxidant ability.", "abstract": "The risk for cardiovascular disease is significantly high in diabetes mellitus. Oxidative stress plays a dominant role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Bcl-2 gene has a close connection with antagonizing oxidative stress destroy in many diseases including diabetes. Carvedilol, an adrenoceptor blocker, also has antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties. To study the effect of carvedilol on the antioxidant status and expression of Bcl-2 in healthy and diabetic hearts, we investigated carvedilol-administrated healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. After small and large dosage (1 or 10mg/kg/d) carvedilol-administrated for 5 weeks, hemodynamic parameters, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in the cardiac tissues of all six groups were measured. Diabetic rats had higher left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), lower maximal rate of rise/fall left ventricle pressure development and decline (+/-dP/dtmax). These parameters were improved by administration of carvedilol. Diabetic rats showed elevated MDA level and CAT activity, but lower activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Carvedilol treatment increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and expression of Bcl-2 in healthy rats as well as diabetic rats. These results indicate that carvedilol improves cardiac function via its antioxidant property in diabetic rats partly.", "journal": "Diabetes research and clinical practice", "date": "2006-06-20", "authors": ["HeHuang", "JiangShan", "Xiao-HongPan", "Hui-PingWang", "Ling-BoQian", "QiangXia"], "doi": "10.1016/j.diabres.2006.04.016"}
{"title": "Mitochondrial toxicity in hearts of CD-1 mice following perinatal exposure to AZT, 3TC, or AZT/3TC in combination.", "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapies based on nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), like zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) and lamivudine ((-)2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine; 3TC), markedly reduce mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, AZT induces damage in nuclear DNA of mice exposed in utero and postnatally, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage has been observed in both human and mouse neonates following perinatal exposure to AZT and AZT/3TC in combination. To provide animal data modeling the NRTI-induced heart damage reported in human infants, we treated pregnant CD-1 mice throughout gestation and treated their pups by direct gavage from postnatal day (PND) 4 through PND 28 with daily doses of 150 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day AZT, 75 mg/kg bw/day 3TC, 125/62.5 mg/kg bw/day AZT/3TC, or the vehicle control. Half the pups were euthanized on PND 28; the remainder received no further dosing, and were euthanized at week 10. Heart tissue was collected, total DNA was extracted, and mtDNA copy number relative to nuclear DNA copy number, mtDNA damage, and mtDNA mutation assays were performed using PCR-based methods. Analyses revealed increases in mtDNA lesions in 4-week-old males and females treated with AZT or 3TC, but not in 10-week-old mice, suggesting that the damage resolved after treatment ceased. Interestingly, 10-week-old females treated with AZT/3TC had significant increases in mtDNA damage. Point mutations were elevated in 10-week-old females treated with AZT or AZT/3TC, but not 3TC; no increases in mutations were seen in either gender at 4 weeks of age. Our data suggest that AZT/3TC combination treatment produces greater mtDNA damage than either agent individually, and that female mice are more sensitive than males to AZT/3TC-induced mtDNA damage.", "journal": "Environmental and molecular mutagenesis", "date": "2006-01-06", "authors": ["Sherine S LChan", "Janine HSantos", "Joel NMeyer", "Bhaskar SMandavilli", "Dennis LCook", "Consuelo LMcCash", "Grace EKissling", "AbrahamNyska", "Julie FFoley", "Bennettvan Houten", "William CCopeland", "Vernon EWalker", "Kristine LWitt", "Jack BBishop"], "doi": "10.1002/em.20191"}
