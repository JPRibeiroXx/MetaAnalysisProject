{"title": "Fourier transform infrared study of the effect of diabetes on rat liver and heart tissues in the CH region.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia, a relative lack of insulin. The metabolic disturbances in diabetic patients are often associated with cardiac and liver dysfunctions. Generally, experimental diabetic models in animals have been used to study diabetes-related changes in organ function, but the complexity of intact tissues can cause contradictory results. For this reason, different techniques have been used to understand the mechanisms of these dysfunctions in diabetic organs. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on rat liver and heart tissues at the molecular level by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Wistar rats of both sexes, weighing 200-250 g, were made diabetic by a single injection of 50 mg kg(-1) intraperitoneal (i.p.) streptozotocin dissolved in 0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) and they were kept for 4-5 weeks. The diabetes status was checked by measuring the blood glucose level. In the complex FTIR spectra, the bands in the CH region for example the CH(2) antisymmetric and symmetric stretching, the CH(3) symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations due to lipids and proteins in the 3000-2800 cm(-1) region and CH(2) scissoring around 1464 cm(-1) and the CH(3) scissoring at 1454 cm(-1) were analyzed. Characteristic spectral bands of these diabetic samples were compared with those of control group to confirm the effect of diabetes on liver and heart tissues. The FTIR spectra revealed dramatic differences in the band positions and bandwidths, signal intensity values and signal intensity ratios between diabetic and control tissues. Similar differences were observed for diabetic liver and heart tissues. A significant increase in the bandwidth of the CH(2) symmetric and antisymmetric stretching and the CH(3) symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands has been observed for both tissue types. The wavenumber of the CH(3) asymmetric stretching band shifts to lower values, indicating an increase in the order in the deep interior part of the lipid chains. The ratio of the CH(2) symmetric to CH(3) symmetric stretching band (lipid/protein ratio) decreases by 13% for diabetic heart and liver tissues. A decrease is also detected in the ratio of the CH(2) scissoring to the CH(3) scissoring mode. The overall intensity of these bands is seen to increase for diabetic tissues.", "journal": "Talanta", "date": "2008-10-31", "authors": ["FSevercan", "NToyran", "NKaptan", "BTuran"], "doi": "10.1016/s0039-9140(00)00379-9"}

The results showed a remarkable increase of the diastolic level of calcium transients in the rat but no detectable change in the ground squirrel. Calcium transient of the ground squirrel, compared with that of the rat at the same temperature, had a shorter duration and showed a faster calcium removal. As indicated by the pharmacological effect of cyclopiazonic acid, calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was the major mechanism of calcium removal, and was faster in the ground squirrel than in the rat. Our results confirmed the essential role of SR in hypothermia-tolerant adaptation, and negated the importance of Na-Ca exchange.

Fluorescence bands that were due to mineral and organic tissue components were identified by measurement of LIF spectra of macroscopic fragments of calcified tissues that had been heat treated at 700 degrees C. The studies showed that LIF spectra of calcified tissues include fluorescence emission from tryptophan, collagen, elastin, and a mineral component of tissue, hydroxylapatite. The observed differences in LIF spectra of normal and calcified tissues with different pathologies may result not only from calcification-induced changes in relative collagen and elastin concentrations but also from additional (absent in normal heart tissue) fluorescence of hydroxylapatite. The calcification-induced changes in the LIF spectra of human heart-valve tissues, characterized by a 330/450 nm ratio, were found to be quite appreciable, which suggests that this ratio can be used with LIF measurements to evaluate the degree of heart-tissue calcification.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2008-03-20", "authors": ["P MLarionov", "A NMalov", "N AMaslov", "A MOrishich", "A TTitov", "V SShchukin"], "doi": "10.1364/ao.39.004031"}

To determine whether ultrasound can delineate changes in the physical properties of heart tissue undergoing cross linking, the authors employed a model in which increased cross linking was induced by treating rat myocardial tissue with specific chemical fixatives. Rat hearts (n=5 each group) were arrested at end-diastole, insonified (30 to 50 MHz) fresh within a few minutes of excision in a phosphate buffered solution, placed in a fixative (10% formalin or 2.5% glutaraldehyde) and insonified at 30-minute intervals thereafter for 24 hours. Ultrasonic attenuation increased in tissues cross linked with formalin (maximal change: 27.2+/-3.4 dB/cm) and glutaraldehyde (maximal change: 40.2+/-5.6 dB/cm) over a 24-hour period. The frequency dependence of the attenuation coefficient increased as a function of the extent of collagen cross links in formalin (maximal change: 0.8+/-0.3 dB/cm-MHz) and glutaraldehyde (maximal change: 0.9+/-0.6 dB/cm-MHz).

It has been ascertained that combined bodily exposure to dust and high ambient temperature promotes the development of prominent hypertrophy and hypoxia of the myocardium, activation of the lipid peroxidation processes, resulting in an appreciable degree of morphological changes in the cardiac tissue. It is suggested that the above changes might be a reflection of development of myocardial dystrophy originating in insufficiency of energy supply to the cardiomyocytes, that can lead to the development of cardiosclerosis of dystrophic genesis.

{"title": "The effect of insulin on the uptake and metabolic fate of glucose in isolated perfused hearts of dyslipemic rats.", "abstract": "Male Wistar rats chronically (15 weeks) fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD; 63% w/w) developed hypertriglyceridemia and impaired glucose homeostasis. Hearts from these animals were isolated and perfused using the Langendorff recirculating method. Glucose at levels similar to those found in the animal in vivo was used as the only exogenous substrate. The hearts were perfused for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of insulin (30 mU/mL) in the perfusion medium. In the absence of the hormone, glucose uptake was impaired and the glucose utilization was reduced, with a significant increase of lactate release. Glucose oxidation, which was estimated from the activation state of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), was depressed mainly due to both an increase of PDH kinase and a decrease of PDHa (active form of PDHc) activities. Although the addition of insulin in the perfusion medium improved the above parameters, it was unable to normalize them. The present results suggest that at least two different mechanisms might contribute to insulin resistance and to the impaired glucose metabolism in the perfused hearts of the dyslipemic SRD-fed animals: (1) reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and its utilization or (2) increased availability and oxidation of lipids (low PDHa and high PDH kinase activities), which in turn decrease glucose uptake and utilization.

{"title": "Biological plausibility for carbon monoxide as a copollutant in PM epidemiologic studies.", "abstract": "Several recent epidemiologic studies investigating the short-term effects of particulate matter (PM) concentrations have shown carbon monoxide (CO) to have the strongest and most consistent statistical relationship with hospital admissions for cardiac diseases. This article suggests a potential hypothesis for these epidemiologic observations. Oxygen (O2) is transported, in reversible combination with hemoglobin, from the lungs to the tissues, where it diffuses into cardiac myocytes. Within the myocyte a portion of the O2 diffuses directly to the mitochondria, while the remaining O2 is transported by facilitated diffusion bound to myoglobin, a heme protein found in muscle. Within the mitochondria, O2 reacts to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a high-energy phosphate compound that provides energy for all cell functions. Accordingly, the sustained production of ATP depends on the continuous delivery of O2 to the mitochondria, and failure at any point in the O2 transport system will compromise ATP production and myocardial function. Myoglobin, a fundamental constituent of cardiac muscle is essential for delivering O2 to the mitochondria. Myoglobin concentrations in cardiac tissue were 50% lower in patients with heart failure than in patients dying from noncardiac causes. Myoglobin concentrations are also severely depressed in animal models of congestive heart failure. Consequently, the role of myoglobin as a cellular transporter of O2 is seriously impaired by heart disease. Carbon monoxide reduces O2 transport to the tissues and, within the tissues, binds with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin (COMb). Thus, in cardiac patients CO further exacerbates the disease-related loss of myoglobin function. This further disrupts O2 transport and promotes adverse consequences for the compromised heart. Moreover, during hypoxia CO has the propensity of leaving the blood and binding with myoglobin in the intracellular compartment. Elderly persons with preexisting cardiopulmonary disorders appear to be at maximum risk of harmful health effects due to ambient air pollution exposure. Many of these disorders result in generalized or regional hypoxia. It is reasonable to hypothesize that CO also moves out of the blood of these patients and into the heart tissue whenever they are under hypoxic stress, such as exercise. Accordingly, CO binds with the marginal myoglobin concentrations present in the hearts of cardiac patients and further compromises cardiac function, resulting in poor tolerance of activity. Therefore, reduced cardiac myoglobin in people with heart disease, further exacerbated by CO moving into the cardiac tissue during episodes of hypoxia, may account for the positive association between ambient CO concentrations and hospitalization for heart disease.", "journal": "Inhalation toxicology", "date": "2003-07-29", "authors": ["J JMcGrath"], "doi": "10.1080/089583700750019521"}

{"title": "The effect of angiotensin II on mitogen-activated protein kinase in human cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "The role of angiotensin II (Ang II)-receptors on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in cardiomyocytes remains controversial. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the actions of AT(1)- and AT(2)-receptors on Ang II-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK activities in human cardiomyocytes. Human cardiac tissue was obtained from open-heart surgery (n=6). The cardiac tissue was minced and incubated in the special tissue culture system for 24 hours in the absence or presence of Ang II (10(-7) M). These studies were repeated with the AT(1)-receptor antagonist losartan (10(-6) M) or the AT(2)-receptor antagonist PD-123319 (10(-6) M). Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis with phospho-antibodies were performed to determine ERK, JNK and p38 activities. Ang II increased ERK and p38 activities in human cardiomyocytes. The effects of Ang II were abolished by losartan and enhanced by PD-123319. Co-incubation with both losartan and PD-123319 resulted in a decrease of ERK and p38 activities in cardiomyocytes. The immunohistochemical staining of JNK showed no significant differences between Ang II alone, Ang II plus losartan and Ang II plus PD-123319 groups. In conclusion, Ang II has a potent effect on ERK and p38 MAPK activities in cardiomyocytes, by acting through AT(1)-receptors. This effect of Ang II is modified by AT(2)-receptors. Therefore, Ang II, via AT(1)- and AT(2)-receptor stimulation, has a distinct effect on MAPK activity in cardiomyocytes.", "journal": "Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS", "date": "2002-04-23", "authors": ["CWei", "M GCardarelli", "S WDowning", "J SMcLaughlin"], "doi": "10.3317/jraas.2000.070"}

An increase of Tg and glycogen (Gly) in heart muscle was also observed. HyperTg with altered glucose metabolism could have profound effects on myocardial glucose utilization. To test this hypothesis male Wistar rats were fed a semi-synthetic SRD (w/w: 62.5% sucrose, 8% corn-oil, 17% protein), and the control group (CD) received the same semi-synthetic diet, except that sucrose was replaced with starch for 90 days. At that time, the hearts from these animals were isolated and perfused for 30 min in the presence or absence of insulin (30 mU/ml). Levels of the exogenous substrates were similar to those found in the plasma of the animal in vivo in both dietary groups (glucose 8.5 mM, palmitate 0.8 mM in SRD and glucose 5-5 mM, palmitate 0.3 mM in CD). In the absence of insulin glucose uptake was reduced (40%) and lactate release was increased (50%) in SRD hearts.

Murine models of CB3 myocarditis closely mimic the pathogenesis in humans. There are also indications that metals, such as mercury, and trace elements may interact and adversely affect viral replication and development of inflammatory lesions. The effects of low-dose MeHg exposure on myocardial trace element distribution, as determined by means of nuclear microscopy, was studied in CB3 myocarditis. Balb/c mice were fed a MeHg-containing diet (3.9 mg/kg diet) for 12 wk prior to infection. Areas of inflammatory lesions in the myocardium were identified by traditional histologic examination, and serial tissue sections in these selected areas were used for immune histology (macrophages), in situ hybridization of virus genomes, and nuclear microscopy of tissue trace element distribution. Areas with no inflammation or virus were compared with areas of ongoing inflammation and viral replication. In the inflammatory lesions of MeHg-exposed mice as compared to nonexposed mice, the myocardial contents of calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) were significantly increased, whereas the zinc (Zn) content was decreased. The increased Ca and decreased Zn contents in the inflamed heart may partly explain a more severe disease in MeHg-exposed individuals. Although not significant in the present study, with a limited number of mice, the inflammatory and necrotic lesions in the ventricular myocardium on d 7 of the infection was increased by 50% (from 2.2% to 3.3% of the tissue section area) in MeHg-exposed mice and, also, there was a tendency of increased persistence of virus with MeHg exposure. No increased MeHg uptake, either in the inflammatory lesions or in the areas of noninflamed heart tissue in infected mice, could be detected.

The most relevant cardiac ultrastructural findings in this model showed diffuse disarray of the myofibrils and abnormal pattern of the bands in the sarcomera, contractile element disorganisation, degeneration of fibres and loss of the characteristic sarcomeric structure given the appearance of a lax tissue. One of the most prominent features was the presence of a remarkable perinuclear oedema and the perinuclear cistern exhibited indentations over its whole arrangement. The vascular endothelium of the microvessels exhibited alterations with evident cytoplasmic projections toward the lumen of the vessel. Mitochondria presented a condensed conformation. All findings were degenerative signs of the contractile apparatus. We suggest that any cardiac tissue damage produced by toxins present in this venom are responsible for some of the clinical manifestations in envenomed animals and patients.", "journal": "Journal of submicroscopic cytology and pathology", "date": "2001-04-12", "authors": ["MStrauss", "ARodriguez-Acosta", "MPulido-Mendez"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Isoproterenol inhibits bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from human heart tissue.", "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), may play a role in heart disease. Elevated plasma levels of the cytokine have been reported in congestive heart failure and severe angina and after myocardial infarction. The exact role of TNF-alpha in heart disease and how production is stimulated and regulated in the heart are current areas of investigation. Regarding regulation of production, isoproterenol elevates cyclic AMP and inhibits TNF-alpha release in macrophages. Therefore we hypothesized that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system would inhibit release of the cytokine from heart tissue. With Institutional Review Board approval and patient consent atrial tissue was obtained during preparation for cardiac bypass. The tissue was divided into segments, placed in culture medium, and incubated for various times in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (20 microg/mL) and/or isoproterenol (1 microM). The medium was removed and analyzed for biologically active TNF-alpha by the L929 cell cytotoxicity assay. Tissue samples were weighed and TNF-alpha release was expressed as pg TNF-alpha/mg tissue. Initially, to determine the time course of release, measurements were made at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 360 minutes after the addition of LPS. Elevated TNF-alpha levels in the culture medium were reliably detected at 360 minutes after exposure to LPS. In atrial tissue obtained from seven patients TNF-alpha released into the culture medium at 360 minutes was 6 +/- 3 pg/mg tissue. In the presence of LPS, levels of the cytokine in the culture medium increased to 604 +/- 233 pg/mg tissue (P < 0.05 vs LPS alone). When isoproterenol and LPS were simultaneously added to the culture medium release of TNF-alpha was reduced by 87 per cent to 82 +/- 40 pg/mg tissue (P < 0.05 vs LPS alone). Our results show that activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibits myocardial production of TNF-alpha. This finding suggests that the sympathetic nervous system inhibits production of the cytokine and that impaired sympathetic function in heart failure may play a role in the elevated levels of TNF-alpha.", "journal": "The American surgeon", "date": "2001-03-23", "authors": ["K RSmart", "D JWarejcka", "M RCastresana", "M LDalton", "J GWebb", "W HNewman"], "doi": null}

It is in phase II/III trials [221118]. Cariporide inhibits the interchange of sodium ions and protons in myocardial cells during unstable angina or MI when cells metabolize anerobically. This prevents lactic acid production and an increase in calcium levels which causes cardiac arrhythmias and heart tissue death [253616]. Approval filings in the US and EU had been scheduled for the second half of 1999 [309323]. In 1998, HMR expected that the drug would be launched in 2000, and would have a potential market in excess of DM 750 million [288651]. By May 2000, however, the launch date had been revised for between 2003 and 2004 [370971], [379336]. Aventis is expecting peak sales to be around $400 million [333420]. In March 1999, HMR reported that trials for MI had been suspended after results from the phase III GUARDIAN trial did not achieve statistical significance [353173]. In August 2000, however, a phase II trial in patients with acute MI was underway [379051]. A phase III trial in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was expected to begin in early 2000 after the results of ongoing dose-optimization studies in CABG patients are known. As of May 2000, however, this trial had not begun, although based on promising CABG-related results of the GUARDIAN trial, the phase III trial in this indication is expected to begin in the first half of 2001 [370971]. There were also plans for the initiation of European phase II trials in acute MI patients; similar phase II trials are ongoing in Japan. In September 2000, Merrill Lynch predicated launch in 2003 [383742]. In February 1999, Lehman Brothers predicted a 70% probability that cariporide would reach market in the US/Europe and 50% probability that it would reach the Japanese market. They also predicted a US/European launch in 2000 with peak sales of $400 million in 2008 and a Japanese launch in 2002 with peak sales of $100 million [319225].", "journal": "Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)", "date": "2001-03-16", "authors": ["BChin", "G YLip"], "doi": null}

Although the exact mechanism of iron-induced heart failure remains to be elucidated, the toxicity of iron in biological systems is believed to be attributed to its ability to catalyze the generation of oxygen-free radicals. In the current investigation, the dose-dependent effects of chronic iron-loading on heart tissue concentrations of iron, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, free-radical production, and cardiac dysfunction were investigated in a murine model of iron-overload cardiomyopathy. It was shown that chronic iron-overload results in dose-dependent (a) increases in myocardial iron burden, (b) decreases in the protective antioxidant enzyme GPx activity, (c) increased free-radical production, and (d) increased mortality.

{"title": "Vitamin E deficiency fails to affect myocardial performance during in vivo ischemia-reperfusion.", "abstract": "Vitamin E content of cardiac tissue has been proposed to play a major role in the damage caused by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). Previous studies using in vitro models have examined vitamin E deficiency and I-R-induced myocardial damage with equivocal results. The purpose of this study was to use an in vivo model of myocardial I-R to determine the effects of vitamin E deficiency on myocardial I-R-induced damage. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (4-mo old) were assigned to either: 1) control diet (CON), or 2) vitamin E deficient diet (VE-DEF). The CON diet was prepared to meet AIN-93M standards, which contains 75 IU vitamin E/kg diet. The VE-DEF diet was the AIN-93M diet prepared with tocopherol stripped corn oil and no vitamin E. Following a 14-week feeding period, significant differences (p < 0.05) existed in mean myocardial VE levels between groups (mean values +/- SEM: CON = 48.2 +/- 3.5; VE-DEF = 12.4 +/- 1.4 micrograms VE/g wet weight). Animals from both experimental groups were subjected to an in vivo I-R protocol consisting of 25 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. No group differences (p > 0.05) existed in cardiac performance (peak arterial pressure or ventricular work) or the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during the I-R protocol. VE-DEF animals had significantly higher (p < 0.05) levels of myocardial lipid peroxidation and lower (p < 0.05) protein thiols following I-R compared to the CON animals. These data suggest that although vitamin E deficiency increases oxidative damage resulting from myocardial I-R, it does not affect cardiac performance during the insult.", "journal": "International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Sixteen samples from fixed porcine cardiac tissue and, for comparison, 8 samples from leaflets of Toronto-SPV and Freestyle valves were implanted subcutaneously in 10 Wistar rats for 12 weeks and their calcium content was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.\nSLA-I epitopes were no longer detectable using anti-SLA-I antibodies after fixation for 3 h. The SLA-II antigens remained detectable after longer fixation period. Short-time fixation resulted in marked calcification of the porcine cardiac tissue and to destruction of the SLA-I epitopes, whereas, even after longer fixation time, the epitopes of the SLA-II antigen remain unaffected.\nChelate formation due to glutaraldehyde treatment provides protection against calcification. Short-time fixed porcine cardiac tissue has a tendency towards a greater degree of calcification than longer fixation periods.

We hypothesize that virtual anodes can cause a region of delayed activation, separating two regions of early activation caused by the virtual cathode. Using a high-density electrode array in 42 superfused epicardial slices from 14 canine left ventricles, we observed regions of early and delayed activation and different pathways of retrograde propagation corresponding to the earlier patterns. Retrograde propagation was seen from the transversely located early activation area through areas of delayed activation toward the cathode, and from the early activation area toward the cathode directly. These pathways caused a wide dispersion in the direction of retrograde propagation (2 degrees +/- 31 degrees, n = 179, relative to the fast axis of threshold activation; radial velocity: 0.5 +/- 0.2 m/s, n = 95, in 12 slices from 8 hearts with stimuli of 330 micros, 0.8-30 mA). Delayed activations were observed 0 degrees +/- 6 degrees (n = 32) from the axis in 23 maps (at differing stimulation strengths) recorded in 13 slices from 10 hearts.

Autoradiograms obtained from solvent-extracted tape-sections revealed an even distribution of DMBA- and B[a]P-derived radioactivity in control mice lacking sites of selective binding in the tissues. In mice pretreated with a cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) inducer, beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) or 3,3',4,4', 5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), a noticeable accumulation of bound radioactivity was observed in the pulmonary alveolar region. Increased labelling was also observed in heart tissue of induced mice. As demonstrated by microautoradiography of tissues from CYP1A-induced mice treated with 3H-DMBA or 3H-B[a]P in vivo, irreversible binding in lung tissue was present in endothelial cells of arteries and veins, in the alveolar septal walls, and in type 2 pneumocytes. In heart tissue, binding was confined to endothelial cells of arteries, capillaries and veins. In liver, binding was found in the hepatocytes as well as in endothelial cells of the portal veins, whereas no binding was seen in endothelial cells of the sinusoids, central veins, or arteries. These findings were confirmed in vitro using 3H-DMBA-exposed precision-cut slices, indicating that reactive intermediates of DMBA and B(a)P were formed in situ. The addition of the CYP1A inhibitor ellipticine abolished binding in the target endothelial cells. Increased endothelial binding in the lungs and liver of CYP1A-induced mice was concomitant with increased 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and DMBA hydroxylase activity. In heart, endothelial binding was positively correlated with EROD, but not with DMBA hydroxylase.

We investigated the expression of the various isoforms of VEGF in normal and ischemic dog heart tissues using Reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction, Ribonuclease Protection Assay and Western blotting. The nucleotide sequences of the major isoforms of VEGF were also determined using homology cloning techniques. Our study showed that the nucleotide sequences of dog VEGF were highly homologous to human VEGF especially in the c-terminal region spanning exons 58.

The TNF and IL-6 expression levels in the myocardium were investigated from biopsy specimens. The study of the immunological background of the cardiomyopathies was supplemented with screening of anti-heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) antibodies in the sera of the patients.\nElevated levels of circulating TNF (25-150 U/ml) and IL-6 (50-500 pg/ml) were found in 85% of the patients in the DCM and IHD groups, whereas only the IL-6 level was elevated (125-500 pg/ml) in the HCM patients. The in vitro TNF-alpha production was higher than in the normal controls only in the DCM group. The ventricular tissue of the DCM patients expressed TNF-alpha and IL-6. In vitro experiments were performed to examine the production of TNF and IL-6 by cultured rat cardiac myocytes (H9C2) under hypoxic conditions.

The mechanism of the development of primary DCM is still unknown; the high in vitro production of proinflammatory cytokines in the leucocytes of patients with DCM, the presence of TNF and IL-6 in their cardiac tissue and the high prevalence of anti-Hsp60 antibodies in their sera suggest a strong immunological background in the pathophysiology of the disease.", "journal": "Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology", "date": "2001-02-15", "authors": ["YM\u00e1ndi", "MHogye", "E MTalha", "ESkol\u00e1k", "MCsan\u00e1dy"], "doi": "10.1159/000055916"}

To identify and characterize the structural components of mitochondrial RNA processing and translation, the Mammalian Mitochondrial Ribosomal Consortium has been formed. The 338 amino acid (aa) residues long MRP-L5 was identified (O'Brien et al., 1999. J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36043-36051), and its transcript was screened for tissue specific splice-variants. Screening of the EST databases revealed a single putative splice-variant, due to the insertion of an exon consisting of 89 nucleotides prior to the last exon. Screening of multiple cDNA libraries revealed this inserted exon to be present only in heart tissue, in addition to the predominant MRP-L5 transcript. Sequencing of this region confirmed the EST sequence, and showed in the splice-variant a termination triplet at the beginning of the last exon. Thus the inserted exon replaces the coding sequence of the regular last exon, and creates a new 353 aa long protein (MRP-L5V1).

Sequence analysis of MRP-L5V1 also suggests a likely transmembrane domain at the C-terminus.

In study 1, rats received biweekly i.p. injections of 0 (saline=S), 3, 6, or 12 mg FeCl3/ml for 3-wks prior to imposing 30 min. I/15 min. R in vitro. The highest dose caused no elevations in plasma or heart tissue Fe levels, but did further reduce post-ischemic recoveries of left ventricular developed pressure (17% lower), cardiac work (57%) and output (54%), and increased effluent lipid hydroperoxides (2.1-fold) compared to the S-group.

In study 2, isolated hearts from untreated rats were exposed to two-IP cycles: during IP, total effluent iron content (atomic absorption) increased 11.4-fold compared to control and analysis of cardiovascular tissue iron distribution (X-ray microanalysis) suggested that iron loss from capillary endothelium was far greater than from tissue myocytes. Moreover, iron-catalyzed production of alkoxyl radicals following severe I/R stress (40 min. I/15 min. R) was substantially lower (73%) in IP hearts compared to the non-IP counterparts.

The aim of this study was to associate the altered left ventricular mechanics with molecular pathways in mice who lacked these associated vascular pathologies. This study compared the left ventricular function of two groups of mice (N = 20 each), 6 months old and 16 months old (senescent). The mice were anesthetized with urethane and alpha-chloralose, and a Millar 1.4 Fr. conductance micromanometer catheter was placed into the left ventricle for acquisition of pressure-volume loops.

The cardiac index, preload recruitable stroke work, and the slope (Ees) of the end-systolic pressure volume relationship were significantly less in the senescent group compared to the young mice.

{"title": "Model study of vector-loop morphology during electrical mapping of microscopic conduction in cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "The large variety in loop morphology of potential differences recorded at the cardiac surface has been generally attributed to structural discontinuities of the tissue. The aim of this work was to examine if the diversity of vector loops of the electric field E found experimentally may also arise during continuous anisotrope conduction. For this purpose a monodomain computer model was used, consisting of a two-dimensional sheet of excitable tissue surrounded with an unbounded volume conductor. Close to the tissue surface our computations predicted a narrow biphasic course of phi(e) with peak-to-peak separation of less than 400 microm. We examined how accurately E could be reconstructed from measurements recorded with four-element electrode arrays and how activation sequence, interelectrode spacing, and probe orientation affects the results. We found \"closed\" vector loops of E in planar, and at the apex of elliptical wave fronts, whereas outside of these regions vector loops were \"open.\" Varying probe orientation and size resulted in substantial changes of vector-loop morphology. We concluded that close to the cardiac current sources accurate measurement of E would require interelectrode distances of less than 100 microm.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2001-01-06", "authors": ["GPlank", "EHofer"], "doi": "10.1114/1.1320841"}

Within the anisotropic myocardium a bidomain model based FEM formulation is applied. In the surrounding isotropic volume conductor the BEM is adopted. Coupling is enabled by requesting continuity of the electric potential and the normal of the current density across the boundary of the heart. Here, the BEM part is coupled as an equivalent finite element to the finite element stiffness matrix, thus preserving in part its sparse property. First, continuous convergence of the coupling scheme is shown for a spherical model comparing the computed results to an analytic reference solution. Then, the method is extended to the depolarization phase in a fibrous model of a dog ventricle. A precomputed activation sequence obtained using a fine mesh of the heart was downsampled and used to calculate body surface potentials and extracorporal magnetic fields considering the anisotropic bidomain conductivities. Results are compared to those obtained by neglecting in part or totally (oblique or uniform dipole layer model) anisotropic properties.

However, estimated IC(50) values range over two to three orders of concentration, and it is unclear whether this reflects a high selectivity by one or both of the phenylalkylamines for particular K(+) channels. The purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration-dependent actions of verapamil and D600 on three defined cardiac K(+) currents. Guinea-pig ventricular myocytes in the conventional whole-cell configuration were bathed with normal Tyrode's or K(+)-free solution, and pulsed from -80 mV for measurement of the effects of 0.01 microM to 3 mM verapamil and D600 on the inwardly-rectifying K(+) current (I:(Kl)) and the two delayed-rectifier K(+) currents, rapidly-activating I:(Kr) and slowly-activating I:(Ks). The phenylalkylamines inhibited both inward- and outward-directed I:(Kl). The IC(50) values for outward I:(Kl) were approximately 220 microM. Verapamil and D600 were approximately equipotent inhibitors of the delayed-rectifier K(+) currents. They inhibited I:(Kr) with IC(50) near 3 microM, and I:(Ks) with IC(50) > or =280 microM.

These include 1) the selection and/or optimization of the vector for gene transfer; 2) the identification of the target gene(s); 3) the use of cardiac-specific promoters; and 4) the use of an appropriate delivery system for administration. Currently, several vectors (e.g., viral and nonviral vectors) have been developed and many target genes have been identified (e.g., VEGF, FGF, beta-AR, etc.). Many investigations have provided experimental models for gene delivery systems but the most efficient cardiac gene transfer was obtained from intramyocardial injection or perfusion of explanted myocardium.

Our work, however, failed to implicate either early complete clearance of challenge muscle larvae (ML), or rapid elimination of newborn larvae (NBL) in the phenomenon noted in reinfected rats. This study clarifies that issue using 2 established facts in T. spiralis biology and anti-T. spiralis immunology. That is, adult worms injure gut cells and immune destruction of NBL requires release of material also toxic to host cells. To approach the above problem we analysed relevant and irrelevant rat organs for increased heat shock protein (HSP) production at 1, 7, 14, 20 and 27 p.i. during first and second infections. Organs examined were intestines, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), heart and lungs. Using densitometric analyses of immunoblots, increased HSP expression was detected on day 7 in intestines from both primary and secondary-infected rats albeit that the change in the latter was just short of significant. Interestingly, MLN only exhibited increased HSP levels in the reinfected rat model with increased HSP levels persisting for 1 week. A lasting shock response was detected in reinfected rats; in contrast, first exposure resulted in shock responses being evident in lungs at either day 7 or day 14, only. These findings suggest that (i) in immune rats, a few challenge ML develop into adults, produce NBL which are trapped within MLN, and (ii) that anti-T. spiralis and/or anti-NBL immunity is associated with an, as yet, uncomprehended stress to host's heart tissues.", "journal": "Parasitology", "date": "2000-12-29", "authors": ["JP\u00e9rez-Serrano", "JMart\u00ednez", "PRegal", "W EBernadina", "FRodr\u00edguez-Caabeiro"], "doi": "10.1017/s003118209900671x"}

Southern blots showed that genomic DNA of juvenile lampreys possesses several regions that are similar to segments of the AE gene from other vertebrates. However, physiological experiments examining rapid anion fluxes across the red blood cell (rbc) membrane and molecular experiments examining mRNA transcript levels both indicated that the anion exchange protein is absent in sea lamprey rbcs. In contrast, lamprey kidney, skeletal muscle, liver and heart tissue all appeared to possess mRNA transcripts for an AE protein. Further evidence for the presence of an AE protein in kidney tissue was obtained from Western blots. In order to evaluate the impact of the apparent rbc anion exchange limitations, the bicarbonate permeability of lamprey rbcs was also evaluated using mass spectrometry. The bicarbonate permeability of the lamprey rbc membrane was an order of magnitude lower than that of trout rbcs. Taken together, these results indicate that the gene for the AE protein is indeed present in lampreys, but it is not expressed in the rbc. Moreover, the process of CO2 transport in lamprey probably does not involve bicarbonate transport across the rbc membrane.", "journal": "Journal of comparative physiology.

To test whether Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) induced pronounced cardiomyopathy during severe immune dysfunction of murine AIDS, female C57BL/6 mice were infected with LP-BM5 retrovirus and superinfected with CVB3. Some were also injected daily with cocaine hydrochloride in 0.9% saline solution (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, because cocaine also suppresses cellular immune response. Heart tissue was analyzed histopathologically. Mice experiencing concurrent retrovirus and Coxsackievirus infection had a high degree of cardiac lesions consistent with myopathy compared with findings in uninfected animals (p <.05). Cocaine injection during murine retrovirus infection greatly exacerbated the pathogenesis of Coxsackievirus infection. C57BL/6 mice, essentially resistant to Coxsackievirus-induced cardiomyopathy, became susceptible during the immune dysfunction in murine AIDS. This suggests that retrovirus infection causes conditions favoring Coxsackie-induced cardiac lesions. Interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 expression by splenocytes from the dually infected retrovirus and Coxsackievirus group showed no significant differences when the animals were also cocaine treated.

In this article, we briefly review recent experimental evidence on the critical role of a prominent signaling pathway, the Jak/STAT pathway in activation and maintenance of the local RAS in cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia. Recent studies in our laboratory document that the promoter of the prohormone angiotensinogen (Ang) gene serves as the target site for STAT proteins, thereby linking the Jak/STAT pathway to activation of heart tissue autocrine Ang II loop. STAT5A and STAT6, are selectively activated when the heart is subjected to ischemic injury, whereas activation of STAT3 and STAT5A is involved in myocardial hypertrophy. Blockage of RAS activation by treatment with specific inhibitor promotes a remarkable recovery in functional hemodynamics of the myocardium.

Heart from autoimmune myocarditis mice show mRNA iNOS-related dysfunction with a decrease in heart contractility. This effect was accompanied with an increase production of cyclic GMP and was improved by treating autoimmune mice with an inhibitor of iNOS activity. In addition, autoimmune myocardium expressed an active histamine H(1) receptor mRNA coupled to phospholipase C. The activation of H(1) receptor by ThEA stimulated both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and heart contractility. Normal myocardium did not expressed neither iNOS mRNA nor H(1) receptor mRNA. In conclusions: the development of autoimmune cardiac dysfunction was associated with the expression of iNOS mRNA, cyclic GMP accumulation and the expression of an active histamine H(1) receptor mRNA with increase production of inositol phosphates.

An inflammatory-cell infiltration was not observed in the AAV-VEGF- and AAV-LacZ-inoculated hearts, and angioma-like structure was not observed.

When the tissue temperature exceeds 100 degrees C in all points that are directly in front of the catheter, these points are considered to be instantly vaporised, and the catheter advances over these points. The computed temperature time course coincides with measured temperature at small voltages (< 16 V). Simulated perforation occurs when the voltage exceeds a threshold of 70-80 V for a catheter diameter of 0.30-0.44 mm, which coincides with experimental observations in the myocardium. A voltage exceeding this perforation threshold tends to decrease tissue damage. Shorter electrodes (0.7 mm as against 2.4 mm) with smaller diameters produce a more rapid perforation.

We identified this protein as the mouse cardiac myosin heavy chain by sequencing analysis. The study of IgG isotype profile revealed the occurrence of all IgG isotypes against cruzipain and myosin. IgG1 showed the strongest reactivity against cruzipain, whereas IgG2a was the main isotype against myosin.

{"title": "Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Anthracycline antibiotics are among the most effective and widely used antineoplastic drugs. Their usefulness is limited by a cumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity, whose precise mechanisms are not clear as yet. The principal role is possibly exerted by free oxygen radicals generated by \"redox-cycling\" of anthracycline molecule and/or by the formation of anthracycline-ferric ion complexes. The iron catalyzes the hydroxyl radical production via Haber-Weiss reaction. The selective toxicity of ANT against cardiomyocytes results from high accumulation of ANT in cardiac tissue, appreciable production of oxygen radicals by mitochondria and relatively poor antioxidant defense systems. Other additional mechanisms of the anthracycline cardiotoxicity have been proposed--calcium overload, histamine release and impairment in autonomic regulation of heart function. The currently used methods for an early identification of anthracycline cardiotoxicity comprise ECG measurement, biochemical markers, functional measurement and morphologic examination. Among a plenty of studied cardioprotective agents only dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) has been approved for clinical use. Its protective effect likely consists in intracellular chelating of iron. However, in high doses dexrazoxane itself may cause myelotoxicity. This fact encourages investigation of new cardioprotectants with lower toxicity.

{"title": "Bioengineered cardiac grafts: A new approach to repair the infarcted myocardium?", "abstract": "The myocardium is unable to regenerate because cardiomyocytes cannot replicate after injury. The heart is therefore an attractive target for tissue engineering to replace infarcted myocardium and enhance cardiac function. We tested the feasibility of bioengineering cardiac tissue within novel 3-dimensional (3D) scaffolds.\nWe isolated and grew fetal cardiac cells within 3D porous alginate scaffolds. The cell constructs were cultured for 4 days to evaluate viability and morphology before implantation. Light microscopy revealed that within 2 to 3 days in culture, the dissociated cardiac cells form distinctive, multicellular contracting aggregates within the scaffold pores. Seven days after myocardial infarction, rats were randomized to biograft implantation (n=6) or sham-operation (n=6) into the myocardial scar. Echocardiography study was performed before and 65+/-5 days after implantation to assess left ventricular (LV) remodeling and function. Hearts were harvested 9 weeks after implantation. Visual examination of the biograft revealed intensive neovascularization from the neighboring coronary network. Histological examination revealed the presence of myofibers embedded in collagen fibers and a large number of blood vessels. The specimens showed almost complete disappearance of the scaffold and good integration into the host. Although control animals developed significant LV dilatation accompanied by progressive deterioration in LV contractility, in the biograft-treated rats, attenuation of LV dilatation and no change in LV contractility were observed.\nAlginate scaffolds provide a conducive environment to facilitate the 3D culturing of cardiac cells. After implantation into the infarcted myocardium, the biografts stimulated intense neovascularization and attenuated LV dilatation and failure in experimental rats compared with controls. This strategy can be used for regeneration and healing of the infarcted myocardium.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2000-11-18", "authors": ["JLeor", "SAboulafia-Etzion", "ADar", "LShapiro", "I MBarbash", "ABattler", "YGranot", "SCohen"], "doi": "10.1161/01.cir.102.suppl_3.iii-56"}

In in vitro experiments, recombinant human corin has recently been shown to activate pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a cardiac hormone essential for the regulation of blood pressure. Here we report the first characterization of corin protein expression in heart tissue. We generated antibodies to two different peptides derived from unique regions of the corin polypeptide, which detected immunoreactive corin protein of approximately 125-135 kDa in lysates from human heart tissues. Immunostaining of sections of human heart showed corin expression was specifically localized to the cross striations of cardiac myocytes, with a pattern of expression consistent with an integral membrane localization. Corin was not detected in sections of skeletal or smooth muscle. Corin has been suggested to be a candidate gene for the rare congenital heart disease, total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) as the corin gene colocalizes to the TAPVR locus on human chromosome 4. However examination of corin protein expression in TAPVR heart tissue did not show evidence of abnormal corin expression. The demonstrated corin protein expression by heart myocytes supports its proposed role as the pro-ANP convertase, and thus a potentially critical mediator of major cardiovascular diseases including hypertension and congestive heart failure.", "journal": "European journal of biochemistry", "date": "2000-11-18", "authors": ["J DHooper", "A LScarman", "B EClarke", "J FNormyle", "T MAntalis"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1432-1033.2000.01806.x"}

Recently, some NMDA receptor subunits have also been described in adult extraneuronal tissues and keratinocytes. However, their developmental expression patterns are currently unknown. With use of RT-PCR and western blot analysis, the expression of NMDA receptor subunit NR2B was investigated in the developing rat heart. NR2B mRNA and protein were detected in heart tissue of rats from embryonic day 14 until postnatal day 21 but disappeared 10 weeks after birth.

Effects of anoxic exposure on in vivo cardiac performance.", "abstract": "The extreme anoxia-tolerance of freshwater turtles under cold conditions is well documented, but little is known about their cardiac performance in such situations. Using chronic catheterization techniques, we measured systemic cardiac power output (PO(sys)), systemic cardiac output (Q(.)(sys)), heart rate (fh), systemic stroke volume (V(s,sys)), systemic resistance (R(sys)) and mean arterial pressure (P(sys)) in red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta). The effects of cold acclimation and anoxic exposure were studied. Turtles were acclimated to either 22 degrees C or 5 degrees C, and the anoxic exposure was either acute (6 h) at 22 degrees C or chronic (3 weeks) at 5 degrees C. Cold acclimation alone decreased PO(sys) by 15-fold, representing a Q(10) of 8.8. In addition, fh and V(s,sys) decreased significantly, while R(sys) increased and moderated the arterial hypotension. Acute and chronic anoxic exposures significantly decreased PO(sys), V(s,sys), fh and P(sys) and increased R(sys). But the changes were qualitatively much larger with chronic anoxia. For example, acute anoxia in 22 degrees C-acclimated turtles decreased PO(sys) by 6.6-fold, whereas chronic anoxia in 5 degrees C-acclimated turtles decreased PO(sys) by 20-fold. The remarkable cardiovascular down-regulation that accompanies long periods of cold anoxia in these turtles was characterized by comparing cardiovascular status during chronic anoxia at 5 degrees C with that during normoxia at 22 degrees C. Cardiac PO(sys) was reduced 330-fold, through decreases in Q(.)(sys) (120-fold), fh (24.2-fold), V(s,sys) (5.7-fold) and P(sys) (2. 2-fold), while R(sys) was increased 64.6-fold. We also compared cardiac glycolytic rates by assuming that PO(sys) was proportional to ATP supply and that glycolysis yielded 18 times less ATP per mole of glucose than oxidative metabolism. At 22 degrees C, the 6.6-fold decrease in PO(sys) with anoxia suggests that a Pasteur effect was needed in cardiac tissues during acute anoxia. However, this would not be so with chronic anoxia at 5 degrees C because of the 22-fold decrease in PO(sys). We propose that the suppression of the Pasteur effect and the large Q(10) values for cold acclimation would conserve glucose stores and enable turtles to withstand anoxia much longer under cold than under warm conditions.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2000-11-15", "authors": ["J MHicks", "A PFarrell"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.203.24.3765"}

This study uses laser energy delivered through diffusing optical fibers as an alternative to radiofrequency energy for the creation of linear lesions in cardiac tissue in a single application.\nSamples of canine myocardium were placed in a heated, circulating saline bath and irradiated with a 1.06-microm, continuous-wave Nd:YAG laser during in vitro studies. Laser ablation was then performed in vivo on the epicardial surface of the right ventricle during an open-chest procedure by using similar ablation parameters. Laser energy was delivered to the tissue by being diffused radially through flexible optical fiber tips oriented parallel to the tissue surface. Histology and temperature measurements verified transmurality, continuity, and linearity of the lesions.\nPeak tissue temperatures measured in vitro remained low (51 +/- 1 degrees C at the endocardial surface, 61 +/- 6 degrees C in the mid-myocardium, and 55 +/- 6 degrees C at the epicardial surface) with no evidence of tissue charring or vaporization. Lesion dimensions produced in vitro and in vivo were similar (depth, 6 mm; width, 8-10 mm; length, 16-22 mm), demonstrating that tissue perfusion in vivo did not significantly alter the heating.\nLong linear lesions, necessary for duplication of the surgical maze procedure during catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, may be created by using laser radiation delivered through flexible diffusing optical fiber tips.

The desmosome consists of several proteins, of which desmoplakin is the most abundant. Here, we describe the first recessive human mutation, 7901delG, in the desmoplakin gene which causes a generalized striate keratoderma particularly affecting the palmoplantar epidermis, woolly hair and a dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy. A number of the patients with this syndromic disorder suffer heart failure in their teenage years, resulting in early morbidity. All tested affected members of three families from Ecuador were homozygous for this mutation which produces a premature stop codon leading to a truncated desmoplakin protein missing the C domain of the tail region. Histology of the skin revealed large intercellular spaces and clustering of desmosomes at the infrequent sites of keratinocyte adhesion. Immunohistochemistry of skin from the patients showed a perinuclear localization of keratin in suprabasal keratinocytes, suggesting a collapsed intermediate filament network. This study demonstrates the importance of desmoplakin in the attachment of intermediate filaments to the desmosome. In contrast to null DESMOPLAKIN: mice which die in early development, the truncated protein due to the homozygous 7901delG mutation in humans is not embryonic lethal.

We also noted enlarged skeletal muscle fibres, brown fat necrosis and calcification of cardiac tissue. In liver and muscle, loss of the major regulatory isoform caused a great decrease in expression and activity of class IA Pi3k catalytic subunits; nevertheless, homozygous mice still displayed hypoglycaemia, lower insulin levels and increased glucose tolerance.

The presence of calcineurin, the RyR and FK506-binding protein (FKBP)12.6 in rat cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was identified by Western blot analysis. The possible interactions between calcineurin, the RyR and FKBP12.6 were further studied by co-immunoprecipitation using CHAPS-solubilized cardiac-membrane fractions (CSMFs) or SR preparations. Physical interactions between the RyR and calcineurin were found in the CSMF in the presence of added 100 microM Ca(2+); however, the interactions were interrupted in the presence of 20 mM EGTA, 1 microM rapamycin or 1 microM FK506, suggesting that the interaction is Ca(2+)-dependent, and is mediated by FKBP12.6. The Ca(2+)-dependent interaction between FKBP12.6 and the RyR was also found by co-immunoprecipitation. Effects of calcineurin inhibitors were tested on neonatal-rat-heart cardiomyocytes. Treatment of neonatal cardiomyocytes with 20 microM deltamethrin, 10 microM cyclosporin A (CsA), or 10 mciroM FK506 led to Ca(2+) oscillations in originally quiescent cardiomyocytes. Preincubation of cardiomyocytes with 20 microM rapamycin which dissociates FKBP12.6 from the RyR, evoked Ca(2+) oscillations, probably due to the leakiness of the RyR. However, Ca(2+) oscillations by rapamycin were not further affected by 10 microM CsA or 10 mciroM deltamethrin, suggesting that only RyR-associated calcineurin could regulate the channel activities. In spontaneously Ca(2+)-oscillating cardiomyocytes, CsA or FK506 treatments increased the frequency of oscillations. In 10 microM ryanodine-treated cardiomyocytes, CsA failed to induce Ca(2+) oscillations. These data show evidence that calcineurin associated with the RyR could modulate Ca(2+) release in rat heart.", "journal": "The Biochemical journal", "date": "2000-11-04", "authors": ["ABandyopadhyay", "D WShin", "J OAhn", "D HKim"], "doi": null}

Traditional studies typically use a monocular imaging setup, thus limiting investigation to a restricted region of tissue. However, studies of large-scale wavefront dynamics, especially those during fibrillation and defibrillation, would benefit from visualization of the entire epicardial surface. To solve this problem, a panoramic cardiac visualization algorithm was developed which performs the two tasks of reconstruction of the surface geometry of the heart, and representation of the panoramic fluorescence information as a texture mapping onto the geometry that was previously created. This system permits measurement of epicardial electrodynamics over a geometrically realistic representation of the actual heart being studied. To verify the accuracy of the algorithm, the procedure was applied to synthetic images of a patterned ball; further verification was provided by application of the algorithm to a model heart placed in the experimental setup. Both sets of images produced mean registration image errors on the order of 2 pixels, corresponding to roughly 3 mm on the geometry.

SM alpha-actin also appears during vascular development, but becomes the single most abundant protein in adult vascular smooth muscle cells. Tissue-specific expression of SM alpha-actin is thought to be required for the principal force-generating capacity of the vascular smooth muscle cell. We wanted to determine whether SM alpha-actin gene expression actually relates to an actin isoform's function. Analysis of SM alpha-actin null mice indicated that SM alpha-actin is not required for the formation of the cardiovascular system. Also, SM alpha-actin null mice appeared to have no difficulty feeding or reproducing. Survival in the absence of SM alpha-actin may result from other actin isoforms partially substituting for this isoform. In fact, skeletal alpha-actin gene, an actin isoform not usually expressed in vascular smooth muscle, was activated in the aortas of these SM alpha-actin null mice. However, even with a modest increase in skeletal alpha-actin activity, highly compromised vascular contractility, tone, and blood flow were detected in SM alpha-actin-defective mice.

Exogenous BK at a nanomolar concentration was incubated alone, in the presence of an ACE inhibitor (ramiprilat, 36 nM), or in the presence of a VPI (omapatrilat, 61 nM) with left ventricular membranes prepared from normal donor hearts (n = 7), and hearts from patients with an ischemic (n = 11) or dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy (DCM). The half-lives calculated for BK alone (199 +/- 60, 224 +/- 108, and 283 +/- 122 s; P = NS) exhibited similar values for normal, ischemic, and DCM heart tissues, respectively. Ramiprilat significantly increased the half-life of BK (P <.01), but the effect was similar for the three kinds of tissues (297 +/- 104, 267 +/- 157, and 407 +/- 146 s, respectively; P = NS). The potentiating effect of the VPI omapatrilat on the kinetic parameter of BK (478 +/- 210, 544 +/- 249, and 811 +/- 349 s, respectively) was greater than that of the ACE inhibitor (P <.01). Moreover, omapatrilat had a more important potentiating effect with DCM than normal heart membranes (P <.05). These results show that not only ACE but also and mainly NEP play an important role in the degradation of BK in human heart membranes.

{"title": "Troponin I: an update on clinical utility and method standardization.", "abstract": "Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is now widely recognized as one of the preeminent biochemical markers for the diagnosis of myocardial injury. The biochemical specificity of this biomolecule for cardiac tissue has forced a reevaluation of the diagnostic criteria for non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, acute coronary artery disease, and minor myocardial injury. Further, its use by clinicians has revolutionized the way that chronic and acute heart diseases are both diagnosed and managed. Unfortunately, the standardization of cardiac troponin I assays is problematic. Up to 20-fold variation of serum cTnI mass determinations may be observed for a given patient sample when measured by different assay systems. As a result, significant ambiguity often exists in the clinical interpretation of serum cTnI concentrations. Recent efforts have been directed toward the biochemical standardization of cTnI assays. However, the heterogeneous nature and biochemical complexity of the serum forms of cTnI and differences of the epitope recognition by the various methods have hindered the harmonization of serum cTnI assays.", "journal": "Annals of clinical and laboratory science", "date": "2000-10-25", "authors": ["J PLaurino"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Distinct patterns of cytokine gene suppression by the equivalent effective doses of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in rat heart allografts.", "abstract": "In vitro studies of the mode of action of cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus have indicated that both drugs produce immunosuppression by a quite similar cellular and molecular mechanism to block T cell receptor emanated transcriptional activation of interleukin(IL)-2 and other cytokine genes. Herein, we show that there are distinct patterns of cytokine gene expression in rat heart allografts under equivalent effective doses (\"optimal dose\") of CsA and tacrolimus. The optimal doses of CsA (10 mg/kg/day) and tacrolimus (3.2 mg/kg/day), which induce similar mean graft survival time (MST), were administered in LEW recipients with ACI heart grafts from day 0 after grafting until sacrifice. Heart grafts were harvested at days 3, 5, and 7. The expression of various cell surface markers, cytokines, and cytotoxic factors was determined by immunohistology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RFT-PCR). Cell populations that stained positively in the heart tissues of allograft control increased through day 7 for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, NKR-Pla+ natural killer (NK) cells, and ED2+ macrophages. CsA and tacrolimus have comparable activity to block these cell local infiltrations. The mRNA levels of the majority of the factors were dramatically up-regulated in the allografts over time, peaking at day 5. The optimal doses of CsA and tacrolimus had similar inhibitory effects on Th1 type cytokine IL-2 and interferon [INF]-gamma), inflammatory cytokine (IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), and cytotoxic factor (granzyme B and perforin) mRNA expression. However, the drugs had different effect on Th2 type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). Whereas IL-4 expression was not affected by tacrolimus and was enhanced by CsA, IL-10 expression was more significantly suppressed by tacrolimus than CsA. Differences in the suppression of Th2 type cytokine gene expression indicate that the in vivo molecular networks by which CsA and tacrolimus exert their full immunosuppressive activity are not necessarily the same.", "journal": "Immunobiology", "date": "2000-10-25", "authors": ["HJiang", "XYang", "R NSoriano", "TFujimura", "KKrishnan", "MKobayashi"], "doi": "10.1016/S0171-2985(00)80034-0"}

Normal thyroid tissue contained GM3, GD3, and GD1a as the major gangliosides, with GM1, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b in lesser amounts. The goitrous tissue of PTU-induced hypothyroid rats had higher concentrations of GM1 and GD1a with a concomitant decrease of GM3. The amount of GT3 in thyroid tissue was increased in hypothyroid animals. While normal liver tissue had a complex ganglioside pattern with a- and b-series gangliosides, the PTU-induced hypothyroid tissue showed a simpler ganglioside profile that consisted mainly of a-series gangliosides with almost undetectable amounts of b-series gangliosides. The expression of c-series gangliosides was suppressed in the hypothyroid liver tissue. Heart tissue had higher contents of GM3 and GT3 than control. No apparent change was observed in the compositions of major and c-series gangliosides in other extraneural tissues (i.e., kidney, lung, spleen, thymus, pancreas, testis, skeletal muscle, and eye lenses), and neural tissues (i.e., cerebrum and cerebellum) from PTU-induced hypothyroid rats.

Cardiac SR preparations from human, canine and ovine tissues were compared using [(3)H]ryanodine binding, channel reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers and Western blot analysis involving RyR antibodies. [(3)H]ryanodine binding assays revealed a K(d)value of; 2.5 n M for all investigated cardiac tissues. Bound [(3)H]ryanodine was Ca(2+)-dependent with similar EC(50)values of 0.43, 0.49 and 0.79 microM for human atrium, canine ventricle and ovine atrium, respectively. However the density of binding sites was 4.5 times lower in atrial than in ventricular tissues. Beyond the presence of selective K(+)channels (gamma=188 pS) recorded in the SR enriched fraction of human atrium, the activity of a large conducting (gamma=671 pS) cationic channel was also observed. The latter displayed typical characteristics of Ca(2+)-release channels which were activated by 10 microM free [Ca(2+)] and 2 m M ATP. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of the RyR2 isoform in atrial and ventricular samples whereas no immunoreactivity was detected with specific RyR1 and RyR3 antibodies.

Human frataxin (fxn) is severely reduced in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a frequent autosomal recessive neuro- and cardio-degenerative disease. Whereas the function of fxn is unknown, the yeast frataxin homolog (Yfh1p) has been shown to be involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from free radical toxicity. Evidence of iron accumulation and oxidative damage in cardiac tissue from FRDA patients suggests that fxn may have a similar function, but whether yeast and human frataxin actually have interchangeable roles in mitochondrial iron homeostasis is unknown. We show that a wild-type FRDA cDNA can complement Yfh1p-deficient yeast (yfh1 delta) by preventing the mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative damage associated with loss of Yfh1p. We analyze the functional effects of two FRDA point mutations, G130V and W173G, associated with a mild and a severe clinical presentation, respectively. The G130V mutation affects protein stability and results in low levels of mature (m) fxn, which are nevertheless sufficient to rescue yfh1 delta yeast. The W173G mutation affects protein processing and stability and results in severe m-fxn deficiency. Expression of the FRDA (W173G) cDNA in yfh1 delta yeast leads to increased levels of mitochondrial iron which are not as elevated as in Yfh1p-deficient cells but are above the threshold for oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA and iron-sulfur centers, causing a typical yfh1 delta phenotype.

The only classic MLCK detected in cardiac tissue, purified cardiac myocytes, and in a cardiac myocyte cell line (AT1) was identical to the 130-kDa smooth muscle MLCK (smMLCK). A complex pattern of MLCK expression was observed during differentiation of skeletal muscle in which the 220-kDa-long or \"nonmuscle\" form of MLCK is expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts. Subsequently, during myoblast differentiation, expression of the 220-kDa MLCK declines and expression of this form is replaced by the 130-kDa smMLCK and a skeletal muscle-specific isoform, skMLCK in adult skeletal muscle. These results demonstrate that the skMLCK is the only tissue-specific MLCK, being expressed in adult skeletal muscle but not in cardiac, smooth, or nonmuscle tissues.

{"title": "An unknown endogenous inhibitor of Na/Ca exchange can enhance the cardiac muscle contractility.", "abstract": "The cardiac sarcolemma Na/Ca exchanger is a key system for controlling the intracellular calcium levels during the excitation-contraction coupling. Here, we test the hypothesis that the heart tissue contains a putative endogenous factor having a capacity to modulate the Na/Ca exchanger and muscle contractility. The concentrated cardiac extracts inhibit the Na(i)- or Ca(i)-dependent (45)Ca uptakes in isolated cardiac sarcolemma vesicles as well as the Na(o)-dependent Ca efflux, monitored by extravesicular Ca probe fluo-3. The inhibitory activity has been purified approximately 2000-fold by normal and reversed-phase HPLC procedures. The inhibitory activity is eluted from the Sephadex G-10 in the range of 350-550 Da, suggesting that the inhibitory factor is a low-molecular-weight substance. The mass spectra analysis shows a number of signals within m/z 380-560; however, it is not clear at this moment whether these recordings represent the mass of putative inhibitory factor or irrelevant impurities. The endogenous inhibitory factor of Na/Ca exchange does not resemble the properties (HPLC retention time, mass spectra, amino acid analysis, etc.) of autoinhibitory XIP peptide. The addition of inhibitory factor to muscle strip of guinea pig ventricles induces 2- to 5-fold enhancement of isometric contractions, thereby exhibiting a strong positive inotropic effect. This effect is a dose-dependent phenomenon, which can be reversed by washing the inhibitory factor from the organ bath. Assuming a molecular weight of 350-550 Da, the effective concentrations of putative inhibitor must be <10(-6) M.

The immunization of BALB/c mice with R13 synthetic peptide coupled to a carrier protein (OVA) induces specific (anti-R13) and autoreactive (anti-H13 and anti-heart) antibodies as well as heart functional alterations. Since aged human and experimental animals are impaired in their responses to most foreign antigens but they produce greater amounts of autoantibodies, in this work we used aged mice as an experimental model able to exaggerate the autoimmune component of the R13-induced response in case it was present. We studied whether these antibodies generated in the absence of the parasite would induce pathological changes in heart tissues. The levels of antibodies against R13 (foreign antigen) and H13 (autoantigen) studied comparatively in 2- and 12-month-old mice 10 days after the third immunization with R13 coupled to OVA were, as we expected for a foreign antigen, higher in almost all sera from 2-month-old mice tested than in sera from 12-month-old mice. Besides, these specific and cross-reactive antibody response remain elevated as long as 150 days post third immunization. In addition, the isotype pattern that recognizes R13 and the self-sequence H13 showed no differences between sera from young and aged mice. Moreover, when ECG traces were obtained from immunized mice, the heart functional alterations observed at 10 days continued at 80 and 150 days after the third immunization, showing an association with the levels of antibodies.

For two- and three-dimensional problems, the computations tend to take a prohibitively long time. This study develops a computationally efficient and accurate approximation of the bidomain model: a \"reduced bidomain\" model. The approximation is based on the fact that during a strong shock, the extracellular field in the muscle changes only slightly and, therefore, can be approximated by an activating function, following the concept introduced by Rattay (Rattay, F. Analysis of models for external stimulation of axons. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 33:974-977, 1986). The activating function used here is time-dependent and is computed using an iterative algorithm. The results show that in two spatial dimensions, the \"reduced bidomain\" model, as implemented in this study, cuts the computational cost by two orders of magnitude while preserving most properties of the \"full bidomain\" model. It faithfully represents the spatial pattern and the temporal development of the muscle polarization.

{"title": "Mechanisms of discordant alternans and induction of reentry in simulated cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "T-wave alternans, which is associated with the genesis of cardiac fibrillation, has recently been related to discordant action potential duration (APD) alternans. However, the cellular electrophysiological mechanisms responsible for discordant alternans are poorly understood.\nWe simulated a 2D sheet of cardiac tissue using phase 1 of the Luo-Rudy cardiac action potential model. A steep (slope >1) APD restitution curve promoted concordant APD alternans and T-wave alternans without QRS alternans. When pacing was from a single site, discordant APD alternans occurred only when the pacing rate was fast enough to engage conduction velocity (CV) restitution, producing both QRS and T-wave alternans. Tissue heterogeneity was not required for this effect. Discordant alternans markedly increases dispersion of refractoriness and increases the ability of a premature stimulus to cause localized wavebreak and induce reentry. In the absence of steep APD restitution and of CV restitution, sustained discordant alternans did not occur, but reentry could be induced if there was marked electrophysiological heterogeneity. Both discordant APD alternans and preexisting APD heterogeneity facilitate reentry by causing the waveback to propagate slowly.\nDiscordant alternans arises dynamically from APD and CV restitution properties and markedly increases dispersion of refractoriness. Preexisting and dynamically induced (via restitution) dispersion of refractoriness independently increase vulnerability to reentrant arrhythmias.

Drug effects on ischaemia-induced arrhythmias were assessed simultaneously in the same rabbits. Lidocaine, infused at 2.5, 5 and 10 micromol kg(-1) min(-1) i.v., accelerated and worsened the electrophysiological derangement caused by ischaemia, had profibrillatory actions and reduced the time to the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) relative to controls. Tedisamil, infused at 0.063, 0.125 and 0.25 micromol kg(-1) min(-1) i.v., prolonged MAP duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD(90%)) before induction of ischaemia in a dose-related manner; however, this effect was not maintained 5 min after induction of ischaemia. Tedisamil had no significant antiarrhythmic actions over the dose-range tested. RSD1019, infused at 2, 4 and 8 micromol kg(-1) min(-1) i.v., produced a small increase in MAPD(90%) before induction of ischaemia and only at the highest dose tested. In contrast to tedisamil, RSD1019 suppressed ischaemia-induced MAP shortening assessed 5 min after induction of ischaemia. This effect was dose-related. RSD1019 completely prevented ischaemia-induced tachyarrhythmias at the mid and highest infusion levels tested. The results of this study illustrate a pathologically targeted approach for preventing ischaemia-induced arrhythmias.

The pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although it is possible that protein adduct formation by reactive metabolites of ethanol may be a contributory process. Hitherto, this has only been tested with respect to antibodies against reduced-acetaldehyde protein adducts in clinical studies, despite the fact that during alcohol toxicity the formation of reduced-acetaldehyde, unreduced-acetaldehyde, malondialdehyde, malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde and hydroxyethyl protein adducts have been reported in non-cardiac tissues. It was our hypothesis that the heart is particularly sensitive to the formation of protein adducts in alcohol toxicity.To test this hypothesis, we analysed hearts from rats fed nutritionally complete liquid diets containing ethanol as 35% of total calories for 6 weeks, using the Lieber-DeCarli pair-feeding protocol. Control rats were treated identically and fed the same diet in which ethanol was replaced by isocaloric glucose. At the end of the feeding period, the hearts were dissected and ventricular muscle analysed. After 6 weeks' ethanol feeding, ELISA analysis showed increased amounts of reduced-acetaldehyde protein adducts (p < 0.01) unreduced-acetaldehyde (p < 0.01) and malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (p= 0.01) protein adducts. However, malondialdehyde and alpha-hydroxyethyl-protein adducts were not significantly increased in hearts of ethanol-fed rats compared to pair-fed control (p > 0.1 in both instances).

To further confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of dietary treatment with BH(4) on endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation and vascular oxidative stress in the aortas of insulin-resistant rats. Oral supplementation of BH(4) (10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) for 8 weeks significantly increased the BH(4) content in cardiovascular tissues of rats fed high levels of fructose (fructose-fed rats). Impairment of endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation in the aortic strips of the fructose-fed rats was reversed with BH(4) treatment. The BH(4) treatment was associated with a 2-fold increase in eNOS activity as well as a 70% reduction in endothelial O(2)(-) production compared with those in fructose-fed rats. The BH(4) treatment also partially improved the insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as the serum triglyceride concentration, in the fructose-fed rats. Moreover, BH(4) treatment of the fructose-fed rats markedly reduced the lipid peroxide content of both aortic and cardiac tissues and inhibited the activation of 2 redox-sensitive transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB and activating protein-1, which were increased in fructose-fed rats. The BH(4) treatment of control rats did not have any significant effects on these parameters.

The results were the following: 1) a high degree of head-tail interaction produces oscillations in several AP properties; 2) Ca(2+)-transient oscillations are in phase with AP duration oscillations and are often of greater magnitude; 3) as the wave front propagates around the pathway, AP properties undergo periodic spatial oscillations that produce complicated temporal oscillations at a single site; 4) depending on the degree of head-tail interaction, intracellular [Na(+)] accumulation during reentry either stabilizes or destabilizes reentry; and 5) elevated extracellular [K(+)] destabilizes reentry by prolonging the tail of postrepolarization refractoriness.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Luo-Rudy dynamic (LRd) membrane equations were used because they include detailed formulations for triggered SR Ca2+ release dependent on membrane Ca2+ influx (CICR) and for spontaneous SR Ca2+ release following calsequestrin buffer overload (SCR). Reentry's rapid rate (110-ms cycle length) elevated [Ca2+]i and limited CICR, which in turn promoted SCR that occurred at intervals of 320-350 ms, was preferential at sites located inside the functional center, and destabilized the reentrant activation sequence. Although adjustment of LRd parameters for SR Ca2+ modified SCR interval and peak [Ca2+]i in voltage clamp simulations with a command waveform representing Vm time course within the functional center, SCR persisted. Using the same command waveform, SCR also occurred with an alternate SR Ca2+ formulation that represented subcellular details underlying CICR. LRd parameter adjustments to promote CICR and limit SCR in subsequent reentry simulations failed to eliminate SCR completely, as they modulated SCR intervals in a manner consistent with the voltage clamp simulations. Taken together, our findings support a destabilizing influence of functional reentry on [Ca2+]i handling. However, [Ca2+]i instabilities did not always fractionate depolarization wavefronts during reentry. Fractionation depended, in part, upon CICR and SCR parameters in the LRd formulation for SR Ca2+ release.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2000-09-29", "authors": ["A EPollard", "L MLit", "J MRogers"], "doi": "10.1109/10.867955"}
{"title": "Turkey knockdown in successive flocks.", "abstract": "Turkey knockdown was diagnosed in three of five flocks of hen turkeys on a single farm within a 12-mo period. The age of birds in the flocks affected ranged from 6 wk 2 days to 7 wk 4 days. The attack rate ranged from 0.02% to 0.30% with a case fatality rate in affected birds ranging from 0 to 74%. The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical signs and histopathologic lesions associated with knockdown. The feed in all flocks contained bacitracin methylene disalicylate and monensin (Coban). Affected birds were recumbent, demonstrated paresis, and were unable to vocalize. Postmortem examination revealed few significant lesions although pallor of the adductor muscles and petechiation in adductor and gastrocnemius muscles were noted. Birds that had been recumbent for extended periods were severely dehydrated. Consistent microscopic lesions included degeneration, necrosis, and regeneration of adductor, gastrocnemius, and abdominal muscles. No lesion in cardiac tissue was noted. Results of our investigation indicated that changes in water consumption, vitamin E status, and brooder to finisher movement correlated with the occurrence of knockdown. Turkey knockdown was defined in 1993 as any condition identified in a turkey flock that has affected the neuromuscular system to a degree that a turkey is unable to walk or stand. This definition was later modified to...neuromuscular or skeletal systems to a degree that a turkey is unable to walk or stand properly. Knockdown may be associated with numerous feed, management, or disease factors alone or in combination. Dosage of monensin, feed restriction/gorging, water restriction, heat stress, copper, mycotoxins, sodium chloride in feed, and sulfa drugs have all been suggested as contributing factors; however, laboratory studies to duplicate this have not been successful.

However, the time course in this gene expression in the adjacent and remote left ventricular, or right ventricular myocardium after myocardial infarction has not been well examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the left ventricular function and regional cardiac gene expression after myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction was produced in Wistar rats by the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 3 weeks, 2 months and 4 months from myocardial infarction, we performed Doppler echocardiography and measured the systolic and diastolic function. Then, we analyzed the contractile protein, extracellular matrix and intracellular Ca2+ transport protein mRNAs of cardiac tissues in the adjacent and the remote noninfarcted myocardium, and right ventricular myocardium by Northern blot hybridization. Fractional shortening of infarcted heart progressively decreased. Peak early diastolic filling wave (E wave) velocity increased, and the deceleration rate of the E wave velocity was more rapid in myocardial infarction areas. Atrial filling wave (A wave) velocity decreased, resulting in a marked increase in the ratio of E wave to A wave velocity. Expression of myocardial alpha-skeletal actin, beta-MHC and ANP mRNA, or collagen I and III mRNA were higher at 3 weeks after myocardial infarction. SR Ca2+-ATPase mRNA in the adjacent non-infarcted myocardium was decreased at 2 months, and that in remote myocardium was decreased at 4 months after infarction. Na+-Ca2+ exchanger mRNA levels were increased at 3 weeks, but was decreased at 2 months in the adjacent non-infarcted myocardium and at 4 months in the remote myocardium.

In the absence of GATA binding sites, synergistic activation depends on binding of SRF to the proximal CArG box sequence in the cardiac and skeletal alpha-actin promoter. GATA-4's C-terminal activation domain is obligatory for synergistic coactivation with SRF, and its N-terminal domain and first zinc finger are inhibitory. SRF and GATA-4 physically associate both in vivo and in vitro through their MADS box and the second zinc finger domains as determined by protein A pullout assays and by in vivo one-hybrid transfection assays using Gal4 fusion proteins. Other cardiovascular tissue-restricted GATA factors, such as GATA-5 and GATA-6, were equivalent to GATA-4 in coactivating SRE-dependent targets.

It plays a key role particularly in excitation contraction coupling in myocytes in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Three isoforms of the SR Ca2+ release channel have been cloned. Recently coexpression of different isoforms was reported in different animal species and various tissues. In human cardiac tissue, however, isoform expression is not yet established. Therefore the aim of this study was to characterize isoform expression of the SR Ca2+ release channel in the human heart. We examined specific isoform expression of mRNA and proteins of the SR Ca2+ release channel in the four different chambers of the heart and the interventricular septum from explanted human hearts from nonfailing organ donors (n=8). Reverse transcriptase PCR from total cardiac RNA with isoform specific primers and western blots from myocardial homogenates with isoform specific antibodies were performed. Quantification of protein expression was achieved by densitometric scanning and computer analysis and is expressed as densitometric units per microgram of protein. A single band DNA signal was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR for the skeletal isoform 1 and the cardiac isoform 2 and isoform 3 in all regions of the human heart investigated. Specific protein expression was detected in all five myocardial regions of the human heart in western blots for the skeletal isoform I and cardiac isoform 2, and a weaker specific band was also detectable for isoform 3 of the SR Ca2+ release channel. Quantification of protein expression showed significant (P=0.008) lower expression of isoform 1 in the right ventricle (42+/-4 densitometric units/g tissue) and similar expression in all other regions (right atrium 58+/-3; septum 51+/-5, left atrium 54+/-5; left ventricle 51+/-6). Isoform 2 of the SR Ca2+ release channel was also significantly lower (P=0.001) in the right ventricle (33+/-4 densitometric/g tissue) and similar in the other heart chambers (right atrium 42+/-5: septum 41+/-3, left atrium 52+/-6, left ventricle 42+/-3). Differences in isoform 3 of the SR Ca2+ release channel for the various myocardial regions did not reach significant levels (right atrium 45+/-6, right ventricle 38+/-5, septum 49+/-8, left atrium 46+/-7, and in left ventricle 45+/-3 densitometric units/g tissue). In conclusion, all three isoforms of the SR Ca2+ release channel were determined in the human heart at both mRNA and protein levels with different quantitative expression in the different heart chambers.

A 'noninvasive' technique for causing localized tissue damage to relieve hemodynamic and life-threatening obstruction in patients with congenital cardiac anomalies could replace more invasive procedures.

It differs from Cbeta in the first 15 N-terminal residues which are replaced with a 62-residue domain with no similarity to other known proteins. The Cbeta2 protein was identified in cardiac tissue by MS, microsequencing and C-subunit-isoform-selective antibodies. The Cbeta2 protein has a very low abundance of about 2% of total affinity-purified C subunits from bovine cardiac tissue. This, and the similarity of its biochemical properties to Calpha and Cbeta, are probably some of the reasons why the Cbeta2 protein has escaped detection so far. The abundance of the Cbeta2 protein differs dramatically between tissues, with most protein detected in heart, liver and spleen, and the lowest level in testis. Cbeta2 protein shows kinase activity against synthetic substrates, and is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor peptide PKI(5-24). The degree of Cbeta2 removal from tissue extracts by binding to PKI(5-24) depends on the cAMP level, i.e. on the dissociation state of the holoenzyme. Two sites in the protein are phosphorylated: Thr-244 in the activation segment and Ser-385 close to the C-terminus. By affinity purification and immunodetection Cbeta2 was found in cattle, pig, rat, mouse and turkey tissue and in HeLa cells. In the cAMP-insensitive CHO 10260 cell line, which has normal Cbeta but is depleted of Calpha, stable transfection with Cbeta2 restored most of the cAMP-induced morphological changes.

Single ventricular myocytes from rat hearts were voltage clamped using the whole cell patch configuration and an EGTA-containing pipette solution to record the Ca(2+)-independent, 4-aminopyridine sensitive component of I(to). 300 microM Cd(2+) or 10 microM nifedipine was used to block I(Ca). 3.

The inhibition of I(to) by halothane was concentration-dependent (K(0.5), 1.1+/-0.2 mM). 4. One mM halothane led to a 16 mV shift in the steady-state inactivation curve towards negative membrane potentials (P:=0.005, n=8) but had no significant effect on the activation-voltage relationship (P:=0. 724).

Halothane induced a shift in the steady-state inactivation curve and accelerated the inactivation process of I(to) which could be responsible for its inhibitory effect. 6.

An adverse accumulation of extracellular matrix structural protein compromises tissue stiffness and adversely affects myocardial viscoelasticity, this leads to ventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Hormonal factors, such as chronic, inappropriate (relative to dietary salt intake and intravascular volume) elevations in circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone, are accompanied by fibrosis of right and left sides of the heart. Hemodynamic factors regulate cardiac myocyte work and their adaptive hypertrophic growth. The relative contributions of hormonal and hemodynamic factors in regulating growth of muscular and nonmuscular compartments must form the basis for the selection of pharmacologic intervention that will optimize the management of symptomatic heart failure that accompanies hypertensive heart disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cardioprotective strategies that prevent alteration of normal cardiac tissue structure by fibrosis and appearance of abnormal ventricular stiffness (viscoelasticity) are based on negating the generation of these hormones or interfering with their receptor-ligand binding. A regression of established cardiac fibrosis and improvement in abnormal ventricular stiffness is feasible. Experimental and clinical findings with lisinopril in hypertensive heart disease, where cardiac fibrosis and abnormal ventricular stiffness are present, indicate that such cardioreparation should be a targeted objective of pharmacologic intervention. Systematic analysis of this approach using a controlled clinical trial format is warranted. In recognizing the importance of viscoelastic elements in regulating the mechanical behavior of cardiac tissue, and in turn systolic and diastolic ventricular function, a broader tissue compartment based paradigm (ECM versus myocyte) for the management of heart failure emerges.", "journal": "Cardiology clinics", "date": "2000-09-15", "authors": ["B SBurlew", "K TWeber"], "doi": "10.1016/s0733-8651(05)70154-5"}

In order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic approach, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay has been developed to detect the mRNA encoding cardiac troponin I from myocardial cells hypothetically released from damaged cardiac tissue. The detection is specific for cardiac troponin I mRNA, with no amplification of homologous sequences of other troponin I isoforms, i.e., troponin I from skeletal muscle cells. However, a strong amplification signal for cardiac troponin I mRNA was detected in samples of peripheral blood from healthy human volunteers.

Development of organs such as the heart depends on dynamic interactions across cell surfaces. Fibronectin (FN), for example, a glycoprotein that links the ECM to the cytoskeleton through integrin surface receptors, is required for normal heart development. Thus, altered gravity may perturb organogenesis. We cultured precardiac explants from chick embryos in a rotating bioreactor vessel to simulate microgravity (microG), or in a tissue culture centrifuge, for 18 h during heart development. Bioreactor microG did not alter external morphology of explants, but did significantly reduce the proportion that developed contractions. Immunostaining for FN of explant sections showed that it also significantly reduced the linear extent of staining present in basement membrane regions. Analysis of ultrastructure revealed a significant reduction in the number of desmosomes per unit area and other differences.

Immunohistochemical data show that monocytes/macrophages (MCs/Mphs) drill tunnels using the broad-spectrum mouse macrophage metalloelastase. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and neo-endothelial markers present in the microvasculature of MCP-1 mouse hearts suggest an active angiogenic process. Further studies will be required to establish that the MC-/Mph-drilled tunnels evolve to become capillaries, connected to the existing vessels and colonized by circulating endothelial cell progenitors. This possibility is supported by the availability of these cells, which is demonstrated by cell tagging with beta-galactosidase placed under an active endothelial Tie-2 promoter.

For members of the delta-CaMKII subclass with both variable domains (subclass II), weak transcriptional expression of isoforms delta(2) and delta(3) was found in the heart.

Nitric oxide (NO) modulating effects on mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities in ischemic and reperfused tissue were investigated (preliminary report).\nDuring elective coronary artery bypass grafting, in 30 consecutive patients ventricle samples were taken one before aortic clamping the second after 55 +/- 8 min ischemic period and the third 34 +/- 5 after final reperfusion. Coronary sinus blood samples were taken in parallel to assess free radical release measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. In a small number of patients (N = 5) nitric oxide tissue levels were analyzed.\nWhen compared with normoxic tissue, a significant decrease in cytochrome oxidase (COX) and succinate Cyt-c reductase (SCR) activities in ischemic and reperfused samples were observed. The activation of HSP70-72 and c-fos transcription factor was evident in courses of ischemia and reperfusion. Blood MDA levels underline the concept that oxyradical generation characterizes peroxidative damage in reoxygenated myocardial tissue while adaptive changes which occur in ischemic cells seem to antagonize the oxyradical injury.\nIn the course of heart surgery the myocardial cell seems to prevent ischemic damage activating some peculiar biomolecular and biochemical adaptive changes which permit the reversibility of the oxidative injury. In contrast it appears evident that massive and rapid reoxygenation of the cardiac tissue leads to peroxidative damage due to oxyradical generation. Nitric oxide seems to play a crucial role in cellular adaptation to ischemia even if further studies will be needed to elucidate these findings.

{"title": "Concordant xenotransplantation--non-vascularized pancreatic islets are more difficult to regraft than the vascularized heart.", "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that it is possible to perform retransplantation of a xenogeneic heart (mouse-to-rat) using cyclosporine A as monotherapy, provided that the first heart is transplanted under a short course of deoxyspergualin (DSG). If DSG is omitted, the first heart is rejected within four days and the second heart succumbs to hyperacute rejection within minutes. A mouse heart as first graft does not protect a consecutive pancreatic islet graft, although the heart continues to function after rejection of the cellular graft. One explanation for this discrepancy may be the fact that cellular grafts, as pancreatic islets, lack an endothelial lining. We have, therefore, further investigated possible differences between vascularized and non-vascularized xenografts regarding their capacity to induce unresponsiveness. The use of pancreatic islets as primary graft neither accelerated nor decelerated the speed of rejection of the vascularized heart used as secondary graft. Furthermore, hemagglutinating and cytotoxic antibody titres responded in the same manner as in naive rats transplanted with a mouse heart. Retransplantation with pancreatic islets also resulted in complete rejection of both the primary and secondary grafts. Thus, the lack of unresponsiveness cannot simply be explained by differences, between the pancreatic and cardiac tissues, in antigen expression. In addition, intraperitoneal transplantation of mouse heart cells as primary graft resulted in rejection of a secondary cardiac graft after three days. However, it cannot be totally excluded that the time of antigen exposure had an impact on these results. In conclusion, our previous and present studies suggest that the presence of an intact vascular bed, both in the first and second graft, is necessary to create a state of unresponsiveness. Because the pancreatic islets lack an endothelial lining, they do not benefit from an unresponsiveness of the immune system.

The most vital tissues (heart, brain, gill, and muscle) showed the greatest Hsp90-mRNA response, with heart tissue increasing approximately 35-fold. Heat shock induced no increase in plasma cortisol.

It is not known whether specific components of the regulatory pathway involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2), are activated in copper deficiency. Little is known about gene expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in hearts of copper-deficient rats. Male weanling rats were fed copper-adequate (CuA), copper-deficient (CuD) or pair-fed (CuP) diets for 5 wk. Mitochondria and lipid droplet volume densities from electron micrographs were greater and there was an elevation in the mtTFA protein level in hearts of copper-deficient rats. DNA binding activities of NRF-1 and NRF-2 did not differ among the groups. Northern blot analysis of cardiac tissue revealed that transcripts of F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase subunit c were greater, but mRNA levels of ATP synthase beta subunit and the FAO enzyme, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), were lower in hearts of copper-deficient rats. Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) mRNA levels did not differ among treatment groups. These results suggest that certain components of the mitochondrial biogenesis program are activated in hearts of copper-deficient rats.

The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons. Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The smallest BAH-related transcript (2,789 base pairs) uses an alternative 3' terminal exon, resulting in a protein lacking a catalytic domain. Evolutionary conservation of this noncatalytic isoform of BAH (humbug) is demonstrated in mouse, man, and Drosophila. Monoclonal antibody reagents were generated, epitope-mapped, and used to definitively correlate RNA bands on Northern blots with protein species on Western blots. The gene for mouse junctin, a calsequestrin-binding protein, was cloned and characterized and shown to be encoded from the same locus. When expressed in heart tissue, BAH/humbug preferably use the first exon and often the fourth exon of junctin while preserving the reading frame. Thus, three individual genes share common exons and open reading frames and use separate promoters to achieve differential expression, splicing, and function in a variety of tissues.

{"title": "MITF: a stream flowing for pigment cells.", "abstract": "Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a transcription factor with a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) structure. Mutations of the MITF gene cause a variety of phenotypes, most notably in pigmented cells, in several species. In humans, haploinsufficiency of MITF causes Waardenburg syndrome type 2, while a dominant-negative mutation causes Tietz syndrome. Four isoforms have been cloned so far: MITF-M is the most abundant and is expressed in neural-crest-derived melanocytes; MITF-A is expressed in various cultured cells including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and enriched in RPE of embryonal and developing eyes; MITF-H are expressed in many types of cultured cells and in the heart tissue; MITF-C is expressed in many types of cultured cells, but not in melanocytes. Many growth factor signaling pathways have been implicated for regulation of MITF at both protein and promoter levels. Most notably, Steel factor/c-Kit signaling pathway was linked to phosphorylation of MITF at Ser73 and Ser409 through activation of MAP kinase and RSK-1, respectively. Phosphorylation of MITF is also conducted at Ser298 through GSK3beta, although the signaling pathway for this event still remains to be elucidated. IGF-1 and HGF/SF pathways may merge with the c-Kit signaling pathway. WNT and MSH signaling pathways regulate MITF positively at the promoter level. Endothelins may regulate MITF at the protein and promoter levels.

The percentage of ionized serum magnesium was unproportionally high in rats fed a low magnesium (70 ppm) diet. Femoral magnesium was correlated with ionized and total serum magnesium. In contrast, there was generally no correlation between total serum magnesium and the magnesium fractions in skeletal muscle, heart and liver. In rats fed the magnesium deficient diet, total cardiac concentration of magnesium was even significantly increased along with total calcium content, while there were no effects on total muscle and liver magnesium. Within the single groups, ionized serum calcium was never proportional to dietary magnesium, but in all three magnesium diet groups together, it was inversely correlated with dietary magnesium. Moreover, ionized serum calcium was inversely correlated with both ionized and total serum magnesium. In all 3 groups together, the concentrations of total calcium and magnesium in heart and skeletal muscle were correlated, within the single groups correlation existed only in the 1000 ppm group. Magnesium influx via calcium channels during low magnesium intake has been seen in non cardiac tissues [35,36], but nothing similar is known about non selective channels for divalent cations in the heart [33]. Thus, magnesium uptake by cardiac cells along with calcium seems to be possible, especially at low intracellular magnesium concentrations, but is still poorly investigated.

In an effort to further this understanding, this study identifies two endogenous substrates for P450 2D18. Previous reports have shown that this isoform is expressed in the rat brain, and the recombinant enzyme catalyzes the N-demethylation of the antidepressants imipramine and desipramine. By further examining the substrate profile of P450 2D18, inferences can be made as to potential endogenous P450 substrates. Herein we demonstrate the metabolism of the central nervous system-acting compounds chlorpromazine and chlorzoxazone with turnover numbers of 1.8 and 0. 9 nmol/min/nmol, respectively. Because the four aforementioned pharmaceutical substrates work by binding to neurotransmitter receptors, binding assays and oxidation reactions were performed to test whether dopamine is a substrate for P450 2D18. These data indicate a K(S) value of 678 microM and that P450 2D18 can support the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome through a peroxide-shunt mechanism. We also report the P450 2D18-mediated omega-hydroxylation and epoxygenation of arachidonic acid, primarily leading to the formation of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, compounds that have been shown to have vasoactive properties in brain, kidney, and heart tissues. The data presented herein suggest a possible role for P450 involvement in membrane and receptor regulation via epoxyeicosatrienoic acid formation and a potential involvement of P450 in the oxidation of dopamine to reactive oxygen species under aberrant physiological conditions where the sequestering of dopamine becomes compromised, such as in Parkinson's disease.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2000-08-17", "authors": ["C MThompson", "J HCapdevila", "H WStrobel"], "doi": null}

For simulated data, conduction velocities were estimated with an accuracy of 1%-2%. In experimental data, estimates of conduction speeds during paced rhythm were slower than those found during normal sinus rhythm. Vector directions were also found to differ between different types of beats. The technique was able to distinguish between premature ventricular contractions and sinus beats and between sinus and paced beats.

In addition to classical adrenal production of aldosterone, endogenous tissue production of aldosterone has been observed in various organs; aldosterone biosynthesis in cardiac tissues, however, remains highly controversial. The current study provides a comprehensive evaluation of steroid hormone biosynthethic capabilities in multiple tissues from two distinct rat strains under unstimulated and stimulated conditions. Panels of tissues from Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats were probed for 11 beta-hydroxylase (P45011beta) and aldosterone synthase (P450aldo) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Under unstimulated conditions, cardiac P45011beta and P450aldo were detected only in Wistar rats. Angiotensin II (100 microg/day) stimulated myocardial expression of both enzymes in both strains. Cerebral cortex and mesenteric artery message levels in both strains was reduced by angiotensin II. These data demonstrate the potential for local steroid synthesis in vascular, cardiac, renal, and neuronal tissues, and that biosynthesis of non-adrenal aldosterone may be differentially regulated between strains.

We tested the hypothesis that the development of CVB-induced myocarditis is linked to CVB-induced pancreatitis by studying the replication of different CVB strains in mice. Eight of nine genotypically different type 3 CVB (CVB3) strains induced acute pancreatitis in mice; of these, three viruses also induced acute myocarditis. One CVB3 strain was avirulent for both organs. Myocarditis was not observed in the absence of pancreatitis. The results obtained by inoculation of mice with strains of other CVB serotypes were consistent with these data. Infectious virus titers were measured in serum, pancreas, and heart as a function of time after inoculation of mice with three CVB3 strains. Each strain was representative of one of the three viral virulence phenotypes: avirulent, pancreovirulent only, and cardiovirulent. All strains replicated well and persisted in the pancreas through 8 days post-inoculation, but the cardiovirulent CVB3 strain tended to replicate to higher titer earlier and persist longer in sera, pancreatic, and cardiac tissues than the noncardiovirulent strains. Replication of the CVB3 strains were studied in two human pancreatic tumor lines and in primary human endothelial cell cultures derived from cardiac artery. Cardiovirulent strains, both individually and as a group, tended to replicate to titers as high as, or higher than, noncardiovirulent strains did in cell culture.

{"title": "Iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin: implications for Friedreich ataxia.", "abstract": "Frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease. Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes. Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1p) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA. These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. The functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p (mYfh1p) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer (13,783 Da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1. 1 MDa (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13+/-2 nm. Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester >3,000 atoms of iron. Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight >600,000. After addition of (55)Fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain >16 atoms of (55)Fe per molecule of mYfh1p.

Pacing period (Tp) was decreased from 275 +/- 25 msec to 75 +/- 25 msec and then increased to 230 +/- 70 msec in steps of either 5 or 10 msec. In all 21 trials in six sheep, the atrium responded 1:1 at longer Tps and 2:1 at shorter Tps. As Tp was decreased, the response switched to 2:1 at a particular Tp. Conversely, as Tp was increased, the response switched back to 1:1 at a particular Tp. Over 21 trials, the 1:1-to-2:1 and 2:1-to-1:1 transitions occurred at 119.5 +/- 18.8 msec and 130.0 +/- 19.1 msec, respectively. This hysteretic behavior yielded bistability windows, 10.5 +/- 7.2 msec wide, wherein 1:1 and 2:1 responses existed at the same Tp. In 15 trials and in all animals, idiopathic wavefronts emanating from outside the mapped region passed through the mapped region. In 13 of those trials, the idiopathic wavefronts occurred at Tps within the bistability window or within 35 msec of its upper or lower limit.\nBistability windows and idiopathic wavefronts were observed and found to be correlated with each other, suggesting a connection between bistability and arrhythmogenesis.", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology", "date": "2000-08-02", "authors": ["R AOliver", "G MHall", "SBahar", "WKrassowska", "P DWolf", "E GDixon-Tulloch", "D JGauthier"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1540-8167.2000.tb00051.x"}

Template was prepared from (1) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from 10 healthy unrelated Caucasian volunteers; (2) PBMCs isolated from 6 leukemic patients (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], n = 3; chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], n = 1; chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], n = 2); and (3) samples of 4 leukemic cell lines (ALL: CEM, MOLT4; AML: KG1a; CML: K562). NHE1 cDNA in normal PBMCs showed silent polymorphism of nucleotides 112 (N1: T, frequency 0.70; C, frequency 0.30; prevalence of heterozygosity 0.42); 2248 (N2: G, frequency 0.90; A, frequency 0. 10; heterozygosity 0.18); and 2493 (N3: G, frequency 0.90; A, frequency 0.10; heterozygosity 0.18). Deduced primary structure of NHE1 protein in all normal volunteers was identical to that previously published for NHE1 from renal and cardiac tissue. Similar to normal PBMCs, NHE1 cDNA from leukemic cells showed polymorphism of nucleotides N1, N2, and N3, but failed to demonstrate leukemia-specific sequence differences. We conclude that the coding region of NHE1 cDNA shows a greater level of polymorphism than is currently recognized, but that sequence mutation of NHE1 is not a key event in the pathogenesis of leukemia.", "journal": "Cancer genetics and cytogenetics", "date": "2000-07-29", "authors": ["O AGarden", "PMusk", "D AWorthington-White", "M JDewey", "I NRich"], "doi": "10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00246-0"}
{"title": "Two-dimensional Chebyshev pseudospectral modelling of cardiac propagation.", "abstract": "Bidomain or monodomain modelling has been used widely to study various issues related to action potential propagation in cardiac tissue. In most of these previous studies, the finite difference method is used to solve the partial differential equations associated with the model. Though the finite difference approach has provided useful insight in many cases, adequate discretisation of cardiac tissue with realistic dimensions often requires a large number of nodes, making the numerical solution process difficult or impossible with available computer resources. Here, a Chebyshev pseudospectral method is presented that allows a significant reduction in the number of nodes required for a given solution accuracy. The new method is used to solve the governing nonlinear partial differential equation for the monodomain model representing a two-dimensional homogeneous sheet of cardiac tissue. The unknown transmembrane potential is expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomial trial functions and the equation is enforced at the Gauss-Lobatto grid points. Spatial derivatives are obtained using the fast Fourier transform and the solution is advanced in time using an explicit technique. Numerical results indicate that the pseudospectral approach allows the number of nodes to be reduced by a factor of sixteen, while still maintaining the same error performance. This makes it possible to perform simulations with the same accuracy using about twelve times less CPU time and memory.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2000-07-27", "authors": ["ZZhan", "K TNg"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02347052"}
{"title": "Roles and relationship of macrophages and monocyte chemotactic and activating factor/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the ischemic and reperfused rat heart.", "abstract": "Reperfusion injury is a troublesome and unresolved problem in acute myocardial infarction and is believed to be associated with inflammatory reactions in which various types of cells and cytokines participate, in particular, macrophages and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). We designed this study to clarify the role and relationship of macrophages and MCP-1 in ischemic and reperfused heart. The number and distribution of macrophages and MCP-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the ischemic and reperfused rat heart were examined with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Myocardial samples were obtained at several times. In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe for rat MCP-1 mRNA, and immunohistochemistry was performed with antimacrophage antibody. Double staining with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry was also performed. The number of MCP-1 mRNA-positive cells increased after reperfusion and peaked at 3 hours after reperfusion. Early infiltration of ischemic tissues by macrophages was also observed at the time of the absence of an increase of MCP-1 mRNA-positive cells, and this infiltration was not significantly accelerated by reperfusion, but by ischemia itself. The numbers of both MCP-1 mRNA-positive cells and macrophages increased in the ischemic marginal region over time. From the result of double staining, and based on the cellular morphology and the distribution, the majority of MCP-1 mRNA-positive cells appeared to be activated macrophages. This suggests that macrophages may not be attracted to cardiac tissue only by MCP-1 and that MCP-1 may have some roles other than attracting macrophages into ischemic heart. It also suggests that macrophages and MCP-1 may play an important role in reperfusion injury and that MCP-1 may be one of the key molecules of reperfusion injury.

Twenty-four lambs were exposed during three 5-wk periods to either thermoneutral, control (W; 23+/-2 degrees C) or cold (C; 0+/-2 degrees C) temperatures and were fed either ad libitum (A) or restricted (R) levels of feed intake, resulting in four treatment groups: WA, WR, CA, and CR. Hearts, kidneys, and livers were harvested at slaughter and binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to plasma membrane extracts was used to determine densities (B(MAX)) and binding affinities (Kd) of beta1 and beta2 adrenoceptors. The B(MAX) values ranged from 12.10 to 201.26 and 3.38 to 12.30 fmol/mg protein for beta1 and beta2 adrenoceptors, respectively; heart and kidney had the highest and lowest values, respectively. Feed restriction reduced (P < .05) beta1 and beta2 receptor densities in heart but increased (P < .05) beta1 receptor density in kidney and liver. Cold temperature exposure reduced beta1 receptor density in heart tissue during feed restriction. The Kd values, ranging from 1.32 to 5.98 nM, were increased (P < .05) by cold exposure and feed restriction in kidney and liver. Because the effectiveness of hormones is a function of their concentrations, binding affinities, and their receptor densities, these results imply that cold temperature exposure and feed restriction could potentially reduce (in heart) and increase (in kidney and liver) metabolic responsiveness of tissues to catecholamines.", "journal": "Journal of animal science", "date": "2000-07-25", "authors": ["E DEkpe", "J AMoibi", "R JChristopherson"], "doi": "10.2527/2000.7871907x"}

The lesions observed in mice resemble closely those seen in the human disease. Experimental murine models of CVB3-induced myocarditis have shown that both, host and viral genetic factors, can influence susceptibility to the infection as well as the persistence and progression of the disease. Recently, we have shown that CD4 T cell-deficient MHC Class II knockout mice develop a strong fibrosis with virus persistence in the heart tissue and without production of neutralizing antibodies. To examine the role of CD4+ T cells and especially the role of the T helper 1 cell response for the outcome and pathogenesis of CVB3-induced myocarditis in more detail, 2 different mouse strains with identical genetic background (H-2b) were infected with CVB3-M\u00fc/J (Nancy strain). Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice and mice with targeted disruption of interleukin (IL-)4 gene (IL-4-/- mice) developed a severe acute myocarditis on day 7 post infection (p.i.). The CVB3-induced inflammation was cured until the 21st day p.i. in hearts of C57BL/6 mice. IL-4-/- mice with insufficient T helper-2 cell immune response developed a severe myocardial damage between day 7 and 21 p.i. with prolonged virus persistence in the heart tissue.

{"title": "Cardiac rhythm and conduction disturbances: what is the role of autoimmune mechanisms?", "abstract": "The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated. Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area. The incidence of autoantibodies to human conducting tissue has been analyzed in sick sinus syndrome, bradyarrhythmia, and hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome. Patients with anti-sinus node antibodies (ASNab) have a 10-fold higher risk of developing sick sinus syndrome, compared to age-matched controls. The risk of acquiring an atrioventricular block was up to 3-fold in patients with anti-atrioventricular node antibodies (AAVNab) in comparison to controls. The incidence of anti His antibodies (AHISab) was low both in patients and controls. Anti-cardiac Purkinje cell antibodies (ACPCab) seemed to be an epiphenomenon and not a pathogenetic marker of conduction disorders. In congenital heart block association with HLA-B27 and HLA-DR3 is a possible prerequisite in the pathophysiology of the disease, although transplacental passage of various antibodies and immune complexes is widely recognized. The main autoantibodies detected both in children with congenital heart block and their mothers are anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. The cross-reactivity of laminin with anti-La antibodies could be important in the initiation of the autoimmune process. Autoantibodies against adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of neonatal heart and human endogenous retrovirus-3 expressed in fetal cardiac tissue could also play a role in the pathogenesis of the congenital heart block. Of note, apoptosis could be one of the possible mechanisms of the progression of the congenital conduction disturbances to the complete heart block. In addition, evidence is compiling that cellular activation and cellular cytotoxicity specific for a given target tissue appears to be at least equally important in the pathogenesis of the disease as the humoral response. In conclusion, the immunopathogenesis of certain cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders is well established in sick sinus syndrome, congenital heart block, and connective tissue diseases.

In order to clarify whether an altered ANT isoform composition might be responsible for the restricted ANT function, we analyzed the ANT isoform expression pattern in the myocardium of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy. The ANT isoform mRNA pattern was analyzed in explanted hearts from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 29), ischemic (n = 22) and valvular cardiomyopathy (n = 7) using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Myocardium from 12 subjects without heart disease was used as control. In addition, right ventricular biopsies from 47 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac catheterization were tested. A shift in the ANT isoform transcription profile was found in heart tissue from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, but not in those from patients with ischemic or valvular cardiomyopathy. The shift was characterized by an increase in the ANT1 mRNA percentage, a decrease in ANT2 and an unchanged ANT3 proportion. Both ventricles and the septum were affected by the shift. The alteration was also found in endomyocardial specimens taken from patients with ongoing dilated cardiomyopathy. An alteration in the ANT isoform pattern was found to be specific for dilated cardiomyopathy. It is not a general phenomenon of end-stage heart failure, but occurs already before the heart is finally damaged.

There was no significant difference in the levels of total antioxidant capacity, retinol, urea, albumin or triglyceride in plasma from SHR or WKY rats, with or without lisinopril or amlodipine treatment. However in SHR rats, levels of alpha-tocopherol were substantially reduced in both plasma (-54% WKY, P<0.01) and cardiac tissue (-43% WKY, P<0.05). Treatment with lisinopril ameliorated reduced levels of plasma alpha-tocopherol in SHR rats, but not in cardiac tissue. Amlodipine treatment had no effect on alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma or cardiac tissue in SHR rats. In SHR rats total cholesterol levels were significantly lower thanWKY controls (-36%, P<0.001). This effect was reversed in lisinopril treated SHR rats (+27%, P<0.01). Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were reduced in untreated SHR rats (P<0.025) when compared to WKY controls; neither lisinopril nor amlodipine treatment significantly altered these parameters.

{"title": "Induction of cardiac fibrosis by aldosterone.", "abstract": "An intracardiac aldosterone system which responds to short- and long-term physiological stimuli has been described. This cardiac generated aldosterone has possibly autocrine or paracrine actions. Normal cardiac tissue contains mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and cardiac high affinity MR are localized in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells. Data concerning the presence of MR in cardiac fibroblasts are, however, controversial. MR are not specific for aldosterone but they also bind glucocorticoids. Cardiac fibroblasts however contain the enzyme 11beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase II which converts these glucocorticoids to inactive metabolites. Discordant findings on the in vitro effect of aldosterone on the collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts are reported and can at least partly attributed to the presence of various fibroblasts phenotypes. During chronic aldosterone infusion in uninephrectomized rats on a high-salt diet, a marked accumulation of interstitial and to a lesser extent perivascular collagen occurs in the heart in both ventricles. This cardiac fibrosis in this aldosteronism model is prevented by spironolactone. This effect of aldosterone is crucially dependent on the salt status of the rat. Indeed, rats on a restricted salt intake infused with aldosterone had no cardiac fibrosis above control levels. During the continuous infusion of aldosterone in the rat the appearance of fibrosis was delayed and starts 4 weeks after the beginning of the infusion which argues against a direct effect of aldosterone. The mechanism of aldosterone-salt induced cardiac fibrosis possibly involves angiotensin II acting through upregulated AT1 receptors and the cardiac AT1 receptor is the target for aldosterone. An accumulation of collagen in the heart has also been found in patients with adrenal adenomas and during chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as in surgically induced unilateral renal ischemia, unilateral renal artery banding or renovascular hypertension. Spironolactone prevents aortic collagen accumulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In patients with stable chronic heart failure spironolactone treatment in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduced circulating levels of procollagen type III N-terminal aminopeptide. Also, in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study spironolactone coadministered with conventional therapy of ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics and digitalis in patients with symptomatic heart failure defined as NYHA classes III-IV reduces total mortality by 30%.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2000-07-11", "authors": ["PLijnen", "VPetrov"], "doi": "10.1006/jmcc.2000.1129"}

At a concentration of 10 microg/ml, the aqueous FC extract resulted in 50% inhibition of SAP kinase activity in ischemic heart tissue. Our results showed that FC affected both the interaction of SAP kinase with c-jun as well as the phosphotransferase reaction.

Although ADR generates free radicals, the role of these radicals in the development of cardiac toxicity is still not well understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of glutathione (GSH) supplementation or depletion on ADR-induced cardiotoxicity in male Wistar rats. Cardiac toxicity was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of ADR (20 mg kg(-1)) and manifested by an increase in heart rate, blood pressure elevation, and increased serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The extent of lipoprotein oxidation, lipid peroxide measured as malondialdhye (MDA), total homocysteine (tHcy), lipid profile, and atherogenic index were markedly elevated, whereas cardiac GSH content was dramatically decreased in ADR rats. Pre- and co-treatment of ADR rats with GSH (5 mm kg(-1)) (ADR +GSH) markedly reduced the levels of CK, LDH, lipoprotein oxidation susceptibility, cardiac MDA, tHcy and atherogenic index, and elevated GSH levels in cardiac tissues. In contrast, GSH depletion through administration of l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) (15 mm kg(-1)) before and after ADR injection (ADR +BSO) greatly exacerbated ADR cardiotoxicity compared to the control and ADR groups. Finally, there were also severe cardiac histopathological changes in ADR and ADR +BSO groups, which were nearly restored by GSH treatment.

{"title": "Pharmacological properties of Ca(V)3.2, a low voltage-activated Ca2+ channel cloned from human heart.", "abstract": "Three genes encoding T-type Ca2+ channels have been described but their correspondence to the various native T-type Ca2+ currents remains uncertain. In particular, Ca(V)3.2 (or alpha1H) was cloned from a human heart library, its message was found abundantly in cardiac tissue, and expressed Ca(V)3.2 was shown to conduct low voltage-activated currents, which inactivate rapidly and are sensitive to Ni2+ and mibefradil. These observations suggested that Ca(V)3.2 might encode native cardiac T-type Ca2+ channels but more information on the pharmacology of Ca(V)3.2 was needed to confirm this hypothesis. In the present study, we compare the pharmacology of Ca(V)3.2 expressed in HEK293 cells and of native T-type Ca2+ channels in guinea pig atrial myocytes (\"native-T\"). (1) Ca(V)3.2 and native-T are insensitive to TTX and to toxins selective for N-, P-, or Q-type Ca2+ channels (omega-CTx-GVIA, omega-Aga-IVA, omega-CTx-MVIIC). (2) The half-maximal blocking concentration (IC50) of mibefradil on Ca(V)3.2 is near that on native-T and the block is similarly voltage-dependent. (3) Ca(V)3.2 is five- to sixfold less sensitive than native-T to the 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) amlodipine, suggesting a difference in the DHP binding site. (4) Both channels display similar (but not identical) sensitivities to the inorganic blockers Ni2+ and Cd2+ and the IC50s are in the range of values found for T-type Ca2+ currents in other cell types.

{"title": "Cardiac peroxynitrite formation and left ventricular dysfunction following doxorubicin treatment in mice.", "abstract": "Selective cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin remains a significant and dose-limiting clinical problem. The mechanisms involved have not been fully defined but may involve the production of reactive oxygen species and/or alteration of cardiac energetics. Here, we tested the hypotheses that doxorubicin causes left ventricular dysfunction in mice and is associated with dysregulation of nitric oxide in cardiac tissue, leading to the accumulation of 3-nitrotyrosine (a biomarker of peroxynitrite formation). Animals were dosed with doxorubicin (20 mg/kg i.p.), and left ventricular performance was assessed in vivo using M-mode and Doppler echocardiography. Five days after doxorubicin administration, left ventricular fractional shortening, cardiac output, and stroke volume parameters were significantly reduced relative to control values (30.0 +/- 3.6 versus 46.1 +/- 1. 6%, 8.9 +/- 0.9 versus 11.5 +/- 0.6 ml/min, and 21.2 +/- 0.1 versus 29.5 +/- 0.1 microl for doxorubicin versus control, P <.05). Statistically significant (P <.05) increases in the immunoprevalence of myocardial inducible nitric oxide synthase (33 +/- 18 versus 9 +/- 2%, via quantitative image analysis) and 3-nitrotyrosine formation (56 +/- 24 versus 0.3 +/- 0.4%) were also observed after doxorubicin. Correlation analyses revealed a highly significant inverse relationship between left ventricular fractional shortening and cardiac 3-nitrotyrosine immunoprevalence (P <.01). No such relationship was observed for inducible nitric oxide synthase. Western blot analyses of cardiac myofibrillar fractions revealed extensive nitration of an abundant 40-kDa protein, shown to be the myofibrillar isoform of creatine kinase. These data demonstrate that alteration of cardiac nitric oxide control and attendant peroxynitrite formation may be an important contributor to doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, nitration of key myofibrillar proteins and alteration of myocyte energetics are implicated.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2000-06-28", "authors": ["D MWeinstein", "M JMihm", "J ABauer"], "doi": null}

Western blot analysis for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was performed on the stellate ganglion from both groups.\nRelative to the control group, the exercise group demonstrated typical exercise adaptations of increased ventricular weight/body weight ratio, enhanced skeletal muscle citrate synthase activity and higher concentrations of [3H]ouabain binding sites in both skeletal and cardiac tissue (P<0.05). The increase in heart rate (bpm) with SNS significantly decreased in the exercise group (n=16) compared to the sedentary group (n=16) from 30+/-5 to 17+/-3 bpm at 1 Hz; 67+/-7 to 47+/-4 bpm at 3 Hz; 85+/-9 to 63+/-4 bpm at 5 Hz and 101+/-9 to 78+/-5 bpm at 7 Hz stimulation (P<0.05). The increase in heart rate with cumulative doses (0.1-10 microM) or a single dose (0.1 microM) of bath-applied norepinephrine expressed as the effective doses at which the HR response was 50% of the maximum response (EC50) were similar in both exercise (EC50 -6.08+/-0.16 M, n=8) and sedentary groups (EC50 -6.18+/-0.07 M, n=7). Trained animals had significantly more nNOS protein in left stellate ganglion compared to the sedentary group. In the exercise group, the non-isoform selective NOS inhibitor, N-omega nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 100 microM) caused a small but significant increase in the heart rate response to SNS. However, the positive chronotropic response to sympathetic nerve stimulation remained significantly attenuated in the exercise group compared to the sedentary group during NOS inhibition (P<0.05).\nOur results indicate that there is a significant peripheral pre-synaptic component reducing the HR response to sympathetic activation following training, although NO does not play a dominant role in this response.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2000-06-28", "authors": ["R MMohan", "J KChoate", "SGolding", "NHerring", "BCasadei", "D JPaterson"], "doi": "10.1016/s0008-6363(00)00066-3"}

Because the membrane-associated complement inhibitors are very effective, recombinant soluble molecules have been generated.\nWe tested the efficacy of complement activation blocker-2 (CAB-2), a recombinant soluble chimeric protein derived from human decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), in two models of pig-to-human xenotransplantation in which tissue injury is complement mediated. The in vitro model consisted of porcine aortic endothelial cells and human serum, and the ex vivo model consisted of a porcine heart perfused with human blood.\nIn vitro, addition of CAB-2 to serum inhibited cytotoxicity and the deposition of C4b and iC3b on the endothelial cells. Ex vivo, addition of CAB-2 to human blood prolonged organ survival from 17.3 +/- 6.4 min in controls to 108 +/- 55.6 min with 910 nM (100 microg/ml) CAB-2 and 219.8 +/- 62.7 min with 1820 nM (200 microg/ml) CAB-2. CAB-2 also retarded the onset of increased coronary vascular resistance. The complement activity of the perfusate was reduced by CAB-2, as was the generation of C3a and SC5b-9. The myocardial tissues had similar deposition of IgG, IgM, and Clq; however, CAB-2 reduced the deposition of C3, C4, and C9. Hearts surviving >240 min demonstrated trace to no deposition of C9 and normal histologic architecture.\nThese results indicate that CAB-2 can function as an inhibitor of complement activation and markedly reduce tissue injury in models of pig-to-human xenotransplantation and thus may represent a useful therapeutic agent for xenotransplantation and other complement-mediated conditions.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2000-06-27", "authors": ["T JKroshus", "C TSalerno", "C GYeh", "P JHiggins", "R MBolman", "A PDalmasso"], "doi": "10.1097/00007890-200006150-00011"}

There was a 6-fold increase of the membrane/cytosol ratio, and PKC activity in the membrane fraction was 4.2-fold compared with wild-type mice.

{"title": "Reduction of cardiac volume in left-breast treatment fields by respiratory maneuvers: a CT study.", "abstract": "A previous study of healthy female volunteers suggested that deep inspiratory breath holding can reduce the cardiac volume in the treatment portals for left-breast cancer treatment. The reduction of irradiated cardiac volume may be important considering the reported late cardiac morbidity and mortality and the frequent coexistent use of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. In the present study, we evaluated the heart volume in the fields and, thus, the true benefit of this respiratory maneuver in breast cancer patients undergoing CT simulation.\nFifteen patients (median age, 53) were studied. For each patient, CT scans were performed both when the patient breathed normally (quiet respiration) and when the patient held her breath after a deep inspiration. Tangential fields were planned using the same medial, lateral, superior, and inferior borders on skin for the normal breathing and the breath-holding configurations. The cardiac and left-lung volumes within the tangential fields were calculated for both breathing configurations. Multiple scan series were performed for the breath-holding configuration to provide a more accurate delineation of the cardiac tissue and to study the reproducibility of the patient's position between different cycles of deep inspiration.\nNone of the patients had difficulty holding her breath for 20 s. The cardiac volume in the field was reduced (-86 +/- 24%; p < 0.001) when patients held their breath after a deep inspiration compared to when breathing normally. For 7 patients (47%), deep inspiration moved the heart completely out of the radiation fields. The expansion of the lung tissue due to deep inspiration also increased the absolute lung volume in the tangential fields (183 cm(3) vs 97 cm(3), p < 0.001). However, the fractional volume of the left lung in the field was essentially unchanged. For all but 1 patient, the maximum difference between the external body contours from different breath holding cycles was 5 mm and occurred at the lateral aspect of the breast. At the medial aspect, as indicated by the position of the midline marker, the variations were well within the currently accepted tolerance for patient positioning during tangential treatment.\nDeep-inspiration breath holding substantially reduces cardiac volume in the tangential fields for left-sided breast cancer treatment. The variation between patient positions at different cycles of breath holding was found to be reasonably small. Therefore, it appears feasible to reduce cardiac radiation by treating patients with intratreatment minifractions lasting 10-15 s while patients hold their breath.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2000-06-23", "authors": ["H MLu", "ECash", "M HChen", "LChin", "W JManning", "JHarris", "BBornstein"], "doi": "10.1016/s0360-3016(00)00512-5"}

Inoculation of mice with AP over a range of three nontoxic doses and in varying schedules did not reduce virus titres in heart tissues or ameliorate virus-induced cardiopathological alterations during acute disease.

Simultaneous intraperitoneal inoculation of AP at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight per mouse with purified CVB3 significantly increased ELISA titres of anti-CVB3 antibodies and the proportion of mice with these titres, compared with similar parameters in mice inoculated only with CVB3.

Based on the sequence homology, amino acid analysis, antibody reactivity, and calpain inhibition, HMWCaMBP has been identified as a homologue of the calpain inhibitor calpastatin. In the present study the expression of HMWCaMBP was investigated in normal and ischaemic human myocardium. Western blot analysis of normal human cardiac muscle extract with the polyclonal antibody raised against bovine HMWCaMBP indicated a prominent immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of 140 kD. HMWCaMBP was localized in the cytoplasm and myofilaments of cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of normal and ischaemic cardiac tissues indicated a decrease in the expression of HMWCaMBP in ischaemic tissues. These studies were further substantiated by immunohistochemical studies, indicating strong to moderate HMWCaMBP immunoreactivity in normal cardiac muscle and poor to negative immunoreactivity in ischaemic muscle. The results obtained from the rat ischaemic model suggested that the expression of cardiac HMWCaMBP was significantly decreased during ischaemia/reperfusion. In addition, micro-calpain and m-calpain expression was higher in ischaemic cardiac tissue samples than in normal controls. The calpain inhibitory activity of ischaemic cardiac tissues was significantly lower than normal cardiac tissue samples. In some cases of cardiac ischaemia, HMWCaMBP highlighted the contraction band necrosis seen at the margins of a myocardial infarct. In vitro, HMWCaMBP was proteolysed by micro-calpain and m-calpain.

{"title": "Canine coronary microvessel NO production regulates oxygen consumption in ecNOS knockout mouse heart.", "abstract": "We have previously shown that NO production by tissues following stimulation with bradykinin or other agonists can regulate oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle, heart and kidney. From those studies and from those using agonists, which classically release NO from blood vessels and which are unable to regulate tissue oxygen consumption in heart from ecNOS knockout mice, we concluded that vascular NO production is capable of regulating tissue oxygen consumption. The goal of these studies was to directly address the concept that NO production by blood vessels can regulate tissue oxygen consumption using a classical transfer paradigm. Microvessels, capable of producing NO, were prepared from canine hearts using a sieving technique, cardiac tissue was taken from mice lacking the ability to produce NO from ecNOS (ecNOS -/- mice) and tissue oxygen consumption measured in vitro using a Clark type electrode in a sealed chamber. Bradykinin (10(-7)to 10(-4)M) had no effect on tissue oxygen consumption when administered to heart from ecNOS -/mice as expected and no effect on oxygen consumption by isolated canine coronary microvessels (0+/-5% at 10(-5)M). However when coronary microvessels were co-incubated with heart from ecNOS -/- mice, bradykinin caused a dose dependent reduction in tissue oxygen consumption reaching a maximum of 44+/-10% at 10(-4)M. The effects of bradykinin were entirely abolished by L -NAME. The calculated concentration range for NO in these studies was 2.9 to 293 n M, within estimated physiologic range for the activity of NO on cytochrome oxidase.

Regulatory authorities (CPMP in Europe) have recently pointed out the necessity to assess most carefully the potential, especially of non-cardiovascular drugs, for QT interval prolongation. Different methodological approaches are presented in this paper and experimental protocols are suggested; limitations and advantages of the presently available in vitro and in vivo models are discussed. It appears that both in vitro and in vivo approaches are complementary. In particular it is pointed out that only the in vitro models using isolated cardiac tissues (Purkinje fibres or papillary muscles) enable assessment of the drug properties under low cardiac rhythm conditions.

{"title": "A theoretical model based upon mast cells and histamine to explain the recently proclaimed sensitivity to electric and/or magnetic fields in humans.", "abstract": "The relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and human health is more and more in focus. This is mainly because of the rapid increasing use of such EMFs within our modern society. Exposure to EMFs has been linked to different cancer forms, e.g. leukemia, brain tumors, neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, asthma and allergy, and recently to the phenomena of 'electrosupersensitivity' and 'screen dermatitis'. There is an increasing number of reports about cutaneous problems as well as symptoms from internal organs, such as the heart, in people exposed to video display terminals (VDTs). These people suffer from subjective and objective skin and mucosa-related symptoms, such as itch, heat sensation, pain, erythema, papules and pustules. In severe cases, people can not, for instance, use VDTs or artificial light at all, or be close to mobile telephones. Mast cells (MCs), when activated, release a spectrum of mediators, among them histamine, which is involved in a variety of biological effects with clinical relevance, e.g. allergic hypersensitivity, itch, edema, local erythema and many types of dermatoses. From the results of recent studies, it is clear that EMFs affect the MC, and also the dendritic cell, population and may degranulate these cells. The release of inflammatory substances, such as histamine, from MCs in the skin results in a local erythema, edema and sensation of itch and pain, and the release of somatostatin from the dendritic cells may give rise to subjective sensations of on-going inflammation and sensitivity to ordinary light. These are, as mentioned, the common symptoms reported from patients suffering from 'electrosupersensitivity'/'screen dermatitis'. MCs are also present in the heart tissue and their localization is of particular relevance to their function. Data from studies made on interactions of EMFs with the cardiac function have demonstrated that highly interesting changes are present in the heart after exposure to EMFs. One could speculate that the cardiac MCs are responsible for these changes due to degranulation after exposure to EMFs. However, it is still not known how, and through which mechanisms, all these different cells are affected by EMFs. In this article, we present a theoretical model, based upon observations on EMFs and their cellular effects, to explain the proclaimed sensitivity to electric and/or magnetic fields in humans.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2000-06-22", "authors": ["SGangi", "OJohansson"], "doi": "10.1054/mehy.1999.0923"}

Only two of four GATA consensus motifs identified within HCEK contributed to enhancer activity, and both of these sites were required for both cardiac and hematopoietic transcriptional activation. The expression profile of MafK significantly overlapped that of GATA-1 in hematopoietic cells and of GATA-4/-6 in cardiac tissues. Each of these GATA factors bound with high specificity to both of the critical GATA sites in HCEK. Hence, the mafK gene is regulated by different GATA proteins in the hematopoietic and cardiac compartments through the same two GATA-binding sites in HCEK.

Therefore, NOS and NO. synthesis were characterized in a rat heart model of endothelial injury and dysfunction induced by the detergent Triton X-100. Cardiac NO. formation was directly measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. NOS activity was determined by the L-[(14)C]arginine conversion assay. Western blots and immunohistology were applied to define the amounts of NOS present in heart tissue before and after Triton treatment. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed to assess intracellular NOS distribution. A short bolus of Triton X-100, 0.25%, abolished responses to histamine and calcium ionophore while preserving response to nitroprusside. Complete blockade of NO. generation occurred after Triton treatment, but NOS activity assayed with addition of exogenous substrate and cofactors was unchanged, and identical 135-kDa NOS bands were seen on Western blots, indicating that NOS was not removed from the heart or structurally damaged by Triton. Immunohistochemistry showed no change in NOS localization after Triton treatment, and immunoelectron microscopy revealed similar NOS distribution in the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. These results demonstrate that the endothelial dysfunction was due to decreased NO. synthesis but was not caused by loss or denaturation of NOS.

Stiffness of papillary muscles and aortic strips was determined from resting length-tension analyses and included steady-state characteristics, dynamic viscoelastic stiffness properties, and maximum tensile strength.

These results indicate that the power-law behavior of heart-rate variability is determined not only by extracardiac influences but also by components intrinsic to cardiac tissue. Furthermore, the presence of power-law behavior in monolayer cultures of cardiomyocytes suggests that beat-rate variability might be determined by the complex nonlinear dynamics of processes occurring at the level of the cellular network, eg, interactions among a large number of cell oscillators or metabolic regulatory systems.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2000-06-13", "authors": ["J PKucera", "M OHeuschkel", "PRenaud", "SRohr"], "doi": "10.1161/01.res.86.11.1140"}
{"title": "Micromanipulation by laser microbeam and optical tweezers: from plant cells to single molecules.", "abstract": "Complete manipulation by laser light allows precise and gentle treatment of plant cells, subcellular structures, and even individual DNA molecules. Recently, affordable lasers have become available for the construction of microbeams as well as for optical tweezers. This may generate new interest in these tools for plant biologists. Early experiments, reviewed in this journal, showed that laser supported microinjection of material into plant cells or tissues circumvents mechanical problems encountered in microinjection by fragile glass capillaries. Plant protoplasts could be fused with each other when under microscopical observation, and it was no major problem to generate a triple or quadruple fusion product. In the present paper we review experiments where membrane material was prepared from root hair tips and microgravity was simulated in algae. As many plant cells are transparent, it is possible to work inside living, intact cells. New experiments show that it is possible to release by optical micromanipulation, with high spatial resolutions, intracellular calcium from caged compounds and to study calcium oscillations. An example for avian cardiac tissue is given, but the technique is also suitable for plant cell research. As a more technical tool, optical tweezers can be used to spatially fix subcellular structures otherwise moving inside a cell and thus make them available for investigation with a confocal microscope even when the time for image formation is extended (for example at low fluorescence emission). A molecular biological example is the handling of chromosomes and isolated individual DNA molecules by laser microtools. For example, chromosomes can be cut along complex trajectories, not only perpendicular to their long axis. Single DNA molecules are cut by the laser microbeam and, after coupling such a molecule to a polystrene microbead, are handled in complex geometries. Here, the individual DNA molecules are made visible with a conventional fluorescence microscope by fluorescent dyes such as SYBRGreen. The cutting of a single DNA molecule by molecules of the restriction endonuclease EcoRI can be observed directly, i.e. a type of single molecule restriction analysis is possible. Finally, mechanical properties of individual DNA molecules can be observed directly.", "journal": "Journal of microscopy", "date": "2000-06-10", "authors": ["K OGreulich", "GPilarczyk", "AHoffmann", "GMeyer Zu H\u00f6rste", "BSch\u00e4fer", "VUhl", "SMonajembashi"], "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2818.2000.00698.x"}

The effects of time (0 to 360 minutes) on total iron concentrations, glutathione peroxidase activity, and cytotoxic aldehyde production in heart of mice (B6D2F1, n = 65) were first investigated following acute iron-loading (20 mg iron dextran i.p./mouse). In a subsequent experiment, the effects of dose (0 to 80 mg iron dextran i.p./mouse, n = 75) on the aforementioned parameters were investigated. Our results show that the concentrations of cytotoxic aldehydes: (1) significantly differ over-time, with corresponding increases in total concentrations of iron (r = 0.93, p < 0.001); and (2) increase parallel to the total dose of iron administered (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). Furthermore, dose-and time-dependent alterations to glutathione peroxidase activity are observed, which is most likely due to an acute up-regulation of the enzyme as an endogenous protective response to increased free radical activity in the heart subsequent to iron-loading. While no single mechanism is likely to account for the complex pathophysiology of acute iron-induced heart failure, our results shown that iron-loading can result in significant free radical generation, as quantified by cytotoxic aldehydes, in heart tissue of mice.

We immunized cardiomyopathic and normal hamsters by subcutaneous injection of bovine serum albumin in complete Freund's adjuvant, and assessed various tissues for both OPN RNA expression and granuloma formation. Cardiomyopathic hamsters expressed OPN, and formed granulomatous lesions, in heart tissue in both immunized and untreated animals. In addition, immunization induced expression of OPN in lung and lymph nodes of cardiomyopathic (but not normal) hamsters, and also induced granuloma formation in these organs. To test whether OPN expression could play a functional role in inducing granulomas, we produced an adenoviral vector containing the murine OPN gene, and introduced this vector intratracheally into the lungs of normal hamsters. The OPN-containing vector, but not the control vector, induced pulmonary granuloma formation.

We found that APD restitution is the major determinant of scroll wave behavior and that instabilities arising from APD restitution are the main determinants of scroll wave breakup in this cardiac model. We did not see a \"thickness-induced instability\" in the LR1 model, but a minimum thickness is required for scroll breakup in the presence of fiber rotation.

{"title": "Protection of ischemic rat heart by dantrolene, an antagonist of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel.", "abstract": "Cytosolic Ca2+ overload plays a major role in the development of irreversible injury during myocardial ischemia. Such overload is due at least in part to the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, we investigated whether dantrolene, a blocker of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel, may protect from ischemic injury. In binding experiments, we determined the effect of dantrolene on [3H]-ryanodine binding in rat cardiac tissue. In perfusion experiments, isolated rat hearts were perfused for 20 min in the working mode, in the presence of 0-45 microM dantrolene. The hearts were then subjected to 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of retrograde reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated on the basis of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and LDH release. The binding experiments showed that dantrolene displaced 4 nM [3H]-ryanodine with IC50 of 34 microM. In the perfusion experiments, tissue necrosis (i.e., TTC-negative tissue) averaged 28.3 +/- 1.6% of the ventricular mass under control conditions. Dantrolene was protective at micromolar concentrations: tissue necrosis decreased to 21.4 +/- 1.0% and 8.4 +/- 1.4% with 1 microM and 45 microM dantrolene, respectively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Similar results were obtained with regard to LDH release. At low concentrations (up to 4 microM), dantrolene did not produce any significant hemodynamic effect, except for a slight increase in coronary flow, whereas at higher concentration a negative inotropic effect was apparent. In conclusion, dantrolene reduced ischemic injury even at concentrations that did not affect contractile performance.

{"title": "Heart rate within male crayfish: social interactions and effects of 5-HT.", "abstract": "Behaviors, such as those that establish dominant and subordinate social status, are thought to be driven by various neuromodulators and hormones. In crustaceans, the level of serotonin (5-HT) in the hemolymph is correlated with degree of aggressiveness. The crustacean heart is neurogenic and is modulated by neural secretion of 5-HT in the hemolymph, which bathes the cardiac tissue. We discuss and present the results of measuring heart rate (HR) of crayfish during interactions, as an indication of their state of excitability. HR is the result of multiple influences: a cocktail of hormones and modulators. HR was monitored during the periods in which crayfish established aggressive and submissive social status, during sham injections, and following injections of various doses of 5-HT. Crayfish, during an interaction to establish social status, can increase HR. Both the aggressive and submissive crayfish can dampen their HR within seconds during a pause in the interaction, while still posturing in an aggressive or submissive state. Injections of 5-HT to obtain systemic levels of approximately 100 nM-10 microM increase HR substantially for hours. This suggests that aggressive interactions and the establishment of a dominant posture may not be related to large increases in the free concentrations of 5-HT within the circulating hemolymph, since a sustained HR is not observed in aggressive animals. Instead, the results may demonstrate that inhibitory cardiac regulation is present in the aggressors during interactions and that a regulator is possibly 5-HT.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

{"title": "[Mechanoelectrical feedback in the healthy heart and in the heart with pathologies].", "abstract": "The article discusses the issues of possible connection between mechanical phenomena in myocardium and the electrical processes. Not only cardiomyocytes, but also cardiac fibroplastic are considered as substratum for the mechanisms of mechano-electrical feedbacks. Cardiomyocytes and fibroplastic of healthy animals demonstrate the mechano-electrical feedbacks, which essentially mean that stretching of the cardiac tissue within the physiological limits to 2 mN changes the electrophysiological cell processes. Close to 90% repolarization potential of cardiomyocytes action the mechano-induced depolarization develops; over the background of depolarization, when it reaches the threshold values, extra potentials of action are generated. In fibroplastic, membrane mechano-induced hyperpolarization develops; as result of cellular interaction it may develop hyperpolarization of pacemaking cells of the right auricle and slow the cardiac rythm down. In case of a pathology, for instance, infarct of the left heart ventricle modification of electric cell activity was detected at quite low values of tissue stretching up to 0.2. mN. Mechano-induced depolarization of cardiomyocytes of animals affected by infarct develops at 50% level of repolarization phase of action potential, or at 90% of repolarization phase. In the former case development of mechano-induced depolarization coincides with the period of absolute cell refractering. Extra action potential develops immediately after the refractering phase when the mechano-induced depolarization shifts the membrane potential towards threshold values. In the latter case the mechano-induced depolarization transforms into extra action potential. With further stretching fibrillation develops. In fibroplastic the values of mechano-induced membrane hyperpolarization grow with greater scope of infarct damage. Magnitude of mechano-induced hyperpolarization of auricle fibroplastic taken from the animals with infarcts shows dependence on the period of remodelling if stretching is tissue is a standard parameter. With prolongation of the remodelling period the value of mechano-induced fibroplastic hyperpolarization diminishes.

Recently, we reported that alternative splicing of exon 9 was induced by low serum or acidic media in mouse myoblasts, and that this splicing required de novo protein synthesis of a negative regulatory factor (Ichida, M., Endo, H., Ikeda, U., Matsuda, C., Ueno, E., Shimada, K., and Kagawa, Y.

In the present report, we identified a cis-acting element on the muscle-specific alternatively spliced exon of F(1)gamma gene by an in vivo splicing system using cultured cells and transgenic mice. We constructed a F(1)gamma wild-type minigene, containing the full-length gene from exon 8 to exon 10, and two mutants; one mutant involved a pyrimidine-rich substitution on exon 9, whereas the other was a purine-rich substitution, abbreviated as F(1)gamma Pu-del and F(1)gamma Pu-rich mutants, respectively. Based on an in vivo splicing assay using low serum- or acid-stimulated splicing induction system in mouse myoblasts, Pu-del mutation inhibited exon inclusion, indicating that a Pu-del mutation would disrupt an exonic splicing enhancer. On the other hand, the Pu-rich mutation blocked muscle-specific exon exclusion following both inductions. Next, we produced transgenic mice bearing both mutant minigenes and analyzed their splicing patterns in tissues. Based on an analysis of F(1)gamma Pu-del minigene transgenic mice, the purine nucleotide of this element was shown to be necessary for exon inclusion in non-muscle tissue. In contrast, analysis of F(1)gamma Pu-rich minigene mice revealed that the F(1)gamma Pu-rich mutant exon had been excluded from heart and skeletal muscle of these transgenic mice, despite the fact mutation of the exon inhibited muscle-specific exon exclusion in myotubes of early embryonic stage.

{"title": "Inducible NO synthase activity in blood vessels and heart: new insight into cell origin and consequences.", "abstract": "Induction of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the vascular and cardiac tissue by several inflammatory stimuli may result in the production of large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) for a sustained period. Recent data obtained in the rat aorta in which iNOS was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have demonstrated that adventitial cells represent the main site of NO production. Adventitial-derived NO can exert an immediate down-regulatory effect on smooth muscle contraction (via activation of the cyclic GMP pathway) but may also initiate longer lasting effects through the formation of NO stores within the medial layer. One candidate for such NO stores are dinitrosyl non-heme iron complexes. Low molecular weight thiols interact with preformed NO stores and promote vasorelaxation by a cyclic GMP-independent mechanism involving the activation of potassium channels. In the heart, the induction of iNOS is involved in delayed protection against ischemia-reperfusion-induced functional damages. Recent data obtained with monophosphoryl lipid A, a non-toxin derivative of LPS, strongly suggest that iNOS-derived NO in the rat heart does not act as an immediate mediator of the cardioprotection but rather as a trigger of long-term protective mechanisms. Thus, the present data reveal the important role of adventitial cells as a site of iNOS expression and activity in intact blood vessels. The induction of adaptive mechanisms in the heart and the formation of releasable NO stores in blood vessels are examples of long-term consequences of iNOS induction. These new information are relevant for a better understanding of the circumstances in which NO overproduction by iNOS may play either a beneficial or deleterious role in these tissues.", "journal": "Physiological research", "date": "2000-05-11", "authors": ["BMuller", "A LKleschyov", "KGyorgy", "J CStoclet"], "doi": null}

Fgf and Vegf proteins were present within the cytoplasm of the cardiomyocytes, or around capillaries, 1 h, 1 week and 3 weeks after irradiation. Many TUNEL-stained cardiomyocyte nuclei were observed at 1 h, but they had decreased markedly at 1 week and had almost disappeared by 3 weeks after irradiation. Thus Fgf and Vegf were induced concomitantly with the decrease in the staining for endothelial AP by 20 Gy X irradiation, which also caused microeffects as indicated by TUNEL staining of many nuclei at 1 h postirradiation.", "journal": "Radiation research", "date": "2000-05-02", "authors": ["MGao", "HShirato", "KMiyasaka", "MKuwabara", "TKoyama"], "doi": "10.1667/0033-7587(2000)153[0540:iogfir]2.0.co;2"}

Experiments were conducted in a random and blind fashion on two sub species of Sechium edule. Both the pulp and the peel were examined for hypotensive activity. Water-soluble extracts were prepared from these components of the fruit and injected into anaesthetised rats. Various cardiovascular parameters were measured including heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and several ECG intervals. We report that all extracts tested produced a fall in blood pressure with little change in ECG intervals. Extract B produced the least change in heart rate with a fall in MAP of approximately 23 mmHg. Changes in heart rate with all extracts appeared to be minimal as an ED25 value could only be determined for extract A, and ED10 values could not be evaluated for extracts C and D. The mechanism(s) by which these extracts produce their hypotensive effects could not be determined in these preliminary experiments. However, it appears not to involve direct effects on cardiac tissue. This conclusion is based on the finding that it took a minimum of 10 to 15 seconds for the hypotensive action to manifest post bolus. Future experiments will be aimed at delineating the mechanism(s) involved in decreasing MAP.", "journal": "The West Indian medical journal", "date": "2000-04-29", "authors": ["E AGordon", "L JGuppy", "MNelson"], "doi": null}

Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was elevated and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) formation were significantly increased. 4. Pretreatment with ramiprilat induced cardioprotection against DPPH and *O2- free radical injury. Cardiac functions (LVDP, LVEDP and +/-dP/dt(max)) were significantly improved. Both LDH and TBARS were reduced. 5. HOE 140 (a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist), calphostin C (a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor) and indomethacin (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) all abolished the cardiac protective effect of ramiprilat.

Little is known about how tissue-specific patterns of intercellular junctions are established and regulated. To elucidate the relationship between gap junction channel protein expression and the structure of gap junctions, we analyzed Cx43 +/- mice, which have a genetic deficiency in expression of the major ventricular gap junction protein, connexin43 (Cx43). Quantitative confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that diminished Cx43 signal in Cx43 +/- mice was due almost entirely to a reduction in the number of individual gap junctions (226 +/- 52 vs. 150 +/- 32 individual gap junctions/field in Cx43 +/+ and +/- ventricles, respectively; P < 0.05). The mean size of an individual gap junction was the same in both groups. Immunofluorescence results were confirmed with electron microscopic morphometry. Thus when connexin expression is diminished, ventricular myocytes become interconnected by a reduced number of large, normally sized gap junctions, rather than a normal number of smaller junctions.

Spontaneous contractile rates of adult RA were inhibited more than senescent RA by CPA. Contractility (+dF/dt) of adult LA was reduced more than senescent LA by CPA. Left trabeculae carnae tissue responded weakly to CPA, but senescent tissue was less responsive than adult tissue. Senescent atrial A(1) receptor density was 56% greater than in adult tissue, whereas the density in senescent ventricles was 39% lower than in adult tissue. No significant difference in antagonist affinities (K(d)) of A(1) receptor was observed between adult and senescent atria. In addition, agonist competition curves indicated a significant increase in senescent atrial and a decrease in senescent ventricular tissue in the affinity of agonist for high-affinity A(1) receptors with no difference in dissociation constant (K(i)). No significant age-related differences in atrial or ventricular tissues occurred in either the antagonist affinity (K(d)) or density (B(max)) of the beta-adrenergic receptors. CPA was found to inhibit ISO-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity more in senescent than in adult atrial and ventricular membrane preparations.

AC activity is increased by at least 7-fold in heart membranes from transgenic animals and is stimulated by Ca(2+) in the same range of concentration that inhibits the endogenous activity.

A method was recently presented which reduces the influence of such noise by performing spatial and temporal alignment of VCG loops. The alignment is performed in terms of scaling, rotation and time synchronization of the loops. Using an ECG simulation model based on propagation of action potentials in cardiac tissue, the ability of the method to separate morphologic variability of physiological origin from respiratory activity was studied. Morphologic variability was created by introducing a random variation in action potential propagation between different compartments. The results indicate that the separation of these two activities can be done accurately at low to moderate noise levels (less than 10 microV). At high noise levels, the estimation of the rotation angles was found to break down in an abrupt manner. It was also shown that the breakdown noise level is strongly dependent on loop morphology; a planar loop corresponds to a lower breakdown noise level than does a nonplanar loop.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2000-04-14", "authors": ["MAstr\u00f6m", "ECarro Santos", "LS\u00f6rnmo", "PLaguna", "BWohlfart"], "doi": "10.1109/10.828149"}

Morphologically, stretched EHTs exhibited improved organization of cardiac myocytes into parallel arrays of rod-shaped cells, increased cell length and width, longer myofilaments, and increased mitochondrial density. Thus, stretch induced phenotypic changes, generally referred to as hypertrophy. Concomitantly, force of contraction was two- to fourfold higher both under basal conditions and after stimulation with calcium or the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Contraction kinetics were accelerated with a 14-44% decrease in twitch duration under all those conditions. In summary, we have developed a new in vitro model that allows morphological, molecular, and functional consequences of stretch to be studied under defined conditions. The main finding was that stretch of EHTs induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, which was accompanied by marked improvement of contractile function.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2000-04-01", "authors": ["CFink", "SErg\u00fcn", "DKralisch", "URemmers", "JWeil", "TEschenhagen"], "doi": "10.1096/fasebj.14.5.669"}

Several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and structurally similar compounds have been found to strongly inhibit the formation of TTR amyloid fibrils in vitro. These include flufenamic acid, diclofenac, flurbiprofen, and resveratrol. Crystal structures of the protein-drug complexes have been determined to allow detailed analyses of the protein-drug interactions that stabilize the native tetrameric conformation of TTR and inhibit the formation of amyloidogenic TTR. Using a structure-based drug design approach ortho-trifluormethylphenyl anthranilic acid and N-(meta-trifluoromethylphenyl) phenoxazine 4, 6-dicarboxylic acid have been discovered to be very potent and specific TTR fibril formation inhibitors.

In the present study equilibrium binding parameters of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) labelled by the specific radioligand [3H]PK 11195, were evaluated in cardiac tissue of rats submitted to 6 or 12 h noise exposure and of rats treated \"in vivo\" with PBR ligands such as PK 11195, Ro54864, diazepam and then noise-exposed. Results revealed a statistically significant decrease in the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of [3H]PK 11195 in atrial membranes of 6 or 12 h noise exposed rats, compared with sham-exposed animals, without any change in the dissociation constant (Kd). The \"in vivo\" PBR ligand pre-treatment counteracted the noise-induced modifications of PBR density. As PBRs are mainly located on mitochondria we also investigated whether noise exposure can affect the [3H]PK 11195 binding parameters in isolated cardiac mitochondrial fractions. Results indicated a significant Bmax value decrease in right atrial mitochondrial fractions of rats 6 or 12 h noise-exposed. Furthermore, as PBR has been suggested to be a supramolecular complex that might coincide with the not-yet-established structure of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-pore, the status of the MPT-pore in isolated heart mitochondria was investigated in noise- and sham-exposed rats. The loss of absorbance associated with the calcium-induced MPT-pore opening was greater in mitochondria isolated from hearts of 6 h noise- than those of sham-exposed rats. In conclusion, these findings represent a further instance for PBR density decrease in response to a stressful stimulus, like noise; in addition they revealed that \"in vivo\" administration of PBR ligands significantly prevents this decrease. Finally, our data also suggest the involvement of MPT in the response of an organism to noise stress.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2000-03-29", "authors": ["FSalvetti", "BChelli", "MGesi", "APellegrini", "GGiannaccini", "ALucacchini", "CMartini"], "doi": "10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00422-7"}

However, the time-dependent relationship between the levels of myocardial interstitial adenosine and tissue oxygenation has not yet been completely established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the complex relationship between tissue myocardial oxygen tension (PtiO(2)) and interstitial myocardial adenosine and lactate concentrations by developing a new technique which combines a cardiac microdialysis probe and a Clark-type P O(2)electrode. The combined and the single microdialysis probes were implanted in the left ventricular myocardium of anesthetized pigs. The consequences of the combined use of microdialysis and P O(2)probes on myocardial PtiO(2)and microdialysis performances against glucose were evaluated. A moderate but significant reduction in the relative recovery against glucose of the combined probe was observed when compared to that of the single microdialysis probe (42+/-2 v 32+/-1%, mean+/-S.E. M.n=5 P<0.05), at 2microl/min microdialysis probe perfusion flow. Similarly, myocardial oxygen enrichment, measured by the P O(2)electrode, was negligible when microdialysis probe perfusion flow was 2microl/min. Systemic hypoxia (FiO(2)=0.08) resulted in a significant decrease in PtiO(2)from 30+/-4 to 11+/-2 mmHg, limited increase in coronary blood flow (CBF), and a significant increase in myocardial adenosine and lactate concentrations from 0.34+/-0.05 to 0.98+/-0.06micromol/l and from 0.45+/-0.05 to 0.97+/-0.06 mmol/l respectively (P<0.05). Increasing the FiO(2)to 0.3 restored the PtiO(2)and hemodynamic parameters to baseline values with no changes in interstitial adenosine and lactate concentrations. Nevertheless, myocardial interstitial adenosine remained significantly higher than baseline values. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the ability of a combined probe to measure simultaneously regional myocardial PtiO(2)and metabolite concentration during hypoxia.

Among these compounds, a nitroderivative of aspirin (NCX 4016), which displays antiplatelet and vasodilating activities, appears to have clinical potential in cardiac pathology related to coronary insufficiency.\nIn this study the beneficial effects of NCX 4016 and aspirin were evaluated in vitro in a model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion of the rabbit and in vivo in a model of acute myocardial infarction of the same animal species.\nThe NCX 4016 (from 1 x 10(-5) M to 3 x 10(-4) M) caused dose-dependent cardiac protection in isolated rabbit hearts subjected to low flow ischemia-reperfusion. Inhibition of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PGF1alpha) generation and proportional reduction of creatine kinase (CK) activity at reperfusion was observed. Aspirin (1 x 10(-4)M) markedly worsened the post-ischemic ventricular dysfunction and this event was paralleled by a 63% increase in CK activity and abolition of 6-keto-PGF1alpha formation. Perfusion of the hearts with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (1 x 10(-5) M) worsened the ischemia-reperfusion damage in perfused hearts. This event was prevented by prior treatment with NCX 4016 (1 x 10(-4) M) but not with aspirin (1 x 10(-4) M). Ligation of the first antero-lateral branch of the left coronary artery in rabbits resulted in acute myocardial infarction with a mortality rate of 60% at 24 hours. NCX 4016 (0.5 mg/kg/min for 2 hours) significantly reduced the mortality rate by 10%, protected the rabbits against electrocardiogram derangement and almost abolished CK activity in plasma and myeloperoxidase activity in cardiac tissue.

{"title": "Morphologic and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis.", "abstract": "Apoptosis is characterised by a series of typical morphological features, such as shrinkage of the cell, fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies and rapid phagocytosis by neighbouring cells. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis as they relate to the morphologic hallmarks and their implications for the detection of apoptosis in cardiac tissue. Activation of cysteine proteases called caspases plays a major role in the execution of apoptosis. These proteases selectively cleave vital cellular substrates, which results in apoptotic morphology and internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA by selectively activated DNases. In response to several pro-apoptotic signals, mitochondria release caspase activating factors, that initiate an escalating caspase cascade and commit the cell to die. Members of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein family control mitochondrial events and are able to prevent, or induce, both apoptotic and non-apoptotic types of cell death. This suggests that different types of cell death share common mechanisms in the early phases, whereas activation of caspases determines the phenotype of cell death. Detection of apoptotic cells in tissue samples currently relies on the TUNEL assay. TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes show morphological features of apoptosis and the typical ladder pattern in DNA electrophoresis. Thus, provided that the staining protocol is carefully standardised, this quantitative methodology provides reproducible results of the occurrence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in cardiac samples. Recently, potentially more specific assays based on analysis of DNA fragmentation or demonstration of caspase activation have been developed. Applicability of these assays to demonstrate cardiomyocyte apoptosis should be tested.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2000-03-23", "authors": ["ASaraste", "KPulkki"], "doi": "10.1016/s0008-6363(99)00384-3"}

We now show in transfected cells, primary human endothelial cells, and human hearts, that eNOS with aspartate, but not glutamate, at position 298 is cleaved, resulting in the generation of 100-kDa and 35-kDa products. Recombinant or native eNOS was examined by immunoblotting either in lysates (COS7) or after partial purification over 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose. Immunoblotting after SDS/PAGE with a carboxyl-terminal antibody showed a single major protein band in the predicted position for eNOS at 135 kDa. An additional band at approximately 100 kDa was present only in the recombinant 298Asp eNOS and in the eNOS synthesized by primary cells and heart tissue with a G/T genotype. Using an eNOS amino-terminal-specific antibody, an immunoreactive band at approximately 35 kDa, corresponding to the residual N-terminal cleavage fragment, was observed in those cells with a T genotype. Thus, eNOS with aspartate but not glutamate at position 298 is cleaved, resulting in the generation of N-terminal 35-kDa and C-terminal 100-kDa fragments.

Z-(R)-1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-y (R)-alpha-hydroxy-alpha-(1-iodo-1-propen-3-yl)-alpha-phenylacetate (Z-(R,R)-IQNP) has demonstrated significant uptake in cerebral regions that contain a high concentration of m2 mAChR subtype in addition to heart tissue.

A blocking study demonstrated cerebral and cardiac levels of activity were significantly reduced by pretreatment (2-3 mg/kg) of (R)-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, dexetimide and scopolamine, established muscarinic antagonists. A direct comparison of the cerebral and cardiac uptake of [I-125]-Z-(R,R)-IQNP and [I-131]-E-(R,R)-IQNP (high uptake in ml, m4 rich mAChR cerebral regions) demonstrated Z-(R,R)-IQNP localized to a higher degree in cerebral and cardiac regions containing a high concentration of the m2 mAChR subtype as directly compared to E-(R,R)-IQNP.

Uniform-field shocks with variable strength [shock strength (SS) = 2-50 V/cm] were applied across strands during the action potential (AP) plateau, and DeltaV(m) were measured optically. Three different types of DeltaV(m) were observed. Small DeltaV(m) [<40%AP amplitude (APA)] were linearly dependent on SS and SW and were symmetrically distributed about a strand centerline with maximal positive and negative DeltaV(m) on opposite strand sides being equal. Intermediate DeltaV(m) (<200%APA) were strongly asymmetric with negative DeltaV(m) > positive DeltaV(m) because of a negative time-dependent shift of V(m) at the depolarized side of the strands. For large DeltaV(m) (>200%APA), a second time-dependent shift of V(m) to more positive levels was observed in the hyperpolarized portions of strands, causing reduction of the DeltaV(m) asymmetry.

Three inward voltage-activated currents were also identified. First, a rapidly activating and inactivating, sodium current (INa), blocked by tetrodotoxin, inactivated at holding potentials more positive than -40 mV, and abolished when external sodium was replaced by choline. Second, an L-type calcium current (ICa,L) with a sustained time course, suppressed by nifedipine or Co2+, and enhanced by substituting Ca2+ for Ba2+ in the external medium.

Addition of Noggin to explants isolated at stage 4 and cultured for 24 h resulted in loss of NKX2.5, GATA4, eHAND, Mef2A and vMHC expression. At stages 5-8 the individual genes showed differential sensitivity to Noggin addition. While expression of eHAND, NKX2.5 and Mef2A was clearly reduced by Noggin vMHC was only marginally affected. In contrast, GATA4 expression was enhanced after Noggin treatment. The developmental period during which cardiac mesoderm required the presence of BMP signaling in vivo was assessed by implantation of Noggin expressing cells into stage 4-8 embryos which were then cultured until stage 10-11. Complete loss of NKX2.5 and eHAND expression was observed in embryos implanted at stages 4-6, and expression was still suppressed in stages 7 and 8 implanted embryos.

NKX2.5 was induced by 6 h and accumulated over 48 h. vMHC and titin were induced at significant levels only after 48 h of BMP2 addition.

The microenvironmental properties of titanium dioxide ceramics helped to maintain the tissue-like structural organisation of the cardiac cells in vitro. Coating of the cell substrata with fine-grained titanium dioxide ceramics imitating cell surface topography favoured the formation of focal adhesion complexes in the ventral plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes. It also promoted the cellular expression of vinculin, a protein that connects the ECM integrin receptors to the network of cytoplasmic filaments, which define cell shape.

EHTs showed typical features of neonatal rat heart: a positive force-length and a negative force-frequency relation, high sensitivity to calcium (EC(50) 0.24 mM), modest positive inotropic (increase in TA by 46%) and pronounced positive lusitropic effect of isoprenaline (decrease in twitch duration by 21%). Both effects of isoprenaline were sensitive to the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of beta-galactosidase into EHTs reached 100% efficiency. In summary, EHTs retain many of the physiological characteristics of rat cardiac tissue and allow efficient gene transfer with subsequent force measurement.", "journal": "Biotechnology and bioengineering", "date": "2000-03-04", "authors": ["W HZimmermann", "CFink", "DKralisch", "URemmers", "JWeil", "TEschenhagen"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Non-cardiac nucleic acid composition and protein synthesis rates in hypertension: studies on the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model.", "abstract": "Various studies have shown the involvement of extracardiac tissues in hypertension, including the hepato-intestinal tract, musculo-skeletal system, skin, and the kidney. It was our hypothesis that these perturbations in non-cardiac tissues would also include alterations in protein metabolism. Thus, the reported differences in soleus contractile protein composition may be related to changes in muscle protein synthesis or reduced protein synthetic efficiencies. The aim of the present study was to characterise tissue composition of nucleic acids and rates of protein synthesis in non-cardiac tissues, such as liver, skeletal muscle (i.e., the Type I fibre-predominant soleus and Type II fibre-predominant plantaris), kidney, bone (tibia), skin and the gastrointestinal tract in a genetic model of hypertension (i.e., spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), 15 weeks old) compared to their genetic aged-matched counterparts, i.e., normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Rates of protein synthesis were measured in vivo after injection with a flooding dose of L-[4-(3)H]phenylalanine. The results showed changed tissue wet weights (g per organ) for plantaris (+10%, P<0.05), liver (+25%, P<0.01), brain (-9%, P<0.01), jejunum (+39%, P<0.001) and tibia (+17%, P<0.001) in SHRs compared to WKY controls. Protein content (g or mg per organ) was increased in the liver (+32%, P<0. 01) and tibia (+37%, P<0.05). RNA contents (mg per organ) were increased in plantaris (+17%, P<0.01), liver (+22%, P<0.01) and jejunum (+11%, P<0.05). DNA (mg per organ) was increased in plantaris (+16%, P<0.025) and jejunum (+12%, P<0.025). The protein synthetic capacities (i.e., C(s), mg RNA/g protein) were higher in soleus (+41%, P<0.01) and plantaris (+6%, P<0.05) muscles of SHRs compared to WKYs, whereas values were lower in liver (-11%, P<0.01) and kidney (-6%, P<0.01) of SHRs compared to WKYs. The fractional rate of protein synthesis (i.e., k(s), the percentage of the protein pool renewed each day) was not significantly different for any of the tissues, though the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA (i.e., k(RNA), mg protein/day per mg RNA) was reduced in the soleus (-24%, P<0.05) and the synthesis rate per unit DNA, i.e., k(DNA) (mg protein/day per mg DNA) was increased in the tibia (+31%, P<0.025).

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional activator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is critical for initiating early cellular responses to hypoxia. We investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the alpha subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha) and VEGF in specimens of human heart tissue to elucidate the early molecular responses to myocardial hypoxia.\nVentricular-biopsy specimens from 37 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were collected. The specimens were examined by microscopy for evidence of ischemia, evolving infarction, or a normal histologic appearance. The specimens were also analyzed with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for HIF-1alpha and VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and by immunohistochemical analysis for the location of the HIF-1alpha and VEGF proteins.\nHIF-1alpha mRNA was detected in myocardial specimens with pathological evidence of acute ischemia (onset, <48 hours before surgery) or early infarction (onset, <24 hours before surgery). In contrast, VEGF transcripts were seen in specimens with evidence of acute ischemia or evolving infarction (onset, 24 to 120 hours before surgery). Patients with normal ventricles or evidence of infarction in the distant past had no detectable levels of either VEGF mRNA or HIF-1alpha mRNA. HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity was detected in the nuclei of myocytes and endothelial cells, whereas VEGF immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining capillaries and arterioles.\nAn increase in the level of HIF-1alpha is an early response to myocardial ischemia or infarction. This response defines, at a molecular level, one of the first adaptations of human myocardium to a deprivation of blood.

The present experiment was designed to determine whether ONOO(-) may exert different effects on postischemic myocardial injury in a crystalloid perfusion environment versus a blood perfusion environment and, if it does, to clarify the mechanisms causing any differences. In Krebs-Henseleit buffer-perfused rabbit hearts, administration of ONOO(-) at the onset of reperfusion enhanced myocardial injury in a concentration-dependent fashion with a significant effective concentration of 30 microM. In contrast, in blood-perfused hearts, administration of ONOO(-) (1 to 30 microM) significantly attenuated postmyocardial injury as evidenced by improved cardiac function recovery, preserved endothelial function, decreased myocardial creatine kinase loss, and reduced necrotic size. The minimal and maximal protective concentrations were determined to be 1 and 3 microM, respectively. When a high concentration of ONOO(-) (i.e., 100 microM) was administered, a detrimental effect was observed. Administration of ONOO(-) decreased neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic-reperfused myocardial tissue in a concentration-dependent manner in blood-perfused hearts and inhibited neutrophil adhesion to cultured endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ONOO(-) may act as a \"double-edged sword\" in postischemic myocardial injury.

{"title": "Protective effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide on guinea-pig cardiac anaphylaxis.", "abstract": "Anaphylactic events occurring in cardiac tissues can result in cardiac dysfunction via vasoconstriction and arrhythmias. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is the most potent vasodilator and possesses anti-arrhythmic action. We examined the influence of CGRP on cardiac anaphylaxis in guinea-pigs. In the Langendorff-perfused heart of passively sensitized guinea-pigs, antigen challenge evoked a decrease in coronary flow, left ventricular pressure and its maximum first derivatives (+/-dP/dtmax) and an increased heart rate. Antigen challenge also induced atrioventricular conduction block. Treatment with CGRP (1 or 3 nM) significantly improved the recovery of cardiac function and reduced the incidence and duration of atrioventricular block without influencing the increased heart rate. Pretreatment with capsaicin caused effects similar to those of CGRP and markedly elevated the content of CGRP in coronary effluent. Ischaemic preconditioning, induced by two cycles each of 5 min global ischaemia and 5 min reperfusion, also improved cardiac function and raised the level of CGRP in coronary effluent. The protective effects of ischaemic preconditioning were abolished in the presence of the CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP8-37. Histamine release did not differ significantly during any of the interventions. The findings of the present study indicate that, in guinea-pig hearts, CGRP protects against cardiac anaphylaxis and that the cardioprotection by CGRP is independent of histamine release.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2000-02-24", "authors": ["WDai", "F WZhou", "Q JSong", "Y JLi", "H WDeng", "X MXiong"], "doi": "10.1007/s002109900171"}

In the present study, we show that IgM antimyosin antibodies do not induce myocarditis; however, these same antibodies become pathogenic when converted to the IgG isotype. Although IgM antibodies can penetrate the myocardium during cardiac inflammation, they are usually less able to leave the vascular compartment and penetrate cardiac tissue, thus accounting for their lack of pathogenicity.

As an index of external heart work, aortic flow was measured. Heart rate, coronary flow, and developed pressure were recorded. At the end of heart perfusion, mitochondria were isolated and analyzed for adenosine triphosphatase activity, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and membrane fluidity. Moreover, intact mitochondria and lipid peroxidation were investigated using a model system.\nCompared to controls, reproterol gave the most favorable results, with an increase of 25 to 30% of aortic flow during reoxygenation at a concentration of 10 micromol/g heart tissue. In contrast, both fenoterol and salbutamol at a concentration of 1 micromol/g heart tissue decreased aortic flow during reoxygenation, whereas terbutaline had a negative influence on aortic flow at 0.01 to 0.1 micromol/g heart tissue. Mitochondria of these hearts were isolated at the end of the experiment. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis was increased above controls at nearly all concentrations of reproterol. ATP synthesis was decreased at 1 micromol and 10 micromol fenoterol. As little as 0.0005 micromol terbutaline decreased ATP synthesis by 50%. In intact mitochondria, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to oxygen ratios were found to be increased with terbutaline and fenoterol, indicating ADP consumption by myokinase activation. Lipid peroxidation was increased in a model system between concentrations of 0.002 micromol/mg and 0.04 micromol/mg phosphatidylcholine by fenoterol and terbutaline, whereas a decrease was noted with reproterol. Membrane fluidity was found increased after addition of reproterol, which supports the evidence of efficient ATP synthesis by this compound.\nCardiodepressive side effects and greater toxicity of fenoterol and terbutaline were found under the conditions of our experiment.

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of increased cardiac bilirubin in protection against postischemic myocardial dysfunction. Rat hearts were isolated and perfused according to the Langendorff technique to evaluate the recovery of myocardial function after 30 min of global ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. We found that upregulation of the inducible isoform of heme oxygenase (HO-1) by treatment of animals with hemin 24 h before ischemia ameliorated myocardial function and reduced infarct size (tetrazolium staining) on reperfusion of isolated hearts. Tin protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase activity, completely abolished the improved postischemic myocardial performance observed after hemin-mediated HO-1 induction. Likewise, cardiac tissue injury was exacerbated by treatment with tin protoporphyrin IX. Increased cardiac HO-1 expression and heme oxygenase activity were associated with enhanced tissue bilirubin content and an increased rate of bilirubin release into the perfusion buffer. Furthermore, exogenously administered bilirubin at concentrations as low as 100 nanomolar significantly restored myocardial function and minimized both infarct size and mitochondrial damage on reperfusion.

Addition of either isoproterenol or a cocktail to raise intracellular cAMP increased the whole cell currents of NMCM. The cAMP-dependent conductance was largely anionic, as determined under asymmetrical (low intracellular) Cl(-) conditions and symmetrical Cl(-) in the presence of various counterions, including Na(+), Mg(2+), Cs(+), and N-methyl-D-glucamine. Furthermore, the cAMP-stimulated conductance was also permeable to ATP. The cAMP-activated currents were inhibited by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, glibenclamide, and an anti-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) monoclonal antibody. The anti-CFTR monoclonal antibody failed, however, to inhibit an osmotically activated anion conductance, indicating that CFTR is not linked to osmotically stimulated currents in this cell model. Immunodetection studies of both neonatal mouse heart tissue and cultured NMCM revealed that CFTR is expressed in these preparations. The implication of CFTR in the cAMP-stimulated Cl(-)- and ATP-permeable conductance was further verified with NMCM of CFTR knockout mice [cftr(-/-)] in which cAMP stimulation was without effect on the whole cell currents. In addition, stimulation with protein kinase A and ATP induced Cl(-)-permeable single-channel activity in excised, inside-out patches from control, but not cftr(-/-) NMCM. The data in this report indicate that cAMP stimulation of NMCM activates an anion-permeable conductance with functional properties similar to those expected for CFTR, thus suggesting that CFTR may be responsible for the cAMP-activated conductance. CFTR may thus contribute to the permeation and/or regulation of Cl(-)- and ATP-permeable pathways in the developing heart.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Nineteen patients with CHF underwent cardiac transplantation or partial ventriculectomy, which provided the heart tissue.

Moderate to severe fibrosing myocarditis characterized the hearts of the chagasic patients. In cardiomyopathies not associated with Chagas' disease, the inflammation was discrete, if present, but the amount of fibrosis was similar to that found in Chagas' cardiomyopathy. Reduction of both kinds of nerve terminals occurred in the heart of all patients. The parasympathetic denervation was proven to be more severe in chagasic cardiomyopathy.

{"title": "Electrophysiological effects of fluoxetine in mammalian cardiac tissues.", "abstract": "Fluoxetine is a widely used antidepressant compound having selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor properties. In this study, the actions of fluoxetine were analyzed in guinea pig, rat, rabbit and canine ventricular myocardiac preparations using conventional microelectrode and whole cell voltage clamp techniques. Low concentrations of fluoxetine (1-10 micromol/l) caused significant shortening of action potential duration (APD) and depression of the plateau potential in guinea pig and rabbit papillary muscles and single canine ventricular myocytes. In rat papillary muscle, APD was not affected by fluoxetine (up to 100 micromol/l), however, the drug decreased the force of contraction with EC50 of 10 micromol/l. Fluoxetine (10 micromol/l) also decreased the maximum velocity of depolarization and action potential overshoot in each species studied. At this concentration no effect was observed on the resting membrane potential; high concentration (100 micromol/l), however, caused depolarization. In voltage clamped canine ventricular myocytes, fluoxetine caused concentration-dependent block of the peak Ca2+ current at 0 mV with EC50 of 5.4+/-0.94 micromol/l and Hill coefficient of 1.1+/-0.14 (n=6). In addition, 10 micromol/l fluoxetine shifted the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve of the Ca2+ current from -20.7+/-0.65 to -26.7+/-1 mV (P<0.001, n=8) without changing its slope factor. These effects of fluoxetine developed rapidly and were fully reversible. Fluoxetine did not alter voltage-dependence of activation or time constant for inactivation of I(Ca). Fluoxetine had no effect on the amplitude of K+ currents (I(K1) and I(to)). The inhibition of cardiac Ca2+ and Na+ channels by fluoxetine may explain most cardiac side effects observed occasionally with the drug. Our results suggest that fluoxetine may have antiarrhythmic (class I + IV type), as well as proarrhythmic properties (due to impairment of atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction and shortening of repolarization). Therefore, in depressed patients with cardiac disorders, ECG control may be suggested during fluoxetine therapy.", "journal": "Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology", "date": "2000-01-29", "authors": ["PPacher", "JMagyar", "PSzigligeti", "TB\u00e1ny\u00e1sz", "CPankucsi", "ZKorom", "ZUngv\u00e1ri", "VKecskem\u00e9ti", "P PN\u00e1n\u00e1si"], "doi": "10.1007/s002109900154"}

However, the optimal defibrillation waveshape with respect to delivered energy remains unknown. To this end, this study has derived the theoretically optimal waveshapes for monophasic and biphasic defibrillation shocks as predicted from a lumped-component model of cardiac tissue in conjunction with the \"charge-banking\" and \"charge-burping\" hypotheses of defibrillation. These derivations predict that a truncated ascending exponential waveshape--with a shock time constant, tau s, always equal to the underlying tissue time constant, tau m--minimizes the delivered energy required for defibrillation. These predictions are qualitatively consistent with available experimental data. Thus, to the extent that \"charge-banking\" and \"charge-burping\" are assumed to be valid and accurate models of defibrillation, these derivations identify the theoretical \"gold standards\" of defibrillation waveshapes requiring minimum delivered energy.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2000-01-26", "authors": ["M GFishler"], "doi": "10.1109/10.817620"}

We hypothesized that cardiac tissue from hypoxia-tolerant animals might have high levels of specific HSPs. We measured myocardial HSP60 and HSP72/73 in painted and softshell turtles during normoxia and anoxia (12 h) and after recovery (12 or 24 h). We also measured myocardial HSPs in normoxic rats and rabbits. During normoxia, hearts from the most highly anoxia-tolerant species, the painted turtle, expressed the highest levels of HSP60 (22.6+/-2.0 mg/g total protein) followed by softshells (11.5+/-0.8 mg/g), rabbits (6.8+/-0.9 mg/g), and rats (4.5+/-0.5 mg/g). HSP72/73 levels, however, were not significantly different. HSP60 levels in hearts from both painted and softshell turtles did not deviate significantly from control values after either 12 h of anoxia or 12 or 24 h of recovery. The pattern of changes observed in HSP72/73 was quite different in the two turtle species. In painted turtles anoxia induced a significant increase in myocardial HSP72/73 (from 2.8+/-0.1 mg/g normoxic to 3.9+/-0.2 mg/g anoxic, P<0.05). By 12 h of recovery, HSP72/73 had returned to control levels (2.7+/-0.1 mg/g) and remained there through 24 h (2.6+/-0.2 mg/g). In softshell turtles, HSP72/73 decreased significantly after 12 h of anoxia (from 2.4+/-0.4 mg/g normoxic to 1.3+/-0.2 mg/g anoxic, P<0.05). HSP72/73 levels were still slightly below control after 12 h of recovery (2.1+/-0.1 mg/g) and then rose to significantly above control after 24 h of recovery (4.1+/-0.7 mg/g, P<0.05).

{"title": "The extracellular matrix is an important source of ultrasound backscatter from myocardium.", "abstract": "Ultrasound tissue characterization with measurement of backscatter has been employed in numerous experimental and clinical studies of cardiac pathology, yet the cellular components responsible for scattering from cardiac tissues have not been unequivocally identified. This laboratory has proposed a mathematical model for myocardial backscatter that postulates the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) as a significant determinant of backscatter. To demonstrate the importance of ECM, this group sought to determine whether measurements of backscatter from the isolated ECM could reproduce the known directional dependence, or anisotropy of backscatter, from intact cardiac tissues in vitro. Segments of left ventricular free wall from ten formalin fixed porcine hearts were insonified at 50 MHz, traversing the heart wall from endo- to epicardium to measure the anisotropy of myocardial backscatter, defined as the difference between peak (perpendicular to fibers) and trough (parallel to fibers) backscatter amplitude. The tissue segments were then treated with 10% NaOH to dissolve all of the cellular components, leaving only the intact ECM. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained of tissue sections to reveal complete digestion of the cellular elements. The dimensions of the residual voids resulting from cell digestion were approximately the diameter of the intact myocytes (10-30 microm). These samples were reinsonified after seven days of treatment to compare the anisotropy of integrated backscatter. The magnitude of anisotropy of backscatter changed from 15.4 +/- 0.8 to 12.6 +/- 1.1dB for intact as compared with digested specimens. Because digestion of the myocardium leaves only extracellular sources of ultrasonic scattering, and because the isolated ECM exhibits similar ultrasonic anisotropy as does the intact myocardium, it is concluded that there is a direct association between the ECM and the anisotropy of backscatter within intact tissue. Thus, it is suggested that ultrasonic tissue characterization represents a potentially clinically applicable method for delineating the structure and function of the ECM.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2000-01-21", "authors": ["C SHall", "M JScott", "G MLanza", "J GMiller", "S AWickline"], "doi": "10.1121/1.428327"}
{"title": "Effects of the T-type Ca(2+) channel blocker mibefradil on repolarization of guinea pig, rabbit, dog, monkey, and human cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "At supratherapeutic doses (2- to 5-fold), the T-type Ca(2+) antagonist mibefradil modifies the T/U wave of the human ECG. In this study, we show that this effect is observed in conscious monkeys and is duplicated by verapamil or diltiazem. We then evaluate the proarrhythmic risk of such alterations of cardiac repolarization by examining the actions of mibefradil on cardiac action potentials (APs). In isolated cardiomyocytes from guinea pigs or humans, mibefradil dose dependently shortens the plateau of the AP; this effect is similar to other Ca(2+) antagonists and opposite to drugs having class III antiarrhythmic properties. The metabolites of mibefradil, singly or in combination, also shorten APs. In isolated rabbit hearts, noncardiodepressant concentrations of mibefradil have no effect on monophasic action potentials (MAPs), whereas cardiodepressant levels produce a slight nonsignificant lengthening. In hearts of open-chest bradycardic dogs, mibefradil has no effect on MAP dispersion or on QT interval and shortens MAPs slightly; although high doses produce atrioventricular block, likely through Ca(2+) antagonism, arrhythmias are never observed. In contrast, d-sotalol lengthens QT interval and MAPs, increases dispersion, and produces arrhythmias. Together, these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that mibefradil carries no proarrhythmic risk despite changes in T/U wave morphology. Although these changes resemble those observed with class III compounds, they also are seen with nonproarrhythmic compounds such as verapamil and diltiazem. In conclusion, the classical models used in the present study could not link the changes in T/U wave morphology produced by mibefradil and verapamil to any experimental marker of proarrhythmic liability.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2000-01-20", "authors": ["AB\u00e9nardeau", "JWeissenburger", "LHondeghem", "E AErtel"], "doi": null}

A second group of 15 rhesus macaques chronically infected with pathogenic (n=6) or nonpathogenic (n=9) virus were studied at >2 years following infection. Cardiac tissues from 24 rhesus macaques chronically infected (>2 years) with pathogenic SIV were reviewed for evidence of cardiac pathology. Acute infection (<6 weeks) with either pathogenic or nonpathogenic SIV caused neither contractile dysfunction nor cardiac pathology. However, LV ejection fraction was significantly (P<0.05) depressed (43+/-7%) in rhesus macaques chronically infected with pathogenic SIV compared with rhesus macaques chronically infected with nonpathogenic SIV (61+/-3%). Furthermore, two thirds of rhesus macaques that succumbed to simian AIDS had myocardial pathology including lymphocytic myocarditis (n=9) and coronary arteriopathy (n=6), with complete vessel occlusion (n=4) and associated myocardial infarction and necrosis.\nThis unique model is valuable in understanding the pathogenesis of cardiac injury associated with retroviral infection in a relevant nonhuman primate model of AIDS.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2000-01-19", "authors": ["R PShannon", "M ASimon", "M AMathier", "Y JGeng", "SMankad", "A ALackner"], "doi": "10.1161/01.cir.101.2.185"}

The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the ventricular myocardium of adult male rats expressed mRNAs for T- and low-molecular-weight (L-) kininogens, tissue kallikreins such as true kallikrein and T-kininogenase, and bradykinin B2 receptor, but not those for high-molecular-weight kininogen and B1 receptor.

Tail arterial blood pressure, urinary excretion of NO metabolites (ie, nitrate and nitrite), and immunodetectable NOS isotype proteins in the vascular, renal, cardiac, and cerebral tissues were measured. The placebo-treated SHR group showed a marked elevation of blood pressure and a significant upregulation of aorta, kidney, and cardiac tissue endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS, respectively) proteins and of brain and renal tissue neuronal NOS. Lazaroid therapy ameliorated hypertension and mitigated the upregulation of eNOS and iNOS in vascular, renal, and cardiac tissues but had limited effect on the expression of renal and brain neuronal NOS. In contrast, lazaroid therapy had no effect on blood pressure, urinary nitrate and nitrite excretion, or tissue NOS isotype expressions in the Wistar-Kyoto group.

{"title": "Micronutrients and host resistance to viral infection.", "abstract": "Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that a virus could undergo rapid mutation in a host deficient in Se, leading to a normally avirulent virus acquiring virulence due to genome changes. Once these mutations occur, even a host with adequate Se-nutriture is susceptible to the newly virulent virus. What influence does the deficiency in Se have on the immune response of the host? Infection with myocarditic strains of coxsackievirus induces an inflammatory response in the cardiac tissue. It is this immune response that induces the heart damage, rather than direct viral effects on the heart tissue. Chemokines are chemo-attractant molecules that are secreted during an infection in order to attract immune cells to the site of the injury, and have been found to be important for the development of coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. We found that a deficiency in Se influences the expression of mRNA for the chemokine monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, which may have implications for the development of myocarditis in the Se-deficient host. Expression of mRNA for interferon-gamma was also greatly decreased in the Se-deficient animal. Thus, a deficiency in Se can have profound effects on the host as well as on the virus itself. How the alteration of the immune response of the Se-deficient animal affects the development of the virulent genotype remains to be answered.", "journal": "The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society", "date": "2000-01-11", "authors": ["M ABeck", "C CMatthews"], "doi": "10.1017/s0029665100000823"}

Autopsy revealed a pericardial effusion, a mixed lymphocytic and neutrophilic myocarditis, a mild lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, focal bronchial/bronchiolar mucosal necrosis, and histologic changes consistent with asthma. Infection with influenza A (H3N2) was confirmed by virus isolation from a postmortem nasopharyngeal swab. Attempts to isolate virus from heart and lung tissue were unsuccessful. Immunohistochemical tests directed against influenza A antigens and in situ hybridization for influenza A genetic material demonstrated positive staining in bronchial epithelial cells, whereas heart sections were negative. Sudden death is a rare complication of influenza and may be caused by myocarditis. Forensic pathologists should be aware that postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs for viral culture and immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization procedures on lung tissue might be necessary to achieve a diagnosis.

This modulation may be critical for the regulation of tissue metabolism. Several physiological processes act in concert to make endothelial NO synthase-derived NO potentially important in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in cardiac tissue, including (1) the nature of the capillary network in the myocardium, (2) the diffusion distance for NO, (3) the low toxicity of NO at physiological (nanomolar) concentrations, (4) the fact that low PO(2) in tissue facilitates the action of NO on cytochrome oxidase, and (5) the formation of oxygen free radicals. A decrease in NO production is involved in the pathophysiological modifications that occur in heart failure and diabetes, disease states associated with altered cardiac metabolism that contributes to the evolution of the disease process. In contrast, several drugs (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, amlodipine, and statins) can restore or maintain endogenous production of NO by endothelial cells, and this mechanism may explain part of their therapeutic efficiency.

Addition of PLC to ADR-incubated myocytes induced 79% reversal of ADR-induced inhibition of palmitate oxidation. In isolated rat heart mitochondria, ADR produced concentration-dependent inhibition of both palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-carnitine oxidation, while PLC caused a more than 2.5-fold increase in both substrates. Preincubation of mitochondria with 5 mM PLC caused complete reversal of ADR-induced inhibition in the oxidation of both substrates. Also ADR induced concentration-dependent inhibition of CPT I which is parallel to the inhibition of its substrate palmitoyl-CoA. In rat heart slices, ADR induced a significant (65%) decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and this effect is reduced to 17% only by PLC.
