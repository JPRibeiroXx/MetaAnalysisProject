{"title": "Effects of Topical Kiwifruit on Healing of Chronic Bedsore.", "abstract": "Kiwifruit (Actindia deliciosa) is demonstrated to have antibacterial and pro-angiogenic effect. Moreover, this fruit contains proteolytic enzymes (actinidin) and ascorbic acid. Considering these properties and based on the results of recent animal studies, we carried out this study to evaluate the effects of kiwifruit on bedsore in clinical settings. Forty patients with stage 2-3 sacral bedsores, preferably paraplegic, quadriplegic, and/or hemiplegic, were allocated into two groups of experiment and control. Under local anesthesia and sedation, ulcers of the experiment and control groups were dressed with pure extract of kiwifruit and normal saline, respectively, on a daily basis for 21\u00a0days. The ulcers were examined and photographed weekly. Pre- and postintervention biopsies were taken from the ulcers to perform microbiological and histological study. Mean reduction in surface area of bedsore in the experiment group was significantly higher than the control group (486.47 vs. 117.38\u00a0mm, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The amount of collagen and granulation tissue were significantly higher in experiment groups than the control group (p value 0.005 and 0.02, respectively). Significantly higher levels of angiogenesis and vascularization were found in the kiwifruit-treated patients (p\u2009<\u20090.02). In addition, obvious antibacterial effect was observed in the kiwifruit group. Natural compounds in the kiwifruit, including protein-dissolving enzymes (actinidin) and antibacterial agents, improve different aspects of the wound healing process. Based on its benefits and safety, we conclude that using kiwifruit is a simple, applicable, and effective way for treatment of bedsore.", "journal": "The Indian journal of surgery", "date": "2016-01-06", "authors": ["GholamrezaMohajeri", "MasoumehSafaee", "Mohamad HosseinSanei"], "doi": "10.1007/s12262-013-0869-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03550.x\n10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.11.003\n10.1016/j.jcrc.2009.09.002\n10.1038/sc.2009.32\n10.1159/000111381\n10.1016/S0002-9610(03)00285-X\n10.1016/S0378-8741(02)00195-2\n10.1016/j.surg.2010.02.013\n10.1016/S0924-8579(97)00376-2\n10.1016/S0305-4179(99)00117-5\n10.1016/j.burns.2006.10.384\n10.1016/j.cger.2011.02.001\n10.1016/j.burns.2009.04.021\n10.1016/j.otohns.2004.06.289\n10.1104/pp.111.187989\n10.1016/S0378-8741(02)00125-3\n10.1016/j.tips.2006.04.006"}
{"title": "Biliary tract anatomy and its relationship with venous drainage.", "abstract": "Portal cavernoma develops as a bunch of hepatopetal collaterals in response to portomesenteric venous obstruction and induces morphological changes in the biliary ducts, referred to as portal cavernoma cholangiopathy. This article briefly reviews the available literature on the vascular supply of the biliary tract in the light of biliary changes induced by portal cavernoma. Literature pertaining to venous drainage of the biliary tract is scanty whereas more attention was focused on the arterial supply probably because of its significant surgical implications in liver transplantation and development of ischemic changes and strictures in the bile duct due to vasculobiliary injuries. Since the general pattern of arterial supply and venous drainage of the bile ducts is quite similar, the arterial supply of the biliary tract is also reviewed. Fine branches from the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal, retroportal, gastroduodenal, hepatic and cystic arteries form two plexuses to supply the bile ducts. The paracholedochal plexus, as right and left marginal arteries, run along the margins of the bile duct and the reticular epicholedochal plexus lie on the surface. The retropancreatic, hilar and intrahepatic parts of biliary tract has copious supply, but the supraduodenal bile duct has the poorest vascularization and hence susceptible to ischemic changes. Two venous plexuses drain the biliary tract. A fine reticular epicholedochal venous plexus on the wall of the bile duct drains into the paracholedochal venous plexus (also called as marginal veins or parabiliary venous system) which in turn is connected to the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein, gastrocolic trunk, right gastric vein, superior mesenteric vein inferiorly and intrahepatic portal vein branches superiorly. These pericholedochal venous plexuses constitute the porto-portal collaterals and dilate in portomesenteric venous obstruction forming the portal cavernoma.", "journal": "Journal of clinical and experimental hepatology", "date": "2015-03-11", "authors": ["Chittapuram SRamesh Babu", "MalaySharma"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jceh.2013.05.002"}

We describe here an innovative use of the ischiorectal fat pad to aid in the repair of acquired rectovaginal and rectourethral fistulae.\nPatients with recurrent vaginal or urethral fistulae were selected for review. The ischiorectal fat pad was deliberately mobilized (via a posterior sagittal or transanal approach) and used to buttress the repair of the posterior vagina or urethra.\nThe ischiorectal fat pad technique was used in 9 patients. All had an acquired fistula (6 rectovaginal fistula, 3 rectourethral fistulas). We used the posterior sagittal approach in 7 and in 2 the transanal approach. Six patients had had at least two prior attempts at fistula repair. Six patients had a stoma, and 3 did not. There were no recurrences in greater than six month follow-up.\nThe ischiorectal fat pad is easily visualized and mobilized, either via a posterior sagittal or transanal approach, providing excellent coverage with native, well-vascularized tissue, in an area that is difficult to heal.

Bone scan is indicted in the evaluation of frostbite injuries and helps to establish the prognosis early.\na 42 year old man suffered frostbite injury in the fingers and toes after more than 24 hours at 8,000 meters of altitude. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy and topical cures for six weeks. During this period, we performed two consecutive bone scan studies showing no changes in the level of vascularization. However, clinical improvement was important, devitalized tissues delimited to the level marked by the bone scan study, so amputation was performed.\nBecause the bone scan remained invariable, we believe that could help us to determine the amputation level early without delaying surgery.\nAntecedentes: la congelaci\u00f3n es el da\u00f1o sufrido por los tejidos cuando se someten a temperaturas inferiores a su punto de congelaci\u00f3n.

{"title": "Epicutaneous Immunotherapy for Aeroallergen and Food Allergy.", "abstract": "IgE-mediated allergies today affect up to 30\u00a0% of the population in industrialized countries. Allergen immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying treatment option with a long-term effect. However, very few patients (<5\u00a0%) choose immunotherapy, due to the long treatment duration (between 3-5\u00a0years) and possible local and systemic allergic side effects of the allergen administrations. The latter occur when an allergen accidentally reaches the blood circulation. Therefore, the ideal application route for allergen immunotherapy should be characterized by two hallmarks: firstly, by a high number of potent antigen-presenting cells, which enhance efficacy and thus shorten treatment duration. Secondly, the allergen administration site is ideally non-vascularized, so that inadvertent systemic distribution of the allergen and consequent systemic allergic side effects are minimized. The epidermis contains high numbers of potent antigen-presenting Langerhans cells and, as an epithelium, is non-vascularized. Therefore, the epidermis represents an interesting administration route. Historical evidence for the clinical efficacy of epicutaneous allergy immunotherapy (EPIT) has now been strengthened by a number of recent double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trials performed by independent groups.

This micronutrient deficiency impacts collagen formation and results in damage to a variety of bodily tissues. While clinical manifestations are observed routinely, the lack of specific signatures on bone makes paleopathological diagnosis difficult. Rapid growth in infants, children, and subadults provides abundant remodeled tissue and an increase in vascularization that makes identification possible in younger segments of the population. However, diagnosis of scurvy in adults remains problematic, given that diagnostic lesions are strikingly similar to those associated with rickets, osteomalacia, and other conditions. We argue that this confounding factor underscores the need for a broader anthropological approach to scurvy research that expands beyond differential diagnosis to include more accurate reconstruction of diets and available resources, greater consideration of the possibility - even likelihood - of multiple nutrient deficiencies simultaneously affecting an individual, and the patterning of these deficiencies along lines of status, sex, and age.", "journal": "International journal of paleopathology", "date": "2014-06-01", "authors": ["George JArmelagos", "KendraSirak", "TaylorWerkema", "Bethany LTurner"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpp.2013.09.007"}

Mast cells are best known for their effector functions during anaphylaxis and acute IgE-associated allergic reactions, but they also have been implicated in a wide variety of processes that maintain health or contribute to disease. There has been particular interest in the possible roles of mast cells in tumor biology. In vitro studies have shown that mast cells have the potential to influence many aspects of tumor biology, including tumor development, tumor-induced angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling, and the shaping of adaptive immune responses to tumors. Yet, the actual contributions of mast cells to tumor biology in vivo remain controversial. Here, we review some basic features of mast cell biology with a special emphasis on those relevant to their potential roles in tumors. We discuss how using in vivo tumor models in combination with models in which mast cell function can be modulated has implicated mast cells in the regulation of host responses to tumors.

Zygomycetes impinge into the vascular network, resulting in thrombosis and necrosis of the surrounding hard and soft tissues. The infection begins in the nose and paranasal sinuses due to inhalation of fungal spores and spread to orbital and intracranial structures either by direct invasion or through the blood vessels. Sinus mucormycosis is often accompanied by a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. Hence, aggressive surgical intervention with antifungal therapy is usually necessary. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can reduce the mortality and morbidity of this lethal fungal infection.

{"title": "Design and evaluation of a transesophageal HIFU probe for ultrasound-guided cardiac ablation: simulation of a HIFU mini-maze procedure and preliminary ex vivo trials.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. Left atrial catheter ablation is currently performed to treat this disease. Several energy sources are used, such as radio-frequency or cryotherapy. The main target of this procedure is to isolate the pulmonary veins. However, significant complications caused by the invasive procedure are described, such as stroke, tamponade, and atrioesophageal fistula, and a second intervention is often needed to avoid atrial fibrillation recurrence. For these reasons, a minimally-invasive device allowing performance of more complex treatments is still needed. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can cause deep tissue lesions without damaging intervening tissues. Left atrial ultrasound-guided transesophageal HIFU ablation could have the potential to become a new ablation technique. The goal of this study was to design and test a minimally-invasive ultrasound-guided transesophageal HIFU probe under realistic treatment conditions. First, numerical simulations were conducted to determine the probe geometry, and to validate the feasibility of performing an AF treatment using a HIFU mini-maze (HIFUMM) procedure. Then, a prototype was manufactured and characterized. The 18-mm-diameter probe head housing contained a 3-MHz spherical truncated HIFU transducer divided into 8 rings, with a 5-MHz commercial transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) transducer integrated in the center. Finally, ex vivo experiments were performed to test the impact of the esophagus layer between the probe and the tissue to treat, and also the influence of the lungs and the vascularization on lesion formation. First results show that this prototype successfully created ex vivo transmural myocardial lesions under ultrasound guidance, while preserving intervening tissues (such as the esophagus). Ultrasound-guided transesophageal HIFU can be a good candidate for treatment of AF in the future.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2014-03-25", "authors": ["ElodieConstanciel", "W ApoutouN'Djin", "FrancisBessi\u00e8re", "Fran\u00e7oiseChavrier", "DanielGrinberg", "AlexandreVignot", "PhilippeChevalier", "Jean YvesChapelon", "CyrilLafon"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2772"}

While rates of obesity, specific types of cancer and cardiovascular disorders seem to be on the rise in this group, many new therapies have addressed diseases that have been largely untreatable in the past. Alzheimer's disease has also recently come to the forefront of ongoing maladies most typically associated with an aging population. Ironically, though, many people seem to be living longer than expected. Recent biochemical, nutritional and genomic approaches have been able to elucidate some of the complex mechanisms, which lead to chronic diseases associated with an aging population such as Alzheimer's, metabolic syndrome, tumor metastasis and cardiovascular disease. These diseases and their sequalae seem to be related in many respects, with the common culprit being the inflammatory environment created by the presence of excess fat - particularly within the vascular network. Although a substantial effort has been focused on the development of new-line therapeutics to address these issues, nutrition and overall fitness and their effects on stalling or potentially reversing the advent of these diseases has not been fully embraced in the research arena.

One of the most potent pro-angiogenic agents is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which, from a basic science and pre-clinical perspective, seems ideal for the therapeutic stimulation of blood vessel growth in non-healing wounds.\nCurrent strategies to improve the dysfunctional angiogenesis that occurs in non-healing wounds are inadequate with regard to the nature and magnitude of the clinical problem. However, VEGF therapy has so far been unsuccessful in promoting healing in the clinic. More effective means of delivery to the wound, which take into account the biochemical and spatio-temporal aspects of angiogenesis, may be necessary to realize VEGF's therapeutic potential. Reviewed approaches for the regulation of wound angiogenesis include: targeting regulators of intracellular VEGF signaling, making use of collagen-binding VEGF fusion proteins for increased retention in the wound, and implantation of heterogeneous scaffold systems for spatial control of angiogenesis with simultaneous use of VEGF and its inhibitor.\nTo maximize efficacy of therapeutic VEGF, it may be necessary to also target its intracellular inhibitory mechanisms.

Advanced planning is required as posterior septectomy during transsphenoidal surgery can preclude its use due to destruction of the vascular pedicle. We present four cases in which the HBF was successfully used to repair recurrent CSF leaks despite prior posterior septectomy and transsphenoidal surgery. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who developed recurrent CSF leak after transsphenoidal surgery over a 7-year period (2006-2013). Data were collected regarding demographics, clinical presentation, intraoperative findings, and surgical outcomes. Four patients who developed recurrent CSF drainage after transsphenoidal surgery were managed with HBF reconstruction during the study period. Two were men and two were women with a mean age of 37 years (range, 24-48 years). All had previously undergone resection of a pituitary macroadenoma via a transsphenoidal approach, with intraoperative CSF leaks repaired using multilayered free grafts. Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea arose 0.37-12 months (mean, 2.98 months) after the initial pituitary surgery. Active CSF drainage could be visualized intraoperatively with posterior septal perforations present. The HBF was successfully used in all cases, with no evidence of recurrent CSF leak after a mean follow-up of 2.35 years. The HBF may be salvaged for repair of recurrent CSF leaks even in the context of prior posterior septectomy and transsphenoidal surgery.

Thirty SD rats, with a defect of skull in every rat, were divided into the CBB and pure cuttlefish bone (PCB) groups according to the random number table, with 15 rats in each group. The rats in the group CBB and group PCB were transplanted with the corresponding material to repair the skull defect. At post transplantation week (PTW) 4, 6, and 8, 5 rats from every group were sacrificed by exsanguination, and ink perfusion was performed. One day later, all the transplants and part of the skull surrounding the defect were harvested, and general observation was conducted at the same time. The specimens were paraffin sectioned for HE staining and Masson staining. The area of microvessel and the area of newborn bone were observed and analyzed through histopathological techniques and image collection system. Data were processed with the analysis of variance of factorial design and LSD test. The correlation between the area of microvessel and the area of newborn bone of the group CBB was analyzed with Pearson correlation analysis.\n(1) The general observation of the transplant region showed that the transplants were encapsulated by a capsule of fibrous connective tissue. The texture of capsule was soft and relatively thick at PTW 4. The texture was tenacious and thin, but rather compact at PTW 6 and 8. The transplants became gelatinous at PTW 4, and similar to the cartilage tissue at PTW 6 and 8. (2) Histological observation showed that the structure of the transplants in two groups was damaged at PTW 4. A moderate quantity of inflammatory cell infiltration could be observed. The amounts of the primary bone trabeculae and microvessels in group CBB were more abundant than those of group PCB, while the number of osteoclasts was less than those of group PCB. At PTW 6, the inflammatory cell infiltration in the transplants in both groups decreased obviously, the cuttlefish bone was found to be further degraded, and the number of newborn microvessels was increased. There were mature bone trabeculae around the transplants in both groups. And there were also mature bone trabeculae in the degraded CBB in group CBB. At PTW 8, the inflammatory reaction in the transplants in both groups disappeared; there were more mature bone trabeculae; the structure of the cuttlefish bone was found to be damaged basically. Bone trabeculae in group PCB were found around the transplant, while the bone trabeculae could be observed not only around the transplant but also in the degraded CBB in group CBB. The amount of the microvessels in group CBB was still larger than that of group PCB. (3) From PTW 4 to 8, the area of microvessel in group CBB [(63 \u00b1 4), ( 136 \u00b1 36), ( 347 \u00b1 31) \u00b5m(2)] was larger than that in group PCB [(44 \u00b1 7), (73 \u00b1 4), (268 \u00b1 42) \u00b5m(2), P < 0.05 or P < 0.01].

Laser microporous porcine ADM (LPADM) was produced by laser punching, hypertonic saline solution acellular method, and crosslinking treatment, and nonporous porcine ADM (NPADM) was produced by the latter two procedures. Then the appearance observation, histological examination and scanning electron microscope observation were conducted. BMMCs were isolated and cultured from tibia and femur after sacrifice of an SD rat. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation experiments were conducted among the adherent cells in the third passage. Then they were inoculated to LPADM and NPADM to construct BMMCs-LPADM and BMMCs-NPADM materials. Twenty-one healthy nude mice were divided into BMMCs-LPADM+NPADM group (A, n = 6), LPADM+split-thickness skin graft group (B, n = 6), BMMCs-LPADM+split-thickness skin graft group (C, n = 6), BMMCs-NPADM+split-thickness skin graft group (D, n= 3) according to randomized block. After anesthesia, a 2 cm\u00d72 cm full-thickness skin defect reaching deep fascia was reproduced in the middle of the back of each nude mouse, and a split-thickness skin graft of the same size was obtained, and then prepared skin grafts were transplanted to cover the wounds respectively. On post transplantation day (PTD) 5, 7, and 14, local condition and adverse effects observation was conducted; one nude mouse was sacrificed each time to harvest all the transplant for tissue structure observation with HE staining. On PTD 7 and 14, neonatal skin appendages in corresponding composite materials were observed with transmission electron microscope.\n(1) LPADM and NPADM appeared to be porcelain white, soft, and flexible. No cellular component was observed in acellular dermal matrix. Scanning electron microscope showed that the collagen fibers were orderly arranged. LPADM had microporous structure. (2) Cells in the third passage were orderly arranged with the shape similar to fibroblasts with high growth speed. (3) Induced differentiation experiments showed that cells could differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. (4) On PTD 5, the NPADM in group A was dry in part; skin grafts in group D were dry and necrotic, and there was no infection and inflammation in groups A and D; skin grafts in groups B and C survived. On PTD 7 and 14, the overlaying material in group A was black, dry, and hard in part; the skin grafts in group D turned to be completely black, dry, and necrotic, and pale yellow clear exudate was found in subcutaneous area; there was no obvious purulent discharge in groups A and D; the appearance of skin grafts in groups B and C was close to the surrounding skin. (5) On PTD 5 and 7, in groups A, B, and C, vascularization was apparent in the pores of dermal matrix, and red blood cells could be found. In group D, skin grafts were dry and necrotic. On PTD 14, in groups A, B, and C, the pore structure of dermal matrix was fully vascularized in which a large number of red blood cells were visible. In group A, the microporous dermal matrix survived, but the overlaying NPADM was not attached closely. In groups B and C, the skin grafts were closely connected to the dermal matrix, and no cutaneous appendages were observed. In group C, special monolayer cells were found at the junction between skin graft and dermal matrix. (6) Skin grafts in group D failed to survive; they were not observed with the electron microscope.

Being highly biocompatible and similar to native extracellular matrix, hydrogels have emerged as ideal candidates in the design of 3D scaffolds for tissue regeneration and drug delivery applications. However, precise control over hydrogel properties, such as porosity, pore size, and pore interconnectivity, remains a challenge. Traditional techniques for creating conventional crosslinked polymers have demonstrated limited success in the formation of hydrogels with large pore size, thus limiting cellular infiltration, tissue ingrowth, vascularization, and matrix mineralization (in the case of bone) of tissue-engineered constructs.

Peripheral vascular disease is present in the majority of patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Despite standard treatments there exists a high amputation rate. Circulating angiogenic cells previously known as early endothelial progenitor cells are derived from peripheral blood and support angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, providing a potential topical treatment for non-healing diabetic foot ulcers.\nA scaffold fabricated from Type 1 collagen facilitates topical cell delivery to a diabetic wound. Osteopontin is a matricellular protein involved in wound healing and increases the angiogenic potential of circulating angiogenic cells. A collagen scaffold seeded with circulating angiogenic cells was developed. Subsequently the effect of autologous circulating angiogenic cells that were seeded in a collagen scaffold and topically delivered to a hyperglycemic cutaneous wound was assessed. The alloxan-induced diabetic rabbit ear ulcer model was used to determine healing in response to the following treatments: collagen seeded with autologous circulating angiogenic cells exposed to osteopontin, collagen seeded with autologous circulating angiogenic cells, collagen alone and untreated wound. Stereology was used to assess angiogenesis in wounds.\nThe cells exposed to osteopontin and seeded on collagen increased percentage wound closure as compared to other groups. Increased angiogenesis was observed with the treatment of collagen and collagen seeded with circulating angiogenic cells.\nThese results demonstrate that topical treatment of full thickness cutaneous ulcers with autologous circulating angiogenic cells increases wound healing.

Design We retrospectively analyzed five patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal resection of TSM and performed a comprehensive review of articles published between 2000 and 2012 describing the operative treatment of TSMs. Results Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in four patients (80%). Transient diabetes insipidus occurred in three patients (60%). Preoperative visual field deficit resolved in all patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in one patient. Analysis of published studies included 1,026 transcranial and 144 transnasal cases. GTR was achieved in 85% of transcranial and 72% of transnasal cases. Visual field deficit improved in 65% of transcranial and 82% of transnasal cases. Rate of diabetes insipidus and CSF leak was higher in the transnasal series. Rate of GTR and visual improvement was higher in endoscopic endonasal as compared with microsurgical transnasal series. Conclusion The literature supports transsphenoidal surgery for the resection of TSMs with significant optic nerve compromise and limited lateral extension.

Because the lumbar spine carries significant forces and disks don't have a dedicated blood supply, end plates must balance conflicting requirements of being strong to prevent vertebral fracture and porous to facilitate transport between disk cells and vertebral capillaries. Consequently, end plates are particularly susceptible to damage, which can increase communication between proinflammatory disk constituents and vascularized vertebral bone marrow. Damaged end plate regions can be sites of reactive bone marrow lesions that include proliferating nerves, which are susceptible to chemical sensitization and mechanical stimulation. Although several lines of evidence indicate that innervated end plate damage can be a source of chronic low back pain, its role in patients is likely underappreciated because innervated damage is poorly visualized with diagnostic imaging. This literature review summarizes end plate biophysical function and aspects of pathologic degeneration that can lead to vertebrogenic pain. Areas of future research are identified in the context of unmet clinical needs for patients with chronic low back pain.", "journal": "Global spine journal", "date": "2014-01-18", "authors": ["J CLotz", "A JFields", "E CLiebenberg"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0033-1347298"}
{"title": "Proximal scaphoid arthroplasty using the medial femoral trochlea flap.", "abstract": "Background The medial trochlea of the femur (medial femoral trochlea, MFT) provides a source of convex osteocartilaginous vascularized bone that has been demonstrated to have a similar contour to the proximal scaphoid. This provides a potential solution for difficult recalcitrant proximal pole scaphoid nonunions. Materials and Methods Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent MFT proximal scaphoid arthroplasty were reviewed. Follow-up data were recorded at a minimum of 6 months, with an average of 14 months. The results of this cohort were previously reported in detail but are summarized herein. Description of Technique The ability to reconstruct both bone and cartilage of the nonunion enables the surgeon to resect the nonunited proximal pole to prepare for scaphoid reconstruction. A segment of osteocartilaginous MFT is harvested in dimensions required by the scaphoid defect. The MFT segment is harvested on the transverse branch of the descending geniculate vessels. Fixation may be achieved with ease due to the size of the reconstructed segment. Results Computed tomography imaging demonstrated 15 of 16 reconstructed scaphoids achieving osseous union. Follow-up range of motion (ROM) of the wrist averaged 46.0\u00b0 extension (range 28-80\u00b0) and 43.8\u00b0 flexion (range 10-80\u00b0), which was similar to preoperative (average 45.7\u00b0 extension and 43.0\u00b0 flexion). Scapholunate angles remained unaffected (51.6\u00b0 preoperatively and 48.6\u00b0 postoperatively), indicating preservation of carpal relationships.

{"title": "Vascularized bone grafts for the treatment of carpal bone pathology.", "abstract": "Primary bone healing fails to occur in 5-15\u00a0% of scaphoid bones that undergo fracture fixation. Untreated, occult fractures result in nonunion up to 12\u00a0% of the time. Conventional bone grafting is the accepted management in the treatment algorithm of scaphoid nonunion if the proximal pole is vascularized. Osteonecrosis of the proximal scaphoid pole intuitively suggests a need for transfer of the vascularized bone to the nonunion site. Scaphoid nonunion treatment aims to prevent biological and mechanical subsidence of the involved bone, destabilization of the carpus, and early degenerative changes associated with scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse. Pedicled distal radius and free vascularized bone grafts (VBGs) offer hand surgeons an alternative treatment option in the management of carpal bone nonunion. VBGs are also indicated in the treatment of avascular necrosis of the scaphoid (Preiser's disease), lunate (Kienb\u00f6ck's disease), and capitate. Relative contraindications to pedicled dorsal radius vascularized bone grafting include humpback deformity, carpal instability, or collapse. The free medial femoral condyle bone graft has offered a novel treatment option for the humpback deformity to restore geometry of the carpus, otherwise not provided by pedicled grafts. In general, VBGs are contraindicated in the setting of a carpal bone without an intact cartilaginous shell, in advanced carpal collapse with degenerative changes, and in attempts to salvage small or collapsed bone fragments. Wrist salvage procedures are generally accepted as the more definitive treatment option under such circumstances.

Focal surgery allows the preservation of fertility, endocrine function and integrity of the genital anatomy, with preservation of the image of the male body. The EAU guidelines suggest focal surgery in case of synchronous bilateral tumors, metachronous contralateral tumours, tumour in solitary testis with normal pre-operative testosterone levels, when the tumor volume less than 30% of the testicular volume. There are two focal surgical techniques: tumorectomy and polar resection, followed by biopsies and frozen section of the resection bed. In case of benign tumours, the treatment is often curative. In case of malignancy, carcinoma in situ is frequently found in the surrounding tissues. Adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy is performed with a fair success rate. These adjuvant treatments reduce or delete the functional benefits achieved by conservative surgery. The evidence of the literature suggests that focal surgery is a valid option for all patients with testicular tumours that are not palpable and small sized, with the advantage of avoiding unnecessary radical orchiectomy in most cases. Therefore, the selection criteria for focal surgery are the mass size (less than 25 mm) and a safety distance of the tumor from the rete testis, in order to preserve testicular vascularization.

The retinal vessels were segmented using computer-assisted software, and non-vessel fragments were deleted. The fractal dimension was measured based on the log\u2013log plot of the number of grids versus the size. The retinal vascular DF was analyzed to determine changes with increasing age. Finally, the data were fitted to three polynomial models. All three models are statistically significant (Linear: R(2) = 0.1270, 213 d.f., p < 0.001, Quadratic: R(2) = 0.1536, 212 d.f., p < 0.001, Cubic: R(2) = 0.1529, 211 d.f., p < 0.001). The quadratic regression is significantly better than the linear regression (p < 0.001); however, the increase in R(2) from the quadratic model to the cubic model is not significant (p = 0.97).

{"title": "Imaging of solitary pulmonary nodule-a clinical review.", "abstract": "Current widespread use of cross-sectional imaging has led to exponential rise in detection of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). Whilst large numbers of these are benign 'incidentalomas', lung cancers presenting as SPNs are often early disease, which have good prognosis. Therefore, there is rising demand and expectation for more accurate, non-invasive, diagnostic tests to characterize SPNs, aiming to avoid missed or delayed diagnosis of lung cancer. There are wide differential diagnoses of benign and malignant lesions that manifest as SPNs. On conventional imaging, the morphological features supporting benignity include stable small nodule size, smooth demarcated margins, and calcifications. Lack of significant contrast enhancement is also more suggestive of benign nodules. With improved understanding of tumor biology, for instance neo-vascularization and increased vascular permeability, imaging techniques such as dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) provide details on contrast uptake and wash-out kinetics, which is more closely reflecting the physiological and pathological phenomena. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18fluorine-fluoro-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) is a well-established functional imaging technique, for which one of the most common indications is differentiating between benign and malignant SPNs. Combined PET-CT integrates the anatomical, morphological and metabolic aspects in a single examination, improving overall diagnostic accuracy. Semi-quantitative analysis in FDG-PET imaging is based on measurement of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax).

{"title": "Quantification of subcortical gray-matter vascularization using 7 Tesla time-of-flight angiography.", "abstract": "Background The integrity of subcortical brain nuclei is associated with maintenance of regular cognitive performance levels and has been shown to be particularly affected by aging-related vascular pathology. This study aims to demonstrate applicability of high field strength magnetic resonance angiography at 7 Tesla (7T) for assessment of interindividual variation in subcortical vascularization. Methods Two healthy female subjects without known history of cerebrovascular disease or malformation, aged 43 and 86 years, respectively, were administered three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography at 7T. The FreeSurfer software package was used for automated parcellation and assessment of subcortical volumes. For each volume, mean regional intensities were calculated based on the TOF contrast as a quantitative reflection of regional subcortical gray-matter vascularization. Results While volumes of the subcortical brain region assessed did not differ significantly (30.2 and 27.8 mL, P = 0.78), mean intensities were significantly reduced in the older participant (10%, P = 0.004). Mean intensities could be assessed for each participant for 14 subcortical structures, strongest differences were observable for the left and right Thalamus (T [left, right] = 3.85, 3.82; P [left, right] = 0.002, 0.003). Conclusions High-resolution TOF magnetic resonance angiography may be used in combination with automated volume-based parcellation to quantify regional subcortical vascularization and to assess interindividual differences.

Under this new paradigm for cellular crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment, the origin of endothelial cells and tumor cells may have a direct impact on the pathobiology of cancer. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of endothelial cell species (i.e. murine or human) on xenograft tumor growth and response to therapy. Tumor xenografts vascularized either with human or with murine microvascular endothelial cells were engineered, side-by-side, subcutaneously in the dorsum of immunodefficient mice. When tumors reached 200 mm(3), mice were treated for 30 days with either 4 mg/kg cisplatin (i.p.) every 5 days or with 40 mg/kg sunitinib (p.o.) daily. Xenograft human tumors vascularized with human endothelial cells grow faster than xenograft tumors vascularized with mouse endothelial cells (P<0.05). Notably, human tumors vascularized with human endothelial cells exhibited nuclear translocation of p65 (indicative of high NF-kB activity), and were more resistant to treatment with cisplatin or sunitinib than the contralateral tumors vascularized with murine endothelial cells (P<0.05).

IGF1 signaling through IGF type 1 receptor (IGF1R) controls cell proliferation, survival and differentiation in multiple cell types. IGF1 deficiency in mice disrupts lung morphogenesis, causing altered prenatal pulmonary alveologenesis. Nevertheless, little is known about the cellular and molecular basis of IGF1 activity during lung development.\nPrenatal Igf1(-/-) mutant mice with a C57Bl/6J genetic background displayed severe disproportional lung hypoplasia, leading to lethal neonatal respiratory distress. Immuno-histological analysis of their lungs showed a thickened mesenchyme, alterations in extracellular matrix deposition, thinner smooth muscles and dilated blood vessels, which indicated immature and delayed distal pulmonary organogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of Igf1(-/-) E18.5 lungs using RNA microarrays identified deregulated genes related to vascularization, morphogenesis and cellular growth, and to MAP-kinase, Wnt and cell-adhesion pathways. Up-regulation of immunity-related genes was verified by an increase in inflammatory markers. Increased expression of Nfib and reduced expression of Klf2, Egr1 and Ctgf regulatory proteins as well as activation of ERK2 MAP-kinase were corroborated by Western blot. Among IGF-system genes only IGFBP2 revealed a reduction in mRNA expression in mutant lungs. Immuno-staining patterns for IGF1R and IGF2, similar in both genotypes, correlated to alterations found in specific cell compartments of Igf1(-/-) lungs. IGF1 addition to Igf1(-/-) embryonic lungs cultured ex vivo increased airway septa remodeling and distal epithelium maturation, processes accompanied by up-regulation of Nfib and Klf2 transcription factors and Cyr61 matricellular protein.\nWe demonstrated the functional tissue specific implication of IGF1 on fetal lung development in mice.

Here, we developed a 3D microfluidic model to analyze the specificity of human breast cancer metastases to bone, recreating a vascularized osteo-cell conditioned microenvironment with human osteo-differentiated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. The tri-culture system allowed us to study the transendothelial migration of highly metastatic breast cancer cells and to monitor their behavior within the bone-like matrix. Extravasation, quantified 24\u00a0h after cancer cell injection, was significantly higher in the osteo-cell conditioned microenvironment compared to collagen gel-only matrices (77.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7% vs. 37.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3%), and the migration distance was also significantly greater (50.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2\u00a0\u03bcm vs. 31.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0\u03bcm).

FACS purification resulted in 100% Flk1(+) VE-cadherin(+) cells from both mES and miPS cells.

{"title": "miR-126 functions as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma by targeting Sox2.", "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and young adults, the early symptoms and signs of which are non-specific. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides a new avenue for the early diagnosis and treatment of OS. miR-126 has been reported to be highly expressed in vascularized tissues, and is recently widely studied in cancers. Herein, we explored the expression and significance of miR-126 in OS. Using TaqMan RT-PCR analysis, we analyzed the expression of miR-126 in 32 paired OS tumor tissues and 4 OS cell lines and found that miR-126 was consistently under-expressed in OS tissues and cell lines compared with normal bone tissues and normal osteoblast cells (NHOst), respectively. As miR-126 is significantly decreased in OS tissues and cell lines, we sought to compensate for its loss through exogenous transfection into MG-63 cells with a miR-126 mimic. Ectopic expression of miR-126 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis of MG-63 cells. Moreover, bioinformatic prediction suggested that the sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2) is a target gene of miR-126. Using mRNA and protein expression analysis, luciferase assays and rescue assays, we demonstrate that restored expression of Sox2 dampened miR-126-mediated suppression of tumor progression, which suggests the important role of miR-126/Sox2 interaction in tumor progression.

The cumulative release kinetics were evaluated, and the effects of the released Rg1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) behavior, including proliferation, migration, tube formation, cell-cycle progression, cell apoptosis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, were investigated. Additionally, HUVECs were cultured on the CC-GMS scaffold to test its biocompatibility. Standard Rg1 and VEGF were used as positive controls.\nThe results indicated that the CC-GMS scaffold had good release kinetics. The Rg1 released from the CC-GMS scaffold did not lose its activity and had a significant effect on HUVEC proliferation. Both Rg1 and VEGF promoted HUVEC migration and tube formation.

Liver tissue engineering is a combination of various strategies that aim at generating functional liver tissue that can help restore and/or support the ailing liver as it recuperates. Conventionally, in vitro culture has involved growing cells in different media compositions or layering them on matrices largely composed of native ECM components such as collagen or Matrigel. With recent advances in technology, more sophisticated techniques are being devised that are better equipped to capture distinct features of the liver in an in vivo microenvironment. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of liver cells in 3D scaffolds, as spheroids or cell sheets, allow for a high degree of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction and an in vivo-like architecture. More recently, decellularized matrices have been used as scaffolds that support ideal cell-matrix interactions. Microfabrication technologies initially used to pattern semiconductors in the integrated circuit industry have grown out of this field and now encompass a variety of methods to etch patterns onto both 2D and 3D scaffolds to allow incorporation of custom-made features resembling the fluid network and organization in native liver.

{"title": "Markers of T cell infiltration and function associate with favorable outcome in vascularized high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.", "abstract": "When T cells infiltrate the tumor environment they encounter a myriad of metabolic stressors including hypoxia. Overcoming the limitations imposed by an inadequate tumor vasculature that contributes to these stressors may be a crucial step to immune cells mounting an effective anti-tumor response. We sought to determine whether the functional capacity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) could be influenced by the tumor vasculature and correlated this with survival in patients with ovarian cancer.\nIn 196 high-grade serous ovarian tumors, we confirmed that the tumor vascularity as measured by the marker CD31 was associated with improved patient disease-specific survival. We also found that tumors positive for markers of TIL (CD8, CD4 and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)) and T cell function (granzyme B and T-cell restricted intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1)) correlated significantly with elevated vascularity. In vitro, hypoxic CD8 T cells showed reduced cytolytic activity, secreted less effector cytokines and upregulated autophagy. Survival analysis revealed that patients had a significant improvement in disease-specific survival when FoxP3 expressing cells were present in CD31-high tumors compared to patients with FoxP3 expressing cells in CD31-low tumors [HR: 2.314 (95% CI 1.049-5.106); p = 0.0377]. Patients with high vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressing tumors containing granzyme B positive cells had improved survival compared to patients with granzyme B positive cells in VEGF-low tumors [HR: 2.522 (95% CI 1.097-5.799); p = 0.0294].\nOverall, this data provides a rationale for developing strategies aimed at improving the adaptability and function of TIL to hypoxic tumor conditions.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2014-01-01", "authors": ["Katelin NTownsend", "Jaeline ESpowart", "HassanHuwait", "SimaEshragh", "Nathan RWest", "Mary AElrick", "Steve EKalloger", "MichaelAnglesio", "Peter HWatson", "David GHuntsman", "Julian JLum"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0082406"}

Bone healing occurs despite periosteal stripping of the dorsal and medial surfaces of this widely articulated bone followed by osteotomy in the midsection of the bone. The objective of this study was to characterize the blood supply of the medial cuneiform.\nThirty matched pairs of adult cadaver legs, 60 legs total, were amputated below the knee, and arterial casts were created with India ink and latex. Soft tissues were debrided, allowing visualization of the extraosseous blood vessels. In 53 specimens the vascular supply to the medial cuneiform was photographed and recorded. Forty-nine specimens were then cleared using a modified Sp\u00e4lteholz technique. The intraosseous vascularity of the medial cuneiform was successfully characterized and reviewed in 48 of these specimens.\nThe extraosseous blood supply was similar to previous reports with a middle pedicle branch originating from the dorsalis pedis artery. The medial plantar and superficial medial plantar artery supplied the plantar aspect of the bone. Intraosseous analysis showed a dense capillary network throughout the cuneiform, with typically one central medial major and several minor nutrient arteries noted. Areas of hypovascularity were infrequent and when noted occurred at inconsistent locations.\nThese findings support the clinical suspicion that the medial cuneiform is well vascularized from multiple sources. The plantar blood supply is likely sufficient to allow bone healing after dorsal periosteal exposure and possible injury to the middle pedicle branch of the distal medial tarsal artery.\nA medial cuneiform opening wedge osteotomy can be used to correct forefoot deformity.

Here, we report that ADAM8 is abundantly expressed in breast tumors and derived metastases compared to normal tissue, especially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Furthermore, high ADAM8 levels predicted poor patient outcome. Consistently, ADAM8 promoted an aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in culture. In a mouse orthotopic model, tumors derived from TNBC cells with ADAM8 knockdown failed to grow beyond a palpable size and displayed poor vascularization. Circulating tumor cells and brain metastases were also significantly reduced. Mechanistically, ADAM8 stimulated both angiogenesis through release of VEGF-A and transendothelial cell migration via \u03b21-integrin activation. In vivo, treatment with an anti-ADAM8 antibody from the time of cell inoculation reduced primary tumor burden and metastases. Furthermore, antibody treatment of established tumors profoundly decreased metastases in a resection model.

The average age at onset of the first keratitis preceding surgery was 18 years (between 5 and 40 years). The indication for surgery in 9 cases was to improve vision and in 3 patient to prevent corneal perforation. Nine patients were given both acyclovir and mycophenolate mofetil, as anti-viral agent and immunosuppressive treatment, respectively. Two patients were treated with anti-viral agent only while one patient received no systemic therapy. The average follow-up time was 53.1 months (between 16 and 84 months).\nOf the 9 patients who underwent surgery for improving vision, 8 patients had transparent grafts during follow up without vascularization. All eight patients had been treated with acyclovir and mycophenolate mofetil. In one patient who had no systemic treatment recurrence and graft rejection was observed. Only one of the surgeries performed in acute stage of inflammation resulted in a properly healed transparent graft without recurrence and rejection. In this patient acyclivir and mycophenolate mofetil therapy had been given previously. In two cases the preventive - full or partial - systemic treatment had no effect. The visual acuity improved in all cases. In three patients visual acuity was influenced by some other factors as well.\nThe systemic acyclovir and mycophenolat mofetil therapy is fairly successful in perforating keratoplasty due to herpes simplex infection. Acyclovir decreases the risk of recurrence, while mycophenolate mofetil may prevent graft rejection. The timing of surgery is decisive; it leads to better results when performed in a scarred, noninflammatory state.\nBevezet\u00e9s: A herpes simplex v\u00edrus \u00e1ltal okozott szaruh\u00e1rtya-gyullad\u00e1s a leggyakoribb oka a cornea centrum\u00e1ban kialakul\u00f3 hegnek, amely l\u00e1t\u00e1sveszt\u00e9st okozhat.

We used volumetric computerized tomography to measure functional parenchymal volume before and after partial nephrectomy in the operated kidney.

{"title": "[Prevention of diabetic foot].", "abstract": "Diabetic foot (DF) is the most common chronic complication, which depends mostly on the duration and successful treatment of diabetes mellitus. Based on epidemiological studies, it is estimated that 25% of persons with diabetes mellitus (PwDM) will develop the problems with DF during lifetime, while 5% do 15% will be treated for foot or leg amputation. The treatment is prolonged and expensive, while the results are uncertain. The changes in DF are influenced by different factors usually connected with the duration and regulation of diabetes mellitus. The first problems with DF are the result of misbalance between nutritional, defensive and reparatory mechanisms on the one hand and the intensity of damaging factors against DF on the other hand. Diabetes mellitus is a state of chronic hyperglycemia, consisting of changes in carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism. As a consequence of the long duration of diabetes mellitus, late complications can develop. Foot is in its structure very complex, combined with many large and small bones connected with ligaments, directed by many small and large muscles, interconnected with many small and large blood vessels and nerves. Every of these structures can be changed by nutritional, defensive and reparatory mechanisms with consequential DE Primary prevention of DF includes all measures involved in appropriate maintenance of nutrition, defense and reparatory mechanisms.First, it is necessary to identify the high-risk population for DF, in particular for macrovascular, microvascular and neural complications. The high-risk population of PwDM should be identified during regular examination and appropriate education should be performed. In this group, it is necessary to include more frequent and intensified empowerment for lifestyle changes, appropriate diet, regular exercise (including frequent breaks for short exercise during sedentary work), regular self control of body weight, quit smoking, and appropriate treatment of glycemia, lipid disorders (treatment with fenofibrate reduces the incidence of DF amputations (EBM-Ib/A), hypertension, hyperuricemia, neuropathy, and angiopathy (surgical reconstructive bypass) or endovascular (percutaneous transluminar angioplasty). In the low-risk group of PwDM, no particular results can be achieved, in contrast to the high-risk groups of PwDM where patient and professional education has shown significant achievement (EBM-IV/C). In secondary prevention of DF, it is necessary to perform patient and professional education how to avoid most of external influences for DE Patient education should include all topics from primary prevention, danger of neural analgesia (no cooling or warming the foot), careful selection of shoes, daily observation of foot, early detection all foot changes or small wounds, daily hygiene of foot skin, which has to be clean and moist, regular self measurements of skin temperature between the two feet (EBM-Ib/A), prevention of self treatment of foot deformities, changing wrong habits (walking footless), medical consultation for even small foot changes (EBM-Ib/A) and consultation by multidisciplinary team (EBM-IIb/B). Tertiary DF prevention includes ulcer treatment, prevention of amputation and level of amputation. In spite of the primary and secondary prevention measures, DF ulcers develop very often. Because of different etiologic reasons as well as different principles of treatment which are at the same time prevention of the level of amputation, the approach to PwDF has to be multidisciplinary. A high place in the treatment of DF ulcers, especially neuropathic ulcers, have the off-loading principles (EBM-Ib/A), even instead of surgical treatment (EBM-Ib/A). Necrectomy, taking samples for analysis from the deep of ulcer, together with x-ray diagnostics (in particular NMR), the size of the changes can be detected, together with appropriate antibiotic use and indication for major surgical treatment. The patient has to be instructed to the involved DF with off-loading (EBM-IIb/A). Negative pressure wound therapy can accelerate the closure of complex diabetic foot wounds (EBM- Ib/A). DF local treatment as well as ulcer covering for detritus absorption has not been EBM approved, although covering can diminish secondary infection. Skin or surrogate transplantations looks rationale but very expensive in comparison to off-loading. Randomized clinical trials do not prove usefulness of antibiotic treatment or surgical intervention in uninfected ulcer (EBM-IV/C), but the decision is left to the experienced physician. Evidence of osteomyelitis together with infected DF ulcer changes the prognosis of treatment, increasing the importance of antibiotic or surgical treatment (EBM-IIIB/B). Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen can help in wound healing, but without any influence on revascularization (EBM-Ib/A). At the end, the decision for the level of amputation has to be made. Charcot neuroarthropathy is still not clearly defined, so the randomized controlled trials are rare; thus, there are many new ways of treatment but the basics belongs to off-loading in simple changes through surgical treatment in more complex changes (EBM-IV/C)(rbn1). All available methods for detecting the level of vascularization, angioplasties, and oxymetry have to be used to decide on the minimal level of amputation.", "journal": "Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti", "date": "2014-01-01", "authors": ["ZeljkoMetelko", "NevaBrkljaci\u0107 Crkvenci\u0107"], "doi": null}

This study used both in vivo [Wistar rats treated with 1 mg/kg nicotine from 2 wk prior to mating until gestational day (GD) 15] and in vitro (RCHO-1 cell line; treated with 10(-9) to 10(-3)M nicotine) models to examine the effects of nicotine on these pathways. At GD 15, control and treated placentas were examined for the impact of nicotine on 1) trophoblast invasion, proliferation, and degree of hypoxia, 2) labyrinth vascularization, 3) expression of key genes of placental development, and 4) expression of placental angiogenic factors. The RCHO-1 cell line was used to determine the direct effects of nicotine on trophoblast differentiation. Our in vivo experiments show that nicotine inhibits trophoblast interstitial invasion, increases placental hypoxia, downregulates labyrinth vascularization as well as key transcription factors Hand1 and GCM1, and decreases local and circulating EG-VEGF, a key placental angiogenic factor. The in vitro experiments confirmed the inhibitory effects of nicotine on the trophoblast migration, invasion, and differentiation processes and demonstrated that those effects are most likely due to a dysregulation in the expression of nicotine receptors and a decrease in MMP9 activity. Taken together, these data suggest that adverse effects of maternal smoking on pregnancy outcome are due in part to direct and endocrine effects of nicotine on the main processes of placental development and establishment of FC.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Preludes to brain failure: executive dysfunction and gait disturbances.", "abstract": "The progressive and insidious gait and cognitive decline seen in older individuals without overt disease may result from a combination of age-dependent neuronal changes that are often exacerbated by vascular pathomechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that slow gait and executive dysfunction are early phenomena in this decline and may further evolve to the development of falls and dementia. These early manifestations can be seen as \"brain failure\" and their co-occurrence suggests that they may share a common underlying mechanism. The authors argue that brain cortical control of motor and gait performance; and high complex cognitive functions such as executive function, share the same brain networks. Due to its particular watershed vascularization, these brain networks are highly susceptible to microvascular damage and the effects of vascular risk factors. A unified approach for evaluating and treating these two features of aging will close the gap in our understanding of cognitive-motor interactions and ultimately alter the pathways to disability. Besides the standard treatment for cognitive and mobility decline, the authors suggest that treating reversible vascular risk factors and hypertension, especially when they represent early manifestations of brain damage, has the potential to be a complementary method to prevent loss of mobility and cognitive decline in older adults.", "journal": "Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology", "date": "2013-12-25", "authors": ["ManuelMontero-Odasso", "VladimirHachinski"], "doi": "10.1007/s10072-013-1613-4"}
{"title": "Urea-based osmoregulation in the developing embryo of oviparous cartilaginous fish (Callorhinchus milii): contribution of the extraembryonic yolk sac during the early developmental period.", "abstract": "Marine cartilaginous fish retain a high concentration of urea to maintain the plasma slightly hyperosmotic to the surrounding seawater. In adult fish, urea is produced by hepatic and extrahepatic ornithine urea cycles (OUCs). However, little is known about the urea retention mechanism in developing cartilaginous fish embryos. In order to address the question as to the mechanism of urea-based osmoregulation in developing embryos, the present study examined the gene expression profiles of OUC enzymes in oviparous holocephalan elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii) embryos. We found that the yolk sac membrane (YSM) makes an important contribution to the ureosmotic strategy of the early embryonic period. The expression of OUC enzyme genes was detectable in the embryonic body from at least stage 28, and increased markedly during development to hatching, which is most probably due to growth of the liver. During the early developmental period, however, the expression of OUC enzyme genes was not prominent in the embryonic body. Meanwhile, we found that the mRNA expression of OUC enzymes was detected in the extra-embryonic YSM; the mRNA expression of cmcpsIII in the YSM was much higher than that in the embryonic body during stages 28-31. Significant levels of enzyme activity and the existence of mitochondrial-type cmgs1 transcripts in the YSM supported the mRNA findings. We also found that the cmcpsIII transcript is localized in the vascularized inner layer of the YSM. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that the YSM is involved in urea-based osmoregulation during the early to mid phase of development in oviparous cartilaginous fish.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental biology", "date": "2013-12-24", "authors": ["WataruTakagi", "MakikoKajimura", "HironoriTanaka", "KumiHasegawa", "Justin DBell", "TesToop", "John ADonald", "SusumuHyodo"], "doi": "10.1242/jeb.094649"}

Its ovarian functions include anti-angiogenic actions. This study aimed to explore other PEDF-actions and the sites of PEDF expression in the human ovary.\nWe used paraffin-embedded human ovarian sections for PEDF-immunohistochemistry and IVF-derived human granulosa cells (GCs) for RT-PCR, Western blotting and functional studies, including measurement of cell viability (ATP-assay), apoptosis (caspase-assay) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).\nImmunohistochemistry revealed PEDF in the cytoplasm of GCs of avascular follicles from the preantral to the antral stage and in FF. PEDF was also found in luteinized GCs of the highly vascularized corpus luteum, a result not in line with a sole anti-angiogenic action. Like GCs in vivo, cultured human luteinizing GCs express PEDF. They also responded to exogenous recombinant PEDF. In low concentrations PEDF did not affect cell viability but caused generation ROS. ROS-induction by PEDF was a concentration-dependent process and may be due to the activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) type 4 and/or 5, which as we found are expressed by GCs. An antioxidant and apocynin, which inhibits NOX, blocked ROS generation. High levels of exogenous recombinant PEDF induced apoptosis of GCs, which was prevented by antioxidants, implying involvement of ROS.\nPEDF is emerging as an ovarian factor, which has unexpected ROS-augmenting activities in the human ovary.

At some specific sites, such as the vertebral body (VB) of the spine, the process of bone repair with implanted biomaterials is rarely reported. Recently, adipose tissue was found to be an alternative source of MSC besides bone marrow. However, the strategy of using adipose-derived stromal (ADS) cells with bioactive scaffold for the repair of spinal bone defects has seldom been studied.\nTo use a sintered poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) microspheres scaffold seeded with induced rat ADS cells to repair a bone defect of the VB in a rat model.\nBasic science and laboratory study.\nA sintered porous microspheres scaffold was manufactured by PLGA. ADS cells were isolated from Fischer 344 rats and then induced by osteogenic medium with growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) in\u00a0vitro. Before implantation, cells were cultured with inductive media for 2 weeks as a monolayer situation and 1 more week on a PLGA scaffold as a three-dimensional structure. These assembled bioactive scaffolds then were implanted in lumbar VB bone defects in Fischer 344 rats. The ex\u00a0vivo differentiation of the cells was confirmed by von Kossa staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The performance of cells on the scaffold was detected by scanning electron microscopy and (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. In\u00a0vivo bone formation was quantitatively measured by computed tomography study. And the effect of tissue repair was also evaluated by histological studies.\nProliferation and differentiation of cells were confirmed before in\u00a0vivo implantation. Quantification of bone formation in\u00a0vivo through serial three-dimensional computed tomography images revealed that the VB implanted with GDF5-induced cells demonstrated more bone formation than the control groups. Besides the bone formation period that occurred between 2 and 4 weeks in all groups, a second bone formation period was found to occur only in the groups that received cells with previous induction in\u00a0vitro. This second period of significant bone formation happened simultaneously with collapsing of the scaffolds. It was then demonstrated histologically that vascularization early in the process and cooperation between host bone and implanted cells accompanied by collapse of the scaffold may be the factors that influence bone formation.

{"title": "Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells from aged patients with coronary artery disease keep mesenchymal stromal cell properties but exhibit characteristics of aging and have impaired angiogenic potential.", "abstract": "Tissue regeneration is impaired in aged individuals. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs), a promising source for cell therapy, were shown to secrete various angiogenic factors and improve vascularization of ischemic tissues. We analyzed how patient age affected the angiogenic properties of ADSCs. ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous fat tissue of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD; n = 64, 43-77 years old) and without CAD (n = 31, 2-82 years old). ADSC phenotype characterized by flow cytometry was CD90(+)/CD73(+)/CD105(+)/CD45(-)/CD31(-) for all samples, and these cells were capable of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. ADSCs from aged patients had shorter telomeres (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and a tendency to attenuated telomerase activity. ADSC-conditioned media (ADSC-CM) stimulated capillary-like tube formation by endothelial cells (EA.hy926), and this effect significantly decreased with the age of patients both with and without CAD. Angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, placental growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, angiopoetin-1, and angiogenin) in ADSC-CM measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay significantly decreased with patient age, whereas levels of antiangiogenic factors thrombospondin-1 and endostatin did not. Expression of angiogenic factors in ADSCs did not change with patient age (real-time polymerase chain reaction); however, gene expression of factors related to extracellular proteolysis (urokinase and its receptor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor surface expression increased in ADSCs from aged patients with CAD. ADSCs from aged patients both with and without CAD acquire aging characteristics, and their angiogenic potential declines because of decreasing proangiogenic factor secretion. This could restrict the effectiveness of autologous cell therapy with ADSCs in aged patients.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2013-12-20", "authors": ["AnastasiaEfimenko", "NinaDzhoyashvili", "NataliaKalinina", "TatianaKochegura", "RenatAkchurin", "VsevolodTkachuk", "YelenaParfyonova"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2013-0014"}
{"title": "Notch signaling is required for the formation of mesangial cells from a stromal mesenchyme precursor during kidney development.", "abstract": "Mesangial cells are specialized pericyte/smooth muscle cells that surround and constrain the vascular network within the glomerulus of the kidney. They are derived from the stromal mesenchyme, a progenitor population distinct from nephron stem cells. Whether mesangial cells have a distinct origin from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the pathways that govern their specification are unknown. Here we show that Notch signaling in stromal progenitors is essential for mesangial cell formation but is dispensable for the smooth muscle and interstitial cell lineages. Deletion of RBPjk, the common DNA-binding partner of all active Notch receptors, with Foxd1(tgCre) results in glomerular aneurysm and perinatal death from kidney failure. This defect occurs early in glomerular development as stromal-derived, desmin-positive cells fail to coalesce near forming nephrons and thus do not invade the vascular cleft of the S-shaped body. This is in contrast to other mutants in which the loss of the mesangium was due to migration defects, and suggests that loss of Notch signaling results in a failure to specify this population from the stroma. Interestingly, Pdgfrb-positive VSMCs do not enter the vascular cleft and cannot rescue the mesangial deficiency. Notch1 and Notch2 act redundantly through \u03b3-secretase and RBPjk in this process, as individual mutants have mesangial cells at birth. Together, these data demonstrate a unique origin of mesangial cells and demonstrate a novel, redundant function for Notch receptors in mesangial cell specification, proliferation or survival during kidney development.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2013-12-20", "authors": ["Scott CBoyle", "ZhenyiLiu", "RaphaelKopan"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.100271"}

The purpose of this study is to analyze the anti-inflammatory effect of azithromycin (AZM) following experimental keratoplasty in rats.\nCorneal transplants were performed between Fisher-donor and Lewis-recipient rats. Recipients were postoperatively treated three times daily with AZM, miglyol, ofloxacin or dexamethasone eye drops. As an additional control, AZM was applied following syngeneic keratoplasty. Furthermore, short-term treatments with AZM for seven days perioperatively or with AZM only three days prior to the transplantation were compared to appropriate controls. All transplants were monitored clinically for opacity, edema, and vascularization. Infiltrating CD45(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD25(+), CD161(+) and CD163(+) cells were quantified via immunohistochemistry.\nAZM significantly promoted corneal graft survival compared with miglyol or ofloxacin treatment. This effect was comparable to topical dexamethasone. No adverse AZM effect was observed. Histology confirmed a significant reduction of infiltrating leukocytes. The short-term application of AZM for three days prior to transplantation or for seven days perioperatively reduced corneal graft rejection significantly compared with the controls.\nAlong with antibiotic properties, topical AZM has a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Following keratoplasty, this effect is comparable to topical dexamethasone without the risk of steroid-induced adverse effects. Short-term treatment with AZM three days prior to the transplantation was sufficient to promote graft survival in the rat keratoplasty model.

In this study, we addressed the question whether stabilization of Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 (GLP-1) by inhibiting Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) increases \u03b2-cell mass by modulating vascularization. Mouse or porcine donor islets were implanted under kidney capsule of diabetic mice treated with DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin. Grafts were analyzed for insulin production, \u03b2-cell proliferation and vascularization. In addition, the effect of sitagliptin on sprouting and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-A expression was examined ex vivo. The cAMP response element-binding (CREB) and VEGF-A/ Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)-2 signaling pathway leading to islet vascularization was explored. Sitagliptin increased mean insulin content of islet grafts and area of insulin-positive tissue as well as \u03b2-cell proliferation. Interestingly, sitagliptin treatment also markedly increased endothelial cell proliferation, microvessel density and blood flow. Finally, GLP-1 (7-36) stimulated sprouting and VEGF expression, which was significantly enhanced by sitagliptin- mediated inhibition of DPP-IV. Our in vivo data demonstrate that sitagliptin treatment phosphorylated CREB and induced islet vascularization through VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway.

The homology of this flange is controversial: previous studies of Fenerivia heteropetala (an aberrant species, with 12 perianth parts in three whorls) have suggested that the flange may represent a vestigial calyx resulting from a disruption to the homeotic control of organ identity during floral development. Comparative data on floral vasculature in Fenerivia capuronii are presented to elucidate the homology of the flange in other Fenerivia species (which possess nine perianth parts in three whorls, typical of most Annonaceae). The flange in F. capuronii differs from that in F.\u00a0heteropetala as it is unvascularized.

{"title": "Hypoxic tumor environments exhibit disrupted collagen I fibers and low macromolecular transport.", "abstract": "Hypoxic tumor microenvironments result in an aggressive phenotype and resistance to therapy that lead to tumor progression, recurrence, and metastasis. While poor vascularization and the resultant inadequate drug delivery are known to contribute to drug resistance, the effect of hypoxia on molecular transport through the interstitium, and the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in mediating this transport are unexplored. The dense mesh of fibers present in the ECM can especially influence the movement of macromolecules. Collagen 1 (Col1) fibers form a key component of the ECM in breast cancers. Here we characterized the influence of hypoxia on macromolecular transport in tumors, and the role of Col1 fibers in mediating this transport using an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model engineered to express red fluorescent protein under hypoxia. Magnetic resonance imaging of macromolecular transport was combined with second harmonic generation microscopy of Col1 fibers. Hypoxic tumor regions displayed significantly decreased Col1 fiber density and volume, as well as significantly lower macromolecular draining and pooling rates, than normoxic regions. Regions adjacent to severely hypoxic areas revealed higher deposition of Col1 fibers and increased macromolecular transport. These data suggest that Col1 fibers may facilitate macromolecular transport in tumors, and their reduction in hypoxic regions may reduce this transport. Decreased macromolecular transport in hypoxic regions may also contribute to poor drug delivery and tumor recurrence in hypoxic regions. High Col1 fiber density observed around hypoxic regions may facilitate the escape of aggressive cancer cells from hypoxic regions.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["Samata MKakkad", "Marie-FrancePenet", "AlirezaAkhbardeh", "Arvind PPathak", "MeiyappanSolaiyappan", "VenuRaman", "DieterLeibfritz", "KristineGlunde", "Zaver MBhujwalla"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0081869"}
{"title": "Theme and variations: amphibious air-breathing intertidal fishes.", "abstract": "Over 70 species of intertidal fishes from 12 families breathe air while emerging from water. Amphibious intertidal fishes generally have no specialized air-breathing organ but rely on vascularized mucosae and cutaneous surfaces in air to exchange both oxygen and carbon dioxide. They differ from air-breathing freshwater fishes in morphology, physiology, ecology and behaviour. Air breathing and terrestrial activity are present to varying degrees in intertidal fish species, correlated with the tidal height of their habitat. The gradient of amphibious lifestyle includes passive remainers that stay in the intertidal zone as tides ebb, active emergers that deliberately leave water in response to poor aquatic conditions and highly mobile amphibious skipper fishes that may spend more time out of water than in it. Normal terrestrial activity is usually aerobic and metabolic rates in air and water are similar. Anaerobic metabolism may be employed during forced exercise or when exposed to aquatic hypoxia. Adaptations for amphibious life include reductions in gill surface area, increased reliance on the skin for respiration and ion exchange, high affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen and adjustments to ventilation and metabolism while in air. Intertidal fishes remain close to water and do not travel far terrestrially, and are unlikely to migrate or colonize new habitats at present, although in the past this may have happened. Many fish species spawn in the intertidal zone, including some that do not breathe air, as eggs and embryos that develop in the intertidal zone benefit from tidal air emergence. With air breathing, amphibious intertidal fishes survive in a variable habitat with minimal adjustments to existing structures. Closely related species in different microhabitats provide unique opportunities for comparative studies.", "journal": "Journal of fish biology", "date": "2013-12-19", "authors": ["K LMartin"], "doi": "10.1111/jfb.12270"}

Specifically, the combination of system lateral resolution and vessel diameter in the macular region renders the process particularly complex, which might partly explain the focus on the optic disc region.

These receptors make an attractive anticancer target owing to their overexpression in variety of cancer especially in prostate and breast cancer. Inhibitors of IGF signaling were subjected to clinical cancer trials with the main objective to confirm the effectiveness of these receptors as a therapeutic target. However, the results that these trials produced proved to be disappointing as the role played by the cross talk between IGF and insulin receptor (IR) signaling pathways at the receptor level or at downstream signaling level became more lucid. Therapeutic strategy for IGF-1R and IR inhibition mainly encompasses three main approaches namely receptor blockade with monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibition (ATP antagonist and non-ATP antagonist), and ligand neutralization via monoclonal antibodies targeted to ligand or recombinant IGF-binding proteins. Other drug-discovery approaches are employed to target IGF-1R, and IR includes antisense oligonucleotides and recombinant IGF-binding proteins. However, therapies with monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibition targeting the IGF-1R are not evidenced to be satisfactory as expected. Factors that are duly held responsible for the unsuccessfulness of these therapies include (a) the existence of the IR isoform A overexpressed on a variety of cancers, enhancing the mitogenic signals to the nucleus leading to the endorsement of cell growth, (b) IGF-1R and IR that form hybrid receptors sensitive to the stimulation of all three IGF axis ligands, and (c) IGF-1R and IR that also have the potential to form hybrid receptors with other tyrosine kinase to potentiate the cellular transformation, tumorigenesis, and tumor vascularization.

{"title": "Vascularization and nutrient delivery at root-knot nematode feeding sites in host roots.", "abstract": "Plants are constantly challenged by pathogens and pests, which can have a profound impact on the yield and quality of produce in agricultural systems. The vascular system of higher plants is critical for growth and for their ability to counteract changing external conditions, serving as a distribution network for water, nutrients, and photosynthates from the source organs to regions where they are in demand. Unfortunately, these features also make it an attractive target for pathogens and pests that demand access to a reliable supply of host resources. The vascular tissue of plants therefore often plays a central role in pathogen and parasite interactions. One of the more striking rearrangements of the host vascular system occurs during root-knot nematode infestation of plant roots. These sedentary endoparasites induce permanent feeding sites that are comprised of 'giant cells' and are subject to extensive changes in vascularization, resulting in the giant cells being encaged within a network of de novo formed xylem and phloem cells. Despite being considered critical to the function of the feeding site, the mechanisms underlying this vascularization have received surprisingly little attention when compared with the amount of research on giant cell development and function.

We found altered endothelin axis mRNA expression in several clinicopathologic parameters with increased endothelin 1 expression in thyroid papillary carcinoma showing stromal calcification, cancers in men, and primary cancers with lymph node metastases. Increased endothelin receptor A mRNA expression was noted in the larger cancers. There is a significant correlation between expression of endothelin receptor A and endothelin 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both endothelin receptor A and endothelin 1 mRNA expressions were significantly higher in metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node than in primary thyroid cancer. The metastatic carcinoma in the lymph node had increased expression compared with matched primary thyroid carcinoma.

{"title": "Clinical features of precocious acute coronary syndrome.", "abstract": "Acute coronary syndrome due to acute plaque rupture has been well described and is associated with established risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. The prevalence of these risk factors in very young patients (aged \u226435 years) is not well known, and they may have other nontraditional risk factors. We hypothesized that acute coronary syndrome in very young patients may represent a thrombotic event independent of underlying atherosclerotic disease.\nWe performed a dual-institution, retrospective study of consecutive patients aged \u226435 years who presented with acute coronary syndrome and underwent coronary angiography from January 2000 to December 2011. Standard demographics, risk factors, and detailed angiographic information were obtained.\nA total of 124 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 31 \u00b1 4 years for both sexes. Approximately half (49%) of the patients were obese (body mass index \u226530 kg/m(2)); 90% of patients had at least 1 traditional risk factor, most commonly hyperlipidemia (63%) and smoking (60%); 52% of patients underwent re-vascularization, of which 94% were by percutaneous coronary intervention, and 42.9% of patients had intracoronary thrombus, of whom approximately one third had no detectable underlying coronary disease.\nVery young patients with acute coronary syndrome tend to be obese, with a high prevalence of smoking and hyperlipidemia. The presence of thrombus in the absence of underlying coronary disease suggests a thromboembolic event or de novo thrombotic occlusion, which may reflect primary hemostatic dysfunction in a considerable number of these patients.", "journal": "The American journal of medicine", "date": "2013-12-18", "authors": ["LauraDavidson", "JaneWilcox", "DavidKim", "StewartBenton", "JosephFredi", "DouglasVaughan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.amjmed.2013.09.025"}

{"title": "Revision of humeral components in shoulder arthroplasty.", "abstract": "Revision of a shoulder arthroplasty often requires removal of a well fixed humeral component. Revision of this component can be quite easy in the case of a non-infected platform stem or be very difficult when removal of a well cemented or on-growth stem with distal texturing is required. The purpose of this paper is to provide a series of techniques designed for revision of the humeral component in shoulder arthroplasty. Revision of the stem can be easy with a non-infected platform stem only requiring exchange of the epiphyseal component. Some stems, usually uncemented, can readily be removed from a proximal only approach. Stems with excellent cement mantles may require a longitudinal only split in the humerus done with minimal stripping of the brachialis. If complete cement removal is needed for infection or there is distal stem on growth, then a vascularized door technique is indicated.

{"title": "Connexin 36 mediates blood cell flow in mouse pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "The insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells are contained within islets of Langerhans, which are highly vascularized. Blood cell flow rates through islets are glucose-dependent, even though there are no changes in blood cell flow within in the surrounding exocrine pancreas. This suggests a specific mechanism of glucose-regulated blood flow in the islet. Pancreatic islets respond to elevated glucose with synchronous pulses of electrical activity and insulin secretion across all \u03b2-cells in the islet. Connexin 36 (Cx36) gap junctions between islet \u03b2-cells mediate this synchronization, which is lost in Cx36 knockout mice (Cx36(-/-)). This leads to glucose intolerance in these mice, despite normal plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity. Thus, we sought to investigate whether the glucose-dependent changes in intraislet blood cell flow are also dependent on coordinated pulsatile electrical activity. We visualized and quantified blood cell flow using high-speed in vivo fluorescence imaging of labeled red blood cells and plasma. With the use of a live animal glucose clamp, blood cell flow was measured during either hypoglycemia (\u223c50 mg/dl) or hyperglycemia (\u223c300 mg/dl). In contrast to the large glucose-dependent islet blood velocity changes observed in wild-type mice, only minimal differences are observed in both Cx36(+/-) and Cx36(-/-) mice. This observation supports a novel model where intraislet blood cell flow is regulated by the coordinated electrical activity in the islet \u03b2-cells. Because Cx36 expression and function is reduced in type 2 diabetes, the resulting defect in intraislet blood cell flow regulation may also play a significant role in diabetic pathology.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

To assure optimal islet cell quality, specialized islet isolation facilities have been developed.

Despite its importance, a clinically feasible solution for the transport of islets has still not been established. We here compare the functionality of isolated islets from C57BL/6 mice directly after the isolation procedure as well as after two simulated transport conditions, static versus rotation. Islet cell quality was assessed using real-time live confocal microscopy. In vivo islet function after syngeneic transplantation was determined by weight and blood sugar measurements as well as by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests. Vascularization of islets was documented by fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. All viability parameters documented comparable cell viability in the rotary group and the group transplanted immediately after isolation. Functional parameters assessed in vivo displayed no significant difference between these two groups. Moreover, vascularization of islets was similar in both groups. In conclusion, rotary culture conditions allows the maintenance of highest islet quality for at least 15 h, which is comparable to that of freshly isolated islets.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2013-12-11", "authors": ["RupertOberhuber", "ChristofMittermair", "BettinaZelger", "DanielaPirkebner", "AnnaDraxl", "AnnemarieWeissenbacher", "ThomasResch", "ChristianMargreiter", "RobertSucher", "RaimundMargreiter", "JohannPratschke", "PaulHengster", "MartinHermann"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/975608"}

{"title": "3-D visualization and quantitation of microvessels in transparent human colorectal carcinoma [corrected].", "abstract": "Microscopic analysis of tumor vasculature plays an important role in understanding the progression and malignancy of colorectal carcinoma. However, due to the geometry of blood vessels and their connections, standard microtome-based histology is limited in providing the spatial information of the vascular network with a 3-dimensional (3-D) continuum. To facilitate 3-D tissue analysis, we prepared transparent human colorectal biopsies by optical clearing for in-depth confocal microscopy with CD34 immunohistochemistry. Full-depth colons were obtained from colectomies performed for colorectal carcinoma. Specimens were prepared away from (control) and at the tumor site. Taking advantage of the transparent specimens, we acquired anatomic information up to 200 \u03bcm in depth for qualitative and quantitative analyses of the vasculature. Examples are given to illustrate: (1) the association between the tumor microstructure and vasculature in space, including the perivascular cuffs of tumor outgrowth, and (2) the difference between the 2-D and 3-D quantitation of microvessels. We also demonstrate that the optically cleared mucosa can be retrieved after 3-D microscopy to perform the standard microtome-based histology (H&E staining and immunohistochemistry) for systematic integration of the two tissue imaging methods. Overall, we established a new tumor histological approach to integrate 3-D imaging, illustration, and quantitation of human colonic microvessels in normal and cancerous specimens.

The degradation time of the hydrogels could be controlled between 1 and 7 weeks, based on hydrogel composition. Fibrin was incorporated into the interconnected pores of the hydrogels to promote neovascularization and as a reservoir for rapid (<5 days) growth factor delivery. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres were incorporated into the degradable polymeric hydrogel scaffold to allow sustained (>30 days) growth factor delivery. Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were delivered from the system owing to their roles in the promotion of angiogenesis and vascular stabilization, respectively. Hydrogels tested in vivo with a subcutaneous implantation model were selected based on the results from in vitro degradation and growth factor release kinetics. Dual growth factor delivery promoted significantly more tissue ingrowth in the scaffold compared with blank or single growth factor delivery. The sequential delivery of FGF-1 following PDGF-BB promoted more persistent and mature blood vessels.

{"title": "Total spontaneous regression of a central giant cell granuloma after incisional biopsy: a four-year follow-up case report.", "abstract": "Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) of the jaws represents a localized and benign neoplastic lesion sometimes characterized by aggressive osteolytic proliferation. The World Health Organization defines it as an intraosseous lesion composed of cellular and dense connective tissues that contain multiple hemorrhagic foci, an aggregation of multinucleated giant cells, and occasional bone tissue trabeculae. The origin of this lesion is uncertain; however, factors such as local trauma, inflammation, intraosseous hemorrhage, and genetic abnormalities have been identified as possible causes. CGCG generally affects those younger than 30\u00a0years and occurs more frequently in women (2:1). This lesion corresponds to approximately 7% of all benign tumors of the jaws, with prevalence in the anterior region of the jaw. Aggressive lesions are characterized by symptoms, such as pain, numbness, rapid growth, cortical perforation, root resorption, and a high recurrence rate after curettage. In contrast, nonaggressive CGCGs have a slow rate of growth, may contain sparse trabeculation, and are less likely to move teeth or cause root resorption or cortical perforation. Nonaggressive CGCGs are generally asymptomatic lesions and thus are frequently found on routine dental radiographs. Radiographically, the 2 forms of CGCG present as radiolucent, expansive, unilocular or multilocular masses with well-defined margins. The histopathology of CGCG is characterized by multinucleated giant cells, surrounded by round, oval, and spindle-shaped mononuclear cells, scattered in dense connective tissue with hemorrhagic and abundant vascularization foci. The final diagnosis is determined by histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimen. The preferred treatment for CGCG consists of excisional biopsy, curettage with a safety margin, and partial or total resection of the affected bone. Conservative treatments include local injections of steroids, calcitonin, and antiangiogenic therapy. Drug treatment using antibiotics, painkillers, and corticosteroids and clinical and radiographic monitoring are necessary for approximately 10\u00a0days after surgery.

Polyester-polyurethane sponges, used as a framework for fibrovascular tissue growth, were implanted in Swiss albino mice and camel milk (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day) was administered for 14 days through installed cannula. The implants collected at day 14 post-implantation were processed for the assessment of hemoglobin (Hb), myeloperoxidase (MPO), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and collagen, which were used as indices for angiogenesis, neutrophil, and macrophage accumulation and extracellular matrix deposition, respectively. Relevant inflammatory, angiogenic, and fibrogenic cytokines were also determined. Camel milk treatment attenuated the main components of the fibrovascular tissue, wet weight, vascularization (Hb content), macrophage recruitment (NAG activity), collagen deposition and the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2.

{"title": "The Methanol Extract of Angelica sinensis Induces Cell Apoptosis and Suppresses Tumor Growth in Human Malignant Brain Tumors.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly vascularized and invasive neoplasm. The methanol extract of Angelica sinensis (AS-M) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat several diseases, such as gastric mucosal damage, hepatic injury, menopausal symptoms, and chronic glomerulonephritis. AS-M also displays potency in suppressing the growth of malignant brain tumor cells. The growth suppression of malignant brain tumor cells by AS-M results from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. AS-M upregulates expression of cyclin kinase inhibitors, including p16, to decrease the phosphorylation of Rb proteins, resulting in arrest at the G0-G1 phase. The expression of the p53 protein is increased by AS-M and correlates with activation of apoptosis-associated proteins. Therefore, the apoptosis of cancer cells induced by AS-M may be triggered through the p53 pathway. In in vivo studies, AS-M not only suppresses the growth of human malignant brain tumors but also significantly prolongs patient survival. In addition, AS-M has potent anticancer effects involving cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and antiangiogenesis. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of AS-M indicate that this extract warrants further investigation and potential development as a new antibrain tumor agent, providing new hope for the chemotherapy of malignant brain cancer.", "journal": "Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM", "date": "2013-12-10", "authors": ["Yu-LingLin", "Wen-LinLai", "Horng-JyhHarn", "Pei-HsiuHung", "Ming-ChangHsieh", "Kai-FuChang", "Xiao-FanHuang", "Kuang-WenLiao", "Ming-ShihLee", "Nu-ManTsai"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/394636"}
{"title": "Engineered skeletal muscle tissue for soft robotics: fabrication strategies, current applications, and future challenges.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a scalable actuator system used throughout nature from the millimeter to meter length scales and over a wide range of frequencies and force regimes. This adaptability has spurred interest in using engineered skeletal muscle to power soft robotics devices and in biotechnology and medical applications. However, the challenges to doing this are similar to those facing the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine fields; specifically, how do we translate our understanding of myogenesis in vivo to the engineering of muscle constructs in vitro to achieve functional integration with devices. To do this researchers are developing a number of ways to engineer the cellular microenvironment to guide skeletal muscle tissue formation. This includes understanding the role of substrate stiffness and the mechanical environment, engineering the spatial organization of biochemical and physical cues to guide muscle alignment, and developing bioreactors for mechanical and electrical conditioning. Examples of engineered skeletal muscle that can potentially be used in soft robotics include 2D cantilever-based skeletal muscle actuators and 3D skeletal muscle tissues engineered using scaffolds or directed self-organization. Integration into devices has led to basic muscle-powered devices such as grippers and pumps as well as more sophisticated muscle-powered soft robots that walk and swim. Looking forward, current, and future challenges include identifying the best source of muscle precursor cells to expand and differentiate into myotubes, replacing cardiomyocytes with skeletal muscle tissue as the bio-actuator of choice for soft robots, and vascularization and innervation to enable control and nourishment of larger muscle tissue constructs.", "journal": "Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Tumor osteolysis was induced by in situ inoculation of Walker 256/B malignant cells. Six other rats were sham operated and served as control. Twenty days later, rats were euthanized, and femurs were collected than radiographed. Angioarchitecture [mean lumen diameter (MLD), wall thickness (WTh), Vessel number, volume, and separation (VNb, VV, and VSp respectively)] was studied by histomorphometry at 2 different positions (P1: diaphysis, and P2: metaphysis) of the operated femora. Some hematological parameters were also assessed. Walker 256/B induced marked tumor osteolysis, with cortical perforation and trabecular destruction, associated increase in bone vascularization (increases of VNb and VV and decrease of VSp). Angioarchitecture of W256/B rats was disorganized and showed large MLD and lower WTh. These effects were more prominent in P2. When compared to Sham group, significantly decreases at levels of red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), and white blood cell (WBC) were observed in W256/B rats. These results suggest that Walker 256/B cells induced tumor osteolysis, improve hypervasculature especially near the tumoral foci (P2) associated hematological disruption.

Ten non-embalmed legs from cadavers were used. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were done at the middle third of the tendon. Magnetic resonance images of the hind foot were made in 60 living subjects to analyze the morphological alterations of tendon and paratenon. The paratenon is a thick fibrous layer with few elastic fibers, continuous with the crural fascia, well vascularized and innervated. It forms a sheath around the tendon similar to a synovial layer, but less organized. Indeed, it has no complete epithelium, but only some cells producing hyaluronan, called fasciacytes. Crural fascia and paratenon can be clearly observed by MRI, appearing as homogeneous, low signal intensity bands, sharply defined in the context of subcutaneous tissue in T1-weighted sequences. The mean thickness of the crural fascia was 1.11 mm in healthy subjects and 1.30 mm in patients (p < 0.005). The mean value of paratenon thickness in patients was 1.34 mm, 0.85 in healthy (p < 0.0001). The paratenon is more highly vascularized and innervated than the tendon, supporting the hypothesis that it is the origin of pain in tendinopathy. The imaging study suggests that, an increase in the thickness of the paratenon more than 1.35 mm is predictive of paratendinopathy, even before tendon damage.", "journal": "Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA", "date": "2013-12-10", "authors": ["CarlaStecco", "AlessandroCappellari", "VeronicaMacchi", "AndreaPorzionato", "AldoMorra", "AntonioBerizzi", "RaffaeleDe Caro"], "doi": "10.1007/s00276-013-1244-8"}

Despite novel insights into their pathobiology provided by recent genome-wide molecular studies, several entities remain poorly characterized. In addition to the neoplastic cell population, PTCLs have a microenvironment component, composed of non-tumor cells and stroma, which is quantitatively and qualitatively variable, and which may have an effect on their pathological and clinical features. The best example is provided by angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), a designation reflecting the typical vascularization and reactive immunoblastic content of the tumor tissues. In this disease, a complex network of interactions between the lymphoma cells and the microenvironment exists, presumably mediated by the neoplastic T cells with follicular helper T-cell properties.

{"title": "The role of tumor-associated macrophages in tumor vascularization.", "abstract": "Tumor vascularization is a highly complex process that involves the interaction between tumors and their surrounding stroma, as well as many distinct angiogenesis-regulating factors. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) represent one of the most abundant cell components in the tumor environment and key contributors to cancer-related inflammation. A large body of evidence supports the notion that TAMs play a critical role in promoting the formation of an abnormal tumor vascular network and subsequent tumor progression and invasion. Clinical and experimental evidence has shown that high levels of infiltrating TAMs are associated with poor patient prognosis and tumor resistance to therapies. In addition to stimulating angiogenesis during tumor growth, TAMs enhance tumor revascularization in response to cytotoxic therapy (e.g., radiotherapy), thereby causing cancer relapse. In this review, we highlight the emerging data related to the phenotype and polarization of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment, as well as the underlying mechanisms of macrophage function in the regulation of the angiogenic switch and tumor vascularization. Additionally, we discuss the potential of targeting pro-angiogenic TAMs, or reprograming TAMs toward a tumoricidal and angiostatic phenotype, to promote normalization of the tumor vasculature to enhance the outcome of cancer therapies.", "journal": "Vascular cell", "date": "2013-12-10", "authors": ["ChunqingGuo", "AnnicoleBuranych", "DevanandSarkar", "Paul BFisher", "Xiang-YangWang"], "doi": "10.1186/2045-824X-5-20\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9\n10.1038/nm0603-653\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80108-7\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014\n10.1038/nri2528\n10.1016/j.immuni.2010.05.007\n10.1038/nri3073\n10.1038/nrc1782\n10.1038/nature01322\n10.1038/nature07205\n10.1038/nrc2444\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2009.05.003\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.007\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.02.005\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4672\n10.1182/blood-2009-01-200931\n10.1016/j.ejca.2004.03.016\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4005\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2008.03.004\n10.1016/S1471-4906(02)02302-5\n10.1182/blood-2005-01-0428\n10.1182/blood-2008-12-172825\n10.4049/jimmunol.0902360\n10.1189/jlb.1105656\n10.1016/j.celrep.2011.12.005\n10.1073/pnas.1104303108\n10.1186/1479-5876-9-216\n10.1002/path.1027\n10.1182/blood-2009-11-253260\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01614.x\n10.1038/nature10138\n10.1016/j.it.2011.12.001\n10.1016/j.mam.2011.04.005\n10.1084/jem.20080108\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0269\n10.4049/jimmunol.1103378\n10.1016/j.cmet.2007.06.010\n10.1182/blood-2011-02-339911\n10.4049/jimmunol.1201650\n10.1097/CCO.0b013e32831bed7e\n10.1084/jem.193.6.727\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1278\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2904\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.080676\n10.1002/1096-9896(2000)9999:9999<::AID-PATH687>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0912\n10.1016/j.molonc.2007.10.003\n10.1038/nature07445\n10.1158/2159-8274.CD-10-0028\n10.1172/JCI65385\n10.1189/jlb.0905495\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.038\n10.1096/fj.10-179473\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1354\n10.1016/j.tcb.2010.12.002\n10.1101/gad.1874010\n10.1002/ijc.28238\n10.1083/jcb.201102147\n10.1038/35036374\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00139-2\n10.1172/JCI200422087\n10.1016/j.ccr.2007.11.032\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.034\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199708)182:4<414::AID-PATH897>3.0.CO;2-Q\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0961\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0202\n10.1002/path.3989\n10.1002/1097-0142(20010901)92:5<1085::AID-CNCR1424>3.0.CO;2-K\n10.1182/blood-2004-03-1109\n10.1093/jnci/djq044\n10.1074/jbc.M109.042671\n10.1038/nrc1388\n10.1038/nm1075\n10.1172/JCI44562\n10.1172/JCI40283\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4446\n10.1182/blood-2009-12-258186\n10.1038/nrc2524\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.039\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.009\n10.1172/JCI35213\n10.1111/cas.12015\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1217\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1474\n10.1002/jso.23110\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2684\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6241\n10.1002/jcb.24438\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.04.010\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62038-X\n10.1007/s12032-012-0212-1\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208719\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-2177\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0215\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1104\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3314\n10.1038/nm871\n10.1038/icb.2008.19\n10.1182/blood-2010-02-266296\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.08.002\n10.1182/blood-2006-10-053504\n10.1002/hep.25965\n10.1038/nrm2639\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0012\n10.1038/nri2506\n10.1038/nri3175\n10.1016/j.ccr.2004.08.031\n10.1172/JCI31422\n10.1084/jem.20100587\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422758\n10.1038/nrd3455\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1038/nature06348\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0925\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6603240\n10.1182/blood-2009-08-237412\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3523\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.01.008\n10.1126/science.1082504\n10.1007/s10911-010-9194-9\n10.1073/pnas.0911378107\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3981\n10.1038/472303a\n10.1016/S1470-2045(03)01196-3\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0471\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.09.004\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.12.019\n10.1126/science.1104819\n10.1093/jnci/djm056\n10.1016/j.gde.2010.10.008\n10.1016/j.mam.2011.04.005\n10.1126/science.1198443"}
{"title": "Lysophosphatidic acid enhances stromal cell-directed angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Ischemic diseases such as peripheral vascular disease (PVD) affect more than 15% of the general population and in severe cases result in ulcers, necrosis, and limb loss. While the therapeutic delivery of growth factors to promote angiogenesis has been widely investigated, large-scale implementation is limited by strategies to effectively deliver costly recombinant proteins. Multipotent adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) and progenitor cells from other tissue compartments secrete bioactive concentrations of angiogenic molecules, making cell-based strategies for in situ delivery of angiogenic cytokines an exciting alternative to the use of recombinant proteins. Here, we show that the phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) synergistically improves the proangiogenic effects of ASC in ischemia. We found that LPA upregulates angiogenic growth factor production by ASC under two- and three-dimensional in vitro models of serum deprivation and hypoxia (SD/H), and that these factors significantly enhance endothelial cell migration.

{"title": "Hyperplastic corneal pannus: an immunohistochemical analysis and review.", "abstract": "An exuberant corneal pannus usually develops in adults with a history of surgery or trauma in the anterior central stroma and appears as a glistening, vascularized, moderately elevated, well circumscribed white nodule. We describe a 78-year-old woman with such a pannus, which in the past has typically been referred to as keloidal or hypertrophic. The involved eye had only light perception, and she underwent a penetrating keratoplasty that improved her vision to 20/100. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations of a the specimen disclosed a reactive spindle cell stromal proliferation of myofibroblasts that were smooth muscle actin positive with a low Ki67 proliferation index. Desmin, caldesmon, and calponin were negative, in keeping with the incomplete myofilamentary differentiation of a myofibroblast. There was a generous admixture of CD68/163-positive histiocytes and dispersed C3/5-positive T-lymphocytes. An absence of CD138- and IgG4-positive plasma cells ruled out an IgG4-related disease. For a lesion to be keloidal, the collagen must have a thick hyaline character, sharp edges, and a sparsity of intervening cells and vessels. A hypertrophic pannus would be composed of large swollen cells not necessarily increased in number. We therefore recommend adoption of the term hyperplastic for lesions like that described here because of the obvious increase in cellularity from proliferating myofibroblasts and the lack of true keloidal collagen.", "journal": "Survey of ophthalmology", "date": "2013-12-07", "authors": ["Frederick AJakobiec", "Rebecca CStacy", "Pia RMendoza", "JamesChodosh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.survophthal.2013.10.005"}

DNAzymes are synthetic single-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules that can cleave ribonucleic acids (RNAs). Here, we conducted a comprehensive in vitro selection of active DNAzymes for their activity to cleave the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR-1) mRNA and screened for their biological activity in a matrigel tube-formation assay. Among the selected DNAzymes, DT18 was defined as a lead molecule that was further investigated in several model systems. In a rat corneal vascularization model, DT18 demonstrated significant and specific antiangiogenic activity, as evidenced by the reduced area and vessel number in VEGF-induced corneal angiogenesis. In a mouse melanoma model, DT18 was shown to inhibit B16 tumor growth, whereas it did not affect B16 cell proliferation. We further assessed the DT18 effect in mice with established human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed, which accompanied downregulation of VEGFR-1 expression in NPC tumor tissues. To evaluate DT18 effect on vasculature, we performed dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) on the human NPC xenograft mice treated with DT18 and showed a reduction of the parameter of K(trans) (volume constant for transfer of contrast agent), which reflects the condition of tumor microvascular permeability. When examining the safety and tolerability of DT18, intravenous administration of Dz18 to healthy mice caused no substantial toxicities, as shown by parameters such as body weight, liver/kidney function, and histological and biochemical analyses.

{"title": "Dynamics of VEGF matrix-retention in vascular network patterning.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a central regulator of blood vessel morphogenesis, although its role in patterning of endothelial cells into vascular networks is not fully understood. It has been suggested that binding of soluble VEGF to extracellular matrix components causes spatially restricted cues that guide endothelial cells into network patterns. Yet, current evidence for such a mechanism remains indirect. In this study, we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of VEGF retention in a controlled in vitro situation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) in Matrigel. We show that fluorescent VEGF accumulates in pericellular areas and colocalizes with VEGF binding molecules. Analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching reveals that binding/unbinding to matrix molecules dominates VEGF dynamics in the pericellular region. Computational simulations using our experimental measurements of kinetic parameters show that matrix retention of chemotactic signals can lead to the formation of reticular cellular networks on a realistic timescale.

{"title": "Three types of dermal grafts in rats: the importance of mechanical property and structural design.", "abstract": "To determine how the mechanical property and micro structure affect tissue regeneration and angiogenesis, three types of scaffolds were studied. Acellular dermal matrices (ADM), produced from human skin by removing the epidermis and cells, has been widely used in wound healing because of its high mechanical strength. Collagen scaffolds (CS) incorporated with poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) (PLGA) mesh forms a well-supported hybrid dermal equivalent poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) mesh/collagen scaffolds (PMCS). We designed this scaffold to enhance the CS mechanical property. These three different dermal substitutes-ADM, CS and PMCSs are different in the tensile properties and microstructure.\nSeveral basic physical characteristics of dermal substitutes were investigated in vitro. To characterize the angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, the materials were embedded subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. At weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 post-surgery, the tissue specimens were harvested for histology, immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\nIn vitro studies demonstrated ADM had a higher Young's modulus (6.94\u00a0MPa) rather than CS (0.19\u00a0MPa) and PMCS (3.33\u00a0MPa) groups in the wet state. Compared with ADMs and CSs, PMCSs with three-dimensional porous structures resembling skin and moderate mechanical properties can promote tissue ingrowth more quickly after implantation. In addition, the vascularization of the PMCS group is more obvious than that of the other two groups. The incorporation of a PLGA knitted mesh in CSs can improve the mechanical properties with little influence on the three-dimensional porous microstructure. After implantation, PMCSs can resist the contraction and promote cell infiltration, neotissue formation and blood vessel ingrowth, especially from the mesh side. Although ADM has high mechanical strength, its vascularization is poor because the pore size is too small. In conclusion, the mechanical properties of scaffolds are important for maintaining the three-dimensional microarchitecture of constructs used to induce tissue regeneration and vascularization.\nThe results illustrated that tissue regeneration requires the proper pore size and an appropriate mechanical property like PMCS which could satisfy these conditions to sustain growth.", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "date": "2013-12-07", "authors": ["ChuangangYou", "XingangWang", "YurongZheng", "ChunmaoHan"], "doi": "10.1186/1475-925X-12-125\n10.1097/00007890-199909270-00021\n10.1007/s00383-010-2777-0\n10.1016/j.otc.2004.10.003\n10.1016/j.burns.2009.07.012\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0125\n10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.003\n10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0298\n10.1001/jama.1988.03720170042031\n10.1006/jsre.1996.0210\n10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0161\n10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0007\n10.1016/j.actbio.2011.06.020\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.07.030\n10.1021/bm101446k\n10.1016/j.jvs.2011.05.023\n10.1088/1748-6041/6/4/045011\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.04.012\n10.1089/107632703322066615\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.09.058\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.07.034\n10.1016/j.dental.2009.03.007\n10.4161/cam.4.3.11747\n10.1007/s10856-010-4177-3\n10.1016/S0142-9612(03)00374-0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.070\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.06.013\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199907)46:1<60::AID-JBM7>3.0.CO;2-H\n10.1083/jcb.142.3.873\n10.1038/nm.1985\n10.1038/nrm809\n10.1002/adma.200802977\n10.1243/09544119JEIM633\n10.1016/j.actbio.2008.01.003\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.09.063\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.02.052\n10.1163/092050609X12481751806295\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.07.054\n10.1007/s10856-009-3876-0\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2003.09.092\n10.1007/s10856-007-3088-4\n10.1007/s00266-010-9631-6\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.10.044\n10.1172/JCI118106\n10.1089/teb.2007.0318"}

In 24 Wistar rats, a standardized 2\u00d74\u2009cm fascial defect was created and repaired with either cross-linked or noncross-linked grafts enriched with stem cells. Non-MSC-enriched grafts were used as controls. The rats were sacrificed at 3 months of age. The specimens were examined for the strength of incorporation, vascularization, cell invasion, foreign body reaction, and capsule formation. Both materials showed cellular ingrowth and neovascularization. Comparison of both tested groups with the controls showed no significant differences in the capsule thickness, foreign body reaction, cellularization, or vascularization. The strength of incorporation of the stem cell-enriched cross-linked extracellular matrix specimens was higher than in acellular specimens, but this result was statistically nonsignificant. In the noncross-linked extracellular matrix, the strength of incorporation was significantly higher in the stem cell group than in the acellular group. Seeding of biological meshes with stem cells does not significantly contribute to their increased vascularization. In cross-linked materials, it does not ensure increased strength of incorporation, in contrast to noncross-linked materials.

Cervical LN involvement determenes the extent of surgery. Complete surgical resection disease at the initial operation decreases likelihood of future surgery for recurrent disease and may impact survival. We use a new technique, B-flow imaging (BFI), recently used for evaluation of thyroid nodules, to estimate the presence of BFI twinkling signs (BFI-TS), within metastatic LNs in patients with PTC.\nBetween September 2006 and December 2012, 304 patients with known PTC were examined for preoperative sonographic evaluation with gray-scale US, color Doppler US and BFI. Only 157 with at least one metastatic LN were included in our study. All patients included underwent surgery, and the final diagnosis was based on the results of histologic examination of the resected specimens.

We also investigated the effects of exogenous supplementation of recombinant human hevin (rhHevin) to rescue the stromal cellular components damaged by the excimer laser.\nWild type (WT) and hevin (-/-) mice were divided into three groups at 4 time points- 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. Group I served as na\u00efve without any treatment. Group II received epithelial debridement and underwent IrrPTK using excimer laser. Group III received topical application of rhHevin after IrrPTK surgery for 3 days. Eyes were analyzed for corneal haze and matrix remodeling components using slit lamp biomicroscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy, light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB). IHC showed upregulation of hevin in IrrPTK-injured WT mice. Hevin (-/-) mice developed corneal haze as early as 1-2 weeks post IrrPTK-treatment compared to the WT group, which peaked at 3-4 weeks. They also exhibited accumulation of inflammatory cells, fibrotic components of ECM proteins and vascularized corneas as seen by IHC and WB. LM and TEM showed activated keratocytes (myofibroblasts), inflammatory debris and vascular tissues in the stroma. Exogenous application of rhHevin for 3 days reinstated inflammatory index of the corneal stroma similar to WT mice.\nHevin is transiently expressed in the IrrPTK-injured corneas and loss of hevin predisposes them to aberrant wound healing. Hevin (-/-) mice develop early corneal haze characterized by severe chronic inflammation and stromal fibrosis that can be rescued with exogenous administration of rhHevin. Thus, hevin plays a pivotal role in the corneal wound healing.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-12-05", "authors": ["Shyam SChaurasia", "Promoda RPerera", "RebekahPoh", "Rayne RLim", "Tina TWong", "Jodhbir SMehta"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0081544\n10.1016/S1350-9462(01)00008-8\n10.1016/S1350-9462(98)00021-4\n10.1097/00055735-199608000-00002\n10.1097/00055735-200408000-00006\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.11.001\n10.1016/S1350-9462(98)00021-4\n10.1038/nrm809\n10.1038/sj.jid.5700613\n10.1016/S0014-4835(09)00247-4\n10.1097/01.ico.0000178743.06340.2c\n10.1016/j.exer.2007.06.009\n10.1016/j.biocel.2003.12.003\n10.1177/002215549904701201\n10.1177/002215549704500607\n10.1016/j.biocel.2004.01.017\n10.1016/0896-6273(90)90452-L\n10.1016/S0006-8993(02)02270-9\n10.1046/j.1365-2052.2001.00778.x\n10.1016/1074-7613(95)90083-7\n10.1016/0006-8993(94)91540-7\n10.1016/S0169-328X(99)00336-8\n10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03141-3\n10.1074/jbc.271.8.4511\n10.1074/jbc.M510507200\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.11.082\n10.1593/neo.06646\n10.1167/iovs.10-5428\n10.1111/j.1524-475X.2008.00370.x\n10.1016/j.exer.2007.10.014\n10.1016/j.exer.2010.04.007\n10.1016/j.exer.2008.02.001\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62312-7\n10.1016/S0014-4835(02)00251-8\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.03.022\n10.1016/j.ophtha.2004.07.035\n10.1007/s004170000182\n10.1016/j.ajo.2011.10.002\n10.1097/ICO.0b013e31812f6d14\n10.1016/j.exer.2009.03.001\n10.1016/j.biocel.2011.12.021\n10.1016/S1350-9462(02)00064-2\n10.1159/000265406\n10.1074/jbc.271.8.4511\n10.1126/science.289.5482.1197\n10.1177/41.10.8245406"}
{"title": "Concise review: cell-based strategies in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.", "abstract": "Cellular strategies play an important role in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (BTE/RM). Variability in cell culture procedures (e.g., cell types, cell isolation and expansion, cell seeding methods, and preculture conditions before in vivo implantation) may influence experimental outcome. Meanwhile, outcomes from initial clinical trials are far behind those of animal studies, which is suggested to be related to insufficient nutrient and oxygen supply inside the BTE/RM constructs as some complex clinical implementations require bone regeneration in too large a quantity. Coculture strategies, in which angiogenic cells are introduced into osteogenic cell cultures, might provide a solution for improving vascularization and hence increasing bone formation for cell-based constructs. So far, preclinical studies have demonstrated that cell-based tissue-engineered constructs generally induce more bone formation compared with acellular constructs. Further, cocultures have been shown to enhance vascularization and bone formation compared with monocultures. However, translational efficacy from animal studies to clinical use requires improvement, and the role implanted cells play in clinical bone regeneration needs to be further elucidated. In view of this, the present review provides an overview of the critical procedures during in vitro and in vivo phases for cell-based strategies (both monoculture and coculture) in BTE/RM to achieve more standardized culture conditions for future studies, and hence enhance bone formation.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2013-12-05", "authors": ["JinlingMa", "Sanne KBoth", "FangYang", "Fu-ZhaiCui", "JuliPan", "Gert JMeijer", "John AJansen", "Jeroen J J Pvan den Beucken"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2013-0126"}

The SHBG increased in all the subjects, and both FAI and FEI decreased. The clitoral volume decreased in all the women. The PI of the dorsal clitoral artery increased only in patients on OC. The hormonal contraception was associated, in both studied groups, with a significant decrease of the two-factor Italian MFSQ score, which was more marked in OC users. In group I subjects, there was a reduction of the number of intercourse/week and a reduction of orgasm frequency during intercourse. The pain during intercourse worsened after OC use. The vaginal ring users reported a vaginal wetness.\nSix-month treatment with hormonal contraception is associated with a diminished MFSQ score.

State-of-the-art photoacoustic breast imaging systems are promising but are limited either by only a 2D imaging capability or by an insufficient imaging field-of-view (FOV). We present a laboratory prototype system designed for 3D photoacoustic full breast tomography, and comprehensively characterize it and evaluate its performance in imaging phantoms. The heart of the system is an ultrasound detector array specifically developed for breast imaging and optimized for high sensitivity. Each detector element has an acoustic lens to enlarge the acceptance angle of the large surface area detector elements to ensure a wide system FOV. We characterized the ultrasound detector array performance in terms of frequency response, directional sensitivity, minimum detectable pressure and inter-element electrical and mechanical cross-talk. Further we evaluated the system performance of the laboratory prototype imager using well-defined breast mimicking phantoms. The system possesses a 2 mm XY plane resolution and a 6 mm vertical resolution. A vasculature mimicking object was successfully visualized down to a depth of 40 mm in the breast phantom. Further, tumor mimicking spherical objects with 5 and 10 mm diameter at 20 mm and 40 mm depths are recovered, indicating high system sensitivity. The system has a 170 \u00d7 170 \u00d7 170 mm(3) FOV, which is well suited for full breast imaging.

Canine and porcine whole-heart discrete arterial models were extracted from high-resolution cryomicrotome vessel image stacks. Five parameterisation methods were considered that are primarily distinguished by the level of anatomical data used in the definition of the permeability and pressure-coupling fields. Continuum multi-compartment porous perfusion model pressure results derived using these parameterisation methods were compared quantitatively via a root-mean-square metric to the Poiseuille pressure solved on the discrete arterial vasculature. The use of anatomical detail to parameterise the porous medium significantly improved the continuum pressure results. The majority of this improvement was attributed to the use of anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. It was found that the best results were most reliably obtained by using porosity-scaled isotropic permeabilities and anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields.

{"title": "An update in the use of antibodies to treat glioblastoma multiforme.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a deadly brain disease and modest improvement in survival has been made. At initial diagnosis, treatment consists of maximum safe surgical resection, followed by temozolomide and chemoirradiation or adjuvant temozolomide alone. However, these treatments do not improve the prognosis and survival of patients. New treatment strategies are being sought according to the biology of tumors. The epidermal growth factor receptor has been considered as the hallmark in glioma tumors; thereby, some antibodies have been designed to bind to this receptor and block the downstream signaling pathways. Also, it is known that vascularization plays an important role in supplying new vessels to the tumor; therefore, new therapy has been guided to inhibit angiogenic growth factors in order to limit tumor growth. An innovative strategy in the treatment of glial tumors is the use of toxins produced by bacteria, which may be coupled to specific carrier-ligands and used for tumoral targeting. These carrier-ligands provide tumor-selective properties by the recognition of a cell-surface receptor on the tumor cells and promote their binding of the toxin-carrier complex prior to entry into the cell. Here, we reviewed some strategies to improve the management and treatment of glioblastoma and focused on the use of antibodies.", "journal": "Autoimmune diseases", "date": "2013-12-03", "authors": ["Norma YHern\u00e1ndez-Pedro", "EdgarRangel-L\u00f3pez", "GustavoVargas F\u00e9lix", "Benjam\u00ednPineda", "JulioSotelo"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/716813"}

Gore-Tex\u00ae is the material of choice that is traditionally used to repair thoracic defects. This material is well accepted by the recipient; however, though not rejected, it is an inert material and behaves like a 'foreign body' within the thoracic wall. By contrast, there are materials that have the potential to physiologically integrate into the host, and these materials are currently under in\u00a0vitro and also in\u00a0vivo investigation. These materials offer a gradual but complete biodegradation over time, and severe adverse inflammatory responses can be avoided. Here, we present a novel material that is a biodegradable nanocomposite based on poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles in comparison to the traditionally employed Gore-Tex\u00ae being the standard for chest-wall replacement. On a mouse model of thoracic wall resection, that resembles the technique and localization applied in humans, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles and Gore-Tex\u00ae were implanted subcutaneously and additionally tested in a separate series as a chest-wall graft. After 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks cell infiltration into the respective materials, inflammatory reactions as well as neo-vascularization (endothelial cells) were determined in six different zones. While Gore-Tex\u00ae allowed for cell infiltration only at the outer surface, electrospun poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles were completely penetrated by infiltrating cells. These cells were composed mainly by macrophages, with only 4% of giant cells and lymphocytes. Total macrophage count increased by time while the number of IL1-\u03b2-expressing macrophages decreased, indicating a protective state towards the graft. As such, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles seem to develop ideal characteristics as a material for chest-wall replacement by (a) having the advantage of full biodegradation, (b) displaying stable chest-wall structures and (c) adapting a physiological and integrating graft compared to Gore-Tex\u00ae.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2013-12-03", "authors": ["WolfgangJungraithmayr", "IsabelleLaube", "NoraHild", "Wendelin JStark", "DanielaMihic-Probst", "WalterWeder", "JohannaBuschmann"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328213513621"}

In this study, we report that the modulation of the polymer concentration, the degree of acetylation, the gelation processes [or neutralization routes (NR)] in the preparation of different chitosan-based hydrogels lead to substantially and significantly different biological responses. We show that it is possible to tune the physicochemical characteristics, mechanical properties, and biological responses of such matrices. Physical hydrogels prepared from highly acetylated chitosan were softer, degraded quickly in vivo, and were not suitable for in vitro culture of human mesenchymal stem and progenitor derived endothelial cells. In contrast, for a same chitosan concentration and obtained by the same processing route, a low degree of acetylation chitosan hydrogel provided a more elastic material, better cell adhesion on its surface and tissue regeneration, and restored tissue neo-vascularization as well.

In the present study, we investigated whether this approach is affected by the cellular composition of the grafts. For this purpose, endometrial tissue fragments covered with luminal epithelium (LE(+)) and without luminal epithelium (LE(-)) were transplanted from transgenic green-fluorescent-protein-positive (GFP(+)) donor mice into the dorsal skinfold chamber of GFP(-) wild-type recipient animals to analyze their vascularization, growth and morphology by means of repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry during a 14-day observation period. LE(-) fragments developed into typical endometriosis-like lesions with cyst-like dilated endometrial glands and a well-vascularized endometrial stroma. In contrast, LE(+) fragments exhibited a polypoid morphology and a significantly reduced blood perfusion after engraftment, because the luminal epithelium prevented the vascular interconnection with the microvasculature of the surrounding host tissue. This was associated with a markedly decreased growth rate of LE(+) lesions compared with LE(-) lesions. In addition, we found that many GFP(+) microvessels grew outside the LE(-) lesions and developed interconnections to the host microvasculature, indicating that inosculation is an important mechanism in the vascularization process of endometriosis-like lesions. Our findings demonstrate that the luminal epithelium crucially affects the vascularization, growth and morphology of endometriosis-like lesions.

NP acts as an estrogenic compound and it is able to mimic the action of estradiol 17\u03b2 (E2) by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). The aim of the present study was to investigate the NP effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis of the bioindicator Podarcis sicula lizard. A time-dependent stimulation of the HPA axis and variations of both catecholamine plasma levels were showed. Moreover, NP effects on adrenal gland morphology were evaluated by light and transmission electron microscopy. Clear morphological signs of adrenal gland stimulation such as an increase of steroidogenic cord diameter and vascularization, a strong escalation of adrenaline cell number and a decrease of noradrenaline cells were observed. The notably elevated levels of adrenal hormones suggested a permanent turning on of hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) secretion together with a lack of the negative feedback of HPA axis, perturbing systemic responses of the organism.

The introduction of transducers with frequency of 10-17 MHz has improved the resolution of pediatric testes images as well as the resolution of the inguinal canals images, which has been of particular importance for the evaluation of undescended, retractile and abdominal testes. New diagnostic tools have also been introduced, such as 3D imaging or elastography, whose application has helped provide valuable additional information for the evaluation of pediatric testes, for treatment monitoring, and for post-surgical follow-up examinations. 3D imaging facilitates a more accurate evaluation of the location of an undescended testicle, testicular volume, and vascularization.

Next, techniques for quantifying bone blood flow are briefly summarized. Finally, the body of experimental work that demonstrates the role of bone blood flow in fracture healing, distraction osteogenesis, osteoporosis, disuse osteopenia, and bone grafting is examined.

We included original articles evaluating the performance of vaginal ultrasound in detecting acute PID.\nSeven articles were selected, including between 18 and 77 patients each. The golden standard used was laparoscopy/endometrial biopsy in six studies and mostly clinical evaluation in one. \"Thick tubal walls\" proved to be a specific and sensitive ultrasound sign of acute PID, provided that the walls of the tubes can be evaluated, i.e., when fluid is present in the tubal lumen (100\u00a0% sensitivity). The cogwheel sign is also a specific sign of PID (95-99\u00a0% specificity), but it seems to be less sensitive (0-86\u00a0% sensitivity). Bilateral adnexal masses appearing either as small solid masses or as cystic masses with thick walls and possibly manifesting the cogwheel sign also seems to be a reasonably reliable sign (82\u00a0% sensitivity, 83\u00a0%specificity). Doppler results overlap too much between women with and without acute PID for them to be useful in the diagnosis of acute PID, even though acutely inflamed tubes are richly vascularized at color Doppler.\nEven though the results of our review suggest that transvaginal ultrasound has limited ability to diagnose acute PID, it is likely to be helpful when managing women with symptoms of acute PID, because in some cases the typical ultrasound signs of acute PID can be detected.", "journal": "Archives of gynecology and obstetrics", "date": "2013-11-30", "authors": ["GRomosan", "LValentin"], "doi": "10.1007/s00404-013-3091-6"}

BMSCs were induced to corneal lineage using limbal medium for 10\u00a0days.

Limbal stem cell deficiency models were induced by alkaline injury, and the TEC was implanted for 8\u00a0weeks. Serial slit lamp evaluation revealed remarkable improvement in corneal regeneration in terms of corneal clarity and reduced vascularization. Histologic and optical coherence tomography analyses demonstrated comparable corneal thickness and achieved stratified epithelium with a compact stromal layer resembling that of normal cornea.

Half of the rabbits in each group underwent ischemic preconditioning. The osteomyocutaneous flaps consisted of the tibia bone, from which the overlying muscle and skin were raised. The technique of ischemic preconditioning involved applying a vascular clamp to the pedicle for 3 cycles of 10 minutes each. The rabbits then underwent serial plain radiography and computed tomography imaging on the first, second, fourth, and sixth postoperative weeks. Following this, all of the rabbits were sacrificed and histological examinations were performed.\nThe results showed that for clinical analysis of the skin flaps and bone grafts, the preconditioned groups showed better survivability. In the plain radiographs, except for two non-preconditioned rabbits with intraoperative ischemic times of 6 hours, all began to show early callus formation at the fourth week. The computed tomography findings showed more callus formation in the preconditioned groups for all of the ischemic times except for the 18-hour group. The histological findings correlated with the radiological findings.

{"title": "G-protein-coupled receptor 91 and succinate are key contributors in neonatal postcerebral hypoxia-ischemia recovery.", "abstract": "Prompt post-hypoxia-ischemia (HI) revascularization has been suggested to improve outcome in adults and newborn subjects. Other than hypoxia-inducible factor, sensors of metabolic demand remain largely unknown. During HI, anaerobic respiration is arrested resulting in accumulation of carbohydrate metabolic intermediates. As such succinate readily increases, exerting its biological effects via a specific receptor, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 91. We postulate that succinate/GPR91 enhances post-HI vascularization and reduces infarct size in a model of newborn HI brain injury.\nThe Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal HI was used. Succinate was measured by mass spectrometry, and microvascular density was evaluated by quantification of lectin-stained cryosection. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Succinate levels rapidly increased in the penumbral region of brain infarcts. GPR91 was foremost localized not only in neurons but also in astrocytes. Microvascular density increased at 96 hours after injury in wild-type animals; it was diminished in GPR91-null mice leading to an increased infarct size. Stimulation with succinate led to an increase in growth factors implicated in angiogenesis only in wild-type mice. To explain the mode of action of succinate/GPR91, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2-prostaglandin E receptor 4, previously proposed in neural angiogenesis. Succinate-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression was abrogated by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a selective prostaglandin E receptor 4 antagonist. This antagonist also abolished succinate-induced neovascularization.\nWe uncover a dominant metabolic sensor responsible for post-HI neurovascular adaptation, notably succinate/GPR91, acting via prostaglandin E2-prostaglandin E receptor 4 to govern expression of major angiogenic factors. We propose that pharmacological intervention targeting GPR91 could improve post-HI brain recovery.", "journal": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "date": "2013-11-29", "authors": ["DavidHamel", "MelanieSanchez", "Fran\u00e7oisDuhamel", "OlivierRoy", "Jean-ClaudeHonor\u00e9", "BaraaNoueihed", "TianweiZhou", "MathieuNadeau-Vall\u00e9e", "XinHou", "Jean-ClaudeLavoie", "GrantMitchell", "Orval AMamer", "SylvainChemtob"], "doi": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.113.302131"}

However, the overall therapeutic benefits are still uncertain, as the mortality remains high. Elevated expression of YKL-40 in GBM was correlated with increases in mural cell-associated vessel coverage, stability and density, and decreases in vessel permeability and disease survival. To explore the potential role of YKL-40 in mural cell-mediated tumor vascularization, we employed an anti-YKL-40 neutralizing antibody (mAY) and ionizing irradiation (IR) in xenografted brain tumor models. Although single treatment with mAY or IR partially increased mouse survival, their combination led to dramatic inhibition in tumor growth and increases in mouse survival. mAY blocked mural cell-mediated vascular stability, integrity and angiogenesis; whereas IR merely promoted tumor cell and vascular cell apoptosis. Vascular radioresistance is at least partially attributed to expression of YKL-40 in mural cells. These divergent effects were also recapitulated in cultured systems using endothelial cells and mural cells differentiated from glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). Dysfunction of intercellular contact N-cadherin was found to mediate mAY-inhibited vascularization.

Only partial absorption was noted (5.6 percent).\nThe chondrofat composite tissue was found to be a new innovative graft material in which neocartilage is regenerated to be continuous with fat tissue by means of the neoperichondrium.

However, certain immunologic challenges remain. In particular, although tolerance has been induced to nearly all components of a hand allograft in experimental models, the skin component may still be subject to acute rejection episodes. Currently, conventional immunosuppressive protocols have been successful at preventing allograft loss; however, they have not prevented episodes of acute skin rejection. Furthermore, the profound side effect profile of the life-long, high-dose, multidrug immunosuppression regimen that is necessary to maintain a viable graft alters the risk to benefit ratio of this non-life-saving procedure. Therefore, there must be a concerted effort in the scientific community to develop novel protocols to either minimize immunosuppression or to induce tolerance to the allograft to promote the widespread application of this life-changing procedure.", "journal": "Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["StefanSchneeberger", "SaamiKhalifian", "GeraldBrandacher"], "doi": "10.1097/BTH.0000000000000019"}

Others subsequently indicated that mutant p53 tumor cells undergo p53 degradation and cell death under aerobic glucose-free conditions. Since glucose starvation occurs in hypoxic gradients of poorly vascularized tumors, we investigated the role of p53 siRNA under hypoxia in wt p53 C8161 melanoma using glucose starvation or 5mM physiological glucose. p53 Silencing decreased survival of glucose-starved C8161 melanoma with pyruvate supplementation under hypoxia (\u22641% oxygen), but increased resistance to glycolytic inhibitors oxamate and 2-deoxyglucose in 5mM glucose, preferentially under normoxia. Aiming to counteract hypoxic tumor cell survival irrespective of p53 status, genetically-matched human C8161 melanoma harboring wt p53 or mutant p53 (R175H) were used combining true hypoxia (\u22641% oxygen) and hypoxia mimetic CoCl2. No significant decrease in metabolic activity was evidenced in C8161 melanoma irrespective of p53 status in 2.5mM glucose after 48h of physical hypoxia. However, combining the latter with 100\u03bcM CoCl2 was preferentially toxic for mutant p53 C8161 melanoma, and was enhanced by catalase in wt p53 C8161 cells. Downregulation of MnSOD and LDHA accompanied the toxicity induced by hypoxia and CoCl2 in 5mM glucose, and these changes were enhanced by oxamate or 2-deoxyglucose.

{"title": "Scaphoid overstuffing: the effects of the dimensions of scaphoid reconstruction on scapholunate alignment.", "abstract": "Osteochondral replacement of the proximal scaphoid has been reported using a vascularized flap from the medial femoral trochlea. A concern with this technique is the loss of stability of the scapholunate relationship with resection of the scaphoid proximal pole. Overexpansion of the scaphoid dimensions (overstuffing) during scaphoid reconstruction with the osteochondral flap may play a role in maintaining scapholunate alignment. Our purpose was to determine if overstuffing the scaphoid can correct rotatory carpal instability in a cadaveric model studied radiographically.\nThe radiolunate angle and scapholunate interval were measured for 5 fresh cadaver wrists. We completely incised the scapholunate interosseous ligament and performed an osteotomy to excise the proximal third of the scaphoid to simulate a proximal pole deficiency nonunion and create a dorsal intercalated segmental instability deformity. Radiographic measurements were repeated. The proximal pole of the scaphoid was replaced with its original piece of bone; radiographic measurements were repeated without scapholunate ligament repair. The osteotomy site was overstuffed with a 4-mm sawbone spacer without scapholunate ligament repair, and radiographs were obtained.\nSectioning of scapholunate ligaments and proximal pole excision successfully created carpal instability demonstrated by abnormal radiolunate angles. Without ligament repair, proximal pole replacement did not restore normal radiolunate angles. Expansion of the scaphoid dimensions corrected radiolunate angles on lateral unloaded radiographs and improved scapholunate intervals on clenched fist radiographs. These findings were statistically significant compared with the unexpanded (replaced) scaphoid.\nThese findings suggest that scaphoid reconstruction that results in expansion of the scaphoid's normal dimensions will restore carpal alignment without scapholunate ligament reconstruction.\nOsteochondral reconstruction of difficult proximal pole nonunions may not require any preservation or reconstruction of scapholunate integrity if the reconstruction expands the normal dimensions of the native scaphoid. Scapholunate interval and carpal alignment may be restored by scaphoid over stuffing. The effects on increased contact pressure and range of motion require further investigation.", "journal": "The Journal of hand surgery", "date": "2013-11-28", "authors": ["Anthony ECapito", "James PHiggins"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jhsa.2013.09.035"}
{"title": "Anti-angiogenic activities of two recombinant disintegrins derived from the Mohave and Prairie rattlesnakes.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the growth and spread of cancer. New vascularization nourishes cancer cells with oxygen and nutrients, allowing these cells to grow, invade nearby tissue, spread to other parts of the body, and form new colonies of cancer cells. Tumor angiogenesis consists of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation into the tumor mass. The study of natural and synthetic angiogenesis inhibitors is a promising area for therapeutics since tumors cannot grow or spread without the formation of new blood vessels. Anti-angiogenic activities have been identified in peptides known as disintegrins. Disintegrins are a family of small proteins (45-84 amino acids in length), many which are found in snake venom that function as potent inhibitors of both platelet aggregation and integrin-dependent cell adhesion. This study reports two recombinant disintegrins (r-mojastin 1 and r-viridistatin 2) inhibiting, with similar effectiveness, distinct steps in angiogenesis such as proliferation, adhesion to fibronectin, migration, and tube formation in vitro and in vivo. Both recombinant disintegrins bind to \u03b1(v)\u03b2\u2083 and \u03b1(v)\u03b2\u2085 receptors that are upregulated in tumor endothelial cells, having a higher binding activity to \u03b1(v)\u03b2\u2083 integrin.", "journal": "Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology", "date": "2013-11-26", "authors": ["Sara ELucena", "KarenRomo", "MontamasSuntravat", "Elda ES\u00e1nchez"], "doi": "10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.005"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the bone volume stability of vascularized bone grafts, particularly in the early highly resorptive phase, from the iliac crest (DCIA) and the fibula and to assess the implantologic rehabilitations.\nThirty-six patients with mandibular continuity defects due to tumor resection were reconstructed by the use of vascularized bone grafts; 21 patients received DCIA flaps and 15 patients received a composite free fibular flap, depending on the size and location of the defect. Bone resorption was assessed using digital panographs. Radiographs were taken immediately after bone reconstruction, 6 months postoperatively, prior to implant surgery, and at prosthetic loading.\nAfter a mean observation period of 6 months, vertical bone resorption was 6.79% for the patients of the iliac crest group (DCIA), 10.20% after 11 months, and 12.58% after 17 months. Fibular grafts showed a bone resorption of 5.30% after a mean observation time of 6 months, 8.26% after 11 months, and 16.95% after 17 months.

The HAp scaffold was coated with a poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) using vacuum impregnation technique. The compositional and morphological properties of HAp and PCL-coated HAp scaffolds were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Bioactivity was tested by immersion in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and mechanical tests were performed at compression. The results showed that PCL-coated HAp (HAp/PCL) scaffold resulted in a material with improved mechanical properties that keep the original interconnected porous structure indispensable for tissue growth and vascularization. The compressive strength (0.88MPa) and the elastic modulus (15.5MPa) are within the lower range of properties reported for human trabecular bones.

To elucidate mechanisms through which NCM directs skeletal development and evolution, we made chimeras from quail and duck embryos, which differ markedly in their craniofacial morphology and maturation rates. We show that quail NCM, when transplanted into duck, maintains its faster timetable for development and autonomously executes molecular and cellular programs for the induction, differentiation, and mineralization of bone, including premature expression of osteogenic genes such as Runx2 and Col1a1. In contrast, the duck host systemic environment appears to be relatively permissive and supports osteogenesis independently by providing circulating minerals and a vascular network. Further experiments reveal that NCM establishes the timing of osteogenesis by regulating cell cycle progression in a stage- and species-specific manner. Altering the time-course of D-type cyclin expression mimics chimeras by accelerating expression of Runx2 and Col1a1. We also discover higher endogenous expression of Runx2 in quail coincident with their smaller craniofacial skeletons, and by prematurely over-expressing Runx2 in chick embryos we reduce the overall size of the craniofacial skeleton. Thus, our work indicates that NCM establishes species-specific size in the craniofacial skeleton by controlling cell cycle, Runx2 expression, and the timing of key events during osteogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2013-11-23", "authors": ["JaneHall", "Andrew HJheon", "Erin LEalba", "B FrankEames", "Kristin DButcher", "Siu-ShanMak", "RajLadher", "TamaraAlliston", "Richard ASchneider"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.11.011"}
{"title": "Vascularisation is not necessary for gut colonisation by enteric neural crest cells.", "abstract": "The vasculature and nervous system share striking similarities in their networked, tree-like architecture and in the way they are super-imposed in mature organs. It has previously been suggested that the intestinal microvasculature network directs the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCC) along the gut to promote the formation of the enteric nervous system (ENS). To investigate the inter-relationship of migrating ENCC, ENS formation and gut vascular development we combined fate-mapping of ENCC with immunolabelling and intravascular dye injection to visualise nascent blood vessel networks. We found that the enteric and vascular networks initially had very distinct patterns of development. In the foregut, ENCC migrated through areas devoid of established vascular networks. In vessel-rich areas, such as the midgut and hindgut, the distribution of migrating ENCC did not support the idea that these cells followed a pre-established vascular network. Moreover, when gut vascular development was impaired, either genetically in Vegfa(120/120) or Tie2-Cre;Nrp1(fl/-) mice or using an in vitro Wnt1-Cre;Rosa26(Yfp/+) mouse model of ENS development, ENCC still colonised the entire length of the gut, including the terminal hindgut. These results demonstrate that blood vessel networks are not necessary to guide migrating ENCC during ENS development. Conversely, in miRet(51) mice, which lack ENS in the hindgut, the vascular network in this region appeared to be normal suggesting that in early development both networks form independently of each other.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2013-11-23", "authors": ["Jean-MarieDelalande", "DipaNatarajan", "BertrandVernay", "MalcolmFinlay", "ChristianaRuhrberg", "NikhilThapar", "Alan JBurns"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.11.007"}

We hypothesize that engineering a highly vascularized collagen-based construct will allow islet graft survival and function in alternative sites. In this study, we developed such a collagen-based biomaterial. Neonatal porcine islets (NPIs) were embedded in collagen matrices crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide containing combinations of chondroitin-6-sulfate, chitosan, and laminin, and compared with controls cultured in standard media. Islets were examined for insulin secretory activity after 24 h and 4 d and for apoptotic cell death and matrix integrity after 7 d in vitro. These same NPI/collagen constructs were transplanted subcutaneously in immunoincompetent B6.Rag-/- mice and then assessed for islet survival and vascularization. At all time points assessed during in vitro culture there were no significant differences in insulin secretory activity between control islets and those embedded in the collagen constructs, indicating that the collagen matrix had no adverse effect on islet function. Less cell death was observed in the matrix with all co-polymers compared with the other matrices tested. Immunohistochemical analysis of the grafts post-transplant confirmed the presence of intact insulin-positive islets; grafts were also shown to be vascularized by von Willebrand factor staining.

{"title": "Molecular phenotypes in triple negative breast cancer from African American patients suggest targets for therapy.", "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by high proliferation, poor differentiation and a poor prognosis due to high rates of recurrence. Despite lower overall incidence African American (AA) patients suffer from higher breast cancer mortality in part due to the higher proportion of TNBC cases among AA patients compared to European Americans (EA). It was recently shown that the clinical heterogeneity of TNBC is reflected by distinct transcriptional programs with distinct drug response profiles in preclinical models. In this study, gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry were used to elucidate potential differences between TNBC tumors of EA and AA patients on a molecular level. In a retrospective cohort of 136 TNBC patients, a major transcriptional signature of proliferation was found to be significantly upregulated in samples of AA ethnicity. Furthermore, transcriptional profiles of AA tumors showed differential activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and a signature of BRCA1 deficiency in this cohort. Using signatures derived from the meta-analysis of TNBC gene expression carried out by Lehmann et al., tumors from AA patients were more likely of basal-like subtypes whereas transcriptional features of many EA samples corresponded to mesenchymal-like or luminal androgen receptor driven subtypes. These results were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas mRNA and protein expression data, again showing enrichment of a basal-like phenotype in AA tumors and mesenchymal subtypes in EA tumors.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is a switch molecule controlling HSC activation. We investigated PPAR\u03b3 regulation of angiogenic signal transduction and the molecular mechanisms involved in HSCs. Primary rat HSCs and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) were isolated and used in this study. Boyden chamber and tubulogenesis assays, identified that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-RhoA signaling activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was required for HSC motility and the associated vascularization. PDGF also stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and HSC-driven vascularization through signals mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b3 interrupted FAK-RhoA, ERK and mTOR cascades and inhibited HSC-based vascularization. Molecular evidence further revealed that PPAR\u03b3 attenuation of HSC angiogenic properties was dependent on inhibition of PDGF-\u03b2 receptor expression. We concluded that PPAR\u03b3 inhibited angiogenic signal transduction through transrepression of PDGF-\u03b2 receptor leading to reduced HSC motility, reduced VEGF expression, and thereby attenuated HSC-driven angiogenesis. PPAR\u03b3 could be a molecular target for preventing vascular remolding in hepatic fibrosis.", "journal": "Journal of cell science", "date": "2013-11-22", "authors": ["FengZhang", "DesongKong", "LiChen", "XiaopingZhang", "NaqiLian", "XiaojingZhu", "YinLu", "ShizhongZheng"], "doi": "10.1242/jcs.128306"}
{"title": "A novel and essential role for Fc\u03b3RIIa in cancer cell-induced platelet activation.", "abstract": "Platelets play a role in cancer by acting as a dynamic reservoir of effectors that facilitate tumor vascularization, growth, and metastasis. However, little information is available about the mechanism of tumor cell-induced platelet secretion (TCIPS) or the molecular machinery by which effector molecules are released from platelets. Here we demonstrate that tumor cells directly induce platelet secretion. Preincubation of platelets with human colon cancer (Caco-2), prostate cancer (PC3M-luc), or breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231;MCF-7) resulted in a marked dose-dependent secretion of dense granules. Importantly, TCIPS preceded aggregation which always displayed a characteristic lag time. We investigated the role of platelet receptors and downstream molecules in TCIPS. The most potent modulators of TCIPS were the pharmacologic antagonists of Syk kinase, phospholipase C and protein kinase C, all downstream mediators of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) cascade in platelets. Supporting this, we demonstrated a central role for the immune Fc\u03b3 receptor IIa (Fc\u03b3RIIa) in mediating platelet-tumor cell cross-talk. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cancer cells can promote platelet dense-granule secretion, which is required to augment platelet aggregation.

Despite significant effort, the generation of high-fidelity adult-like human cardiac tissue analogs remains challenging. We used computational modeling of tissue contraction and assembly mechanics in conjunction with microfabricated constraints to guide the design of aligned and functional 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiac microtissues that we term cardiac microwires (CMWs). Miniaturization of the platform circumvented the need for tissue vascularization and enabled higher-throughput image-based analysis of CMW drug responsiveness. CMW tissue properties could be tuned using electromechanical stimuli and cell composition. Specifically, controlling self-assembly of 3D tissues in aligned collagen, and pacing with point stimulation electrodes, were found to promote cardiac maturation-associated gene expression and in vivo-like electrical signal propagation. Furthermore, screening a range of hPSC-derived cardiac cell ratios identified that 75% NKX2 Homeobox 5 (NKX2-5)+ cardiomyocytes and 25% Cluster of Differentiation 90 OR (CD90)+ nonmyocytes optimized tissue remodeling dynamics and yielded enhanced structural and functional properties. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the optimized platform in a tachycardic model of arrhythmogenesis, an aspect of cardiac electrophysiology not previously recapitulated in 3D in vitro hPSC-derived cardiac microtissue models.

One class of materials that improves FBR outcomes is made by sphere-templating, resulting in porous structures with uniform, interconnected 34\u00a0\u03bcm pores. With these materials we observe reduced fibrosis and increased vascularization. We hypothesized that improved healing is a result of a shift in macrophage polarization, often measured as the ratio of M1 pro-inflammatory cells to M2 pro-healing cells. In this study, macrophage polarity of 34\u00a0\u03bcm porous implants was compared to non-porous and 160\u00a0\u03bcm porous implants in subcutaneous mouse tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed that macrophages in implant pores displayed a shift towards an M1 phenotype compared to externalized cells. Macrophages in 34\u00a0\u03bcm porous implants had up to 63% greater expression of M1 markers and up to 85% reduction in M2 marker expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

One of the molecular hallmarks of triple-negative breast cancers is increased expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are implicated in many critical aspects of cancer progression including metabolism, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and stem cell maintenance. Ganetespib is a second-generation inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone that is essential for the stability and function of multiple client proteins in cancer cells including HIF-1\u03b1. In this study, human MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 triple-negative breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice that received weekly intravenous injections of ganetespib or vehicle following the development of palpable tumors. Ganetespib treatment markedly impaired primary tumor growth and vascularization, and eliminated local tissue invasion and distant metastasis to regional lymph nodes and lungs. Ganetespib treatment also significantly reduced the number of Aldefluor-positive cancer stem cells in the primary tumor. Primary tumors of ganetespib-treated mice had significantly reduced levels of HIF-1\u03b1 (but not HIF-2\u03b1) protein and of HIF-1 target gene mRNAs encoding proteins that play key roles in angiogenesis, metabolism, invasion, and metastasis, thereby providing a molecular basis for observed effects of the drug on the growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer.\nTriple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) respond poorly to available chemotherapy.

{"title": "Structure and growth pattern of pseudoteeth in Pelagornis mauretanicus (Aves, Odontopterygiformes, Pelagornithidae).", "abstract": "The extinct Odontopterygiformes are the sole birds known to possess strong and sharp bony pseudoteeth, the shape and location of which are closely mimetic of real teeth. The structure of the pseudoteeth is investigated here in a late Pliocene/early Pleistocene species, Pelagornis mauretanicus, using X-ray microtomography and thin sections. The results are interpreted with regard to the pseudotooth mode of growth, and have implications concerning aspects of Pelagornis ecology. The larger pseudoteeth are hollow and approximately cone-shaped, and the smaller ones are rostro-caudally constricted. The walls of pseudoteeth are composed of bone tissue of the fibro-lamellar type, which is intensively remodeled by Haversian substitution. The jaw bones display the same structure as the pseudoteeth, but their vascular canals are oriented parallel to the long axis of the bones, whereas they are perpendicular to this direction in the pseudoteeth. There is no hiatus or evidence of a fusion between the pseudoteeth and the jaw bones. Two possible models for pseudotooth growth are derived from the histological data. The most plausible model is that pseudotooth growth began after the completion of jaw bone growth, as a simple local protraction of periosteal osteogenic activity. Pseudotooth development thus occurred relatively late during ontogeny. The highly vascularized structure and the relative abundance of parallel-fibered bone tissue in the pseudoteeth suggest poor mechanical capabilities. The pseudoteeth were most likely covered and protected by the hardened, keratinized rhamphotheca in the adult during life.

{"title": "Predictive markers of efficacy for an angiopoietin-2 targeting therapeutic in xenograft models.", "abstract": "The clinical efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapies has been difficult to predict, and biomarkers that can predict responsiveness are sorely needed in this era of personalized medicine. CVX-060 is an angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) targeting therapeutic, consisting of two peptides that bind Ang2 with high affinity and specificity, covalently fused to a scaffold antibody. In order to optimize the use of this compound in the clinic the construction of a predictive model is described, based on the efficacy of CVX-060 in 13 cell line and 2 patient-derived xenograft models. Pretreatment size tumors from each of the models were profiled for the levels of 27 protein markers of angiogenesis, SNP haplotype in 5 angiogenesis genes, and somatic mutation status for 11 genes implicated in tumor growth and/or vascularization. CVX-060 efficacy was determined as tumor growth inhibition (TGI%) at termination of each study. A predictive statistical model was constructed based on the correlation of these efficacy data with the marker profiles, and the model was subsequently tested by prospective analysis in 11 additional models. The results reveal a range of CVX-060 efficacy in xenograft models of diverse tissue types (0-64% TGI, median = 27%) and define a subset of 3 proteins (Ang1, EGF, Emmprin), the levels of which may be predictive of TGI by Ang2 blockade. The direction of the associations is such that better efficacy correlates with high levels of target and low levels of compensatory/antagonizing molecules. This effort has revealed a set of candidate predictive markers for CVX-060 efficacy that will be further evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-11-19", "authors": ["GallenTriana-Baltzer", "AdamPavlicek", "AriadneGoulart", "HanhuaHuang", "StevenPirie-Shepherd", "NancyLevin"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0080132\n10.1016/j.canlet.2012.03.008\n10.1097/PPO.0b013e318212db3c\n10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70232-1\n10.2174/1566524033479465\n10.1007/s00441-003-0749-6\n10.1038/nrc2894\n10.1172/JCI58832\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.07.001\n10.1074/jbc.M100282200\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81812-7\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.107.161521\n10.1038/74725\n10.1038/ncb1715\n10.1038/ncb1714\n10.1126/science.277.5322.55\n10.1128/MCB.01472-08\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.01.018\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203800\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2317\n10.1007/978-1-4757-3401-0_24\n10.1016/j.juro.2008.05.015\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0120\n10.1073/pnas.0915033107\n10.1002/gcc.10028\n10.1038/nm.1877\n10.1002/ijc.21496\n10.1038/onc.2010.89\n10.1200/JCO.2008.16.1612\n10.1200/JCO.2010.32.9110\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1016/j.canlet.2010.06.011\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2602\n10.1200/JCO.2009.22.4279\n10.1016/j.canlet.2008.09.033\n10.1097/01.cco.0000228737.78003.06\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0416\n10.1200/JCO.2005.02.477\n10.1002/jcp.21260\n10.1182/blood-2009-04-217380\n10.1080/07357900802392675\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0809"}

The type of biomaterial influences EPC function with bioglass evoking a vascularizing response. In this study the influence of a composite biomaterial based on polylactic acid (PLA) and either 20 or 40% bioglass, BG20 and BG40, respectively, on the differentiation and survival of EPCs in vitro was investigated. Subsequently, the effect of the composite material on early vascularization in a rat calvarial critical size defect model with or without EPCs was evaluated. Human EPCs were cultured with \u03b2-TCP, PLA, BG20 or BG40, and seeding efficacy, cell viability, cell morphology and apoptosis were analysed in vitro. BG40 released the most calcium, and improved endothelial differentiation and vitality best. This effect was mimicked by adding an equivalent amount of calcium to the medium and was diminished in the presence of the calcium chelator, EGTA. To analyze the effect of BG40 and EPCs in vivo, a 6-mm diameter critical size calvarial defect was created in rats (n\u200a=\u200a12). Controls (n\u200a=\u200a6) received BG40 and the treatment group (n\u200a=\u200a6) received BG40 seeded with 5\u00d710(5) rat EPCs. Vascularization after 1 week was significantly improved when EPCs were seeded onto BG40, compared to implanting BG40 alone.

T11 target structure (T11TS), a bioactive molecule, has been documented as an anti-neoplastic agent in glioma-induced rats and also in human glioma in vitro. This novel molecule induces apoptosis of tumor cells by way of immune potentiation and impairs the glioma cell cycle, but its role in glioma angiogenesis has not been worked out in detail. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes promoting tumor angiogenesis by enzymatically remodeling the extracellular matrix and altering surface protein expression such as integrin \u03b1v and the matrix-bound proteins like TGF-\u03b21. The present study was formulated to assess the efficacy of T11TS in the modulations of MMP-2 and -9 and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) as well as modulations of integrin \u03b1v and TGF-\u03b21 in glioma-induced rats and also on the phenotypic markers of endothelial cells (CD31 and CD34). The parameters used were zymography, western blot, and flow cytometric analyses. It was observed that T11TS administration significantly downregulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 along with its ligand integrin \u03b1v and upregulates TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. In situ immunofluorescence and FACS results revealed that T11TS administration decreased the expression of the phenotypic markers (CD31/PECAM1, CD34), inhibiting the cell grip and also downregulating TGF-\u03b21 expression (ELISA) from microglia cells in the glioma microenvironment. These results suggest that T11TS suppresses the expression of positive angiogenic growth factors and potentiates the expression of negative regulators in glioma-associated endothelial cells (ECs), resulting in an anti-angiogenic effect on glioma-induced angiogenesis.", "journal": "Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine", "date": "2013-11-19", "authors": ["Manoj KumarSingh", "DebanjanBhattacharya", "SuhnritaChaudhuri", "SagarAcharya", "PankajKumar", "PranjalSantra", "Anjan KumarBasu", "SwapnaChaudhuri"], "doi": "10.1007/s13277-013-1296-8"}

However, previous studies involving DAT-derived scaffolds have not fully revealed their potentials for in vivo adipose tissue construction. With the aim of developing a more efficient adipose tissue engineering technique based on DAT, in this study, we investigated the in vivo adipogenic potential of a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) delivery system based on heparinized DAT (Hep-DAT). To generate this system, heparins were cross-linked to mouse DATs by using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide and N-Hydroxysuccinimide. The bFGF-binding Hep-DATs were first tested for controlled release ability in vitro and then transplanted subcutaneously. Highly vascularized adipose tissues were formed 6weeks after transplantation. Histology and gene expression analysis revealed that majority of the Hep-DAT scaffolds were infiltrated with host-derived adipose tissues that possessed similar adipogenic and inflammatory gene expression as endogenous adipose tissues. Additionally, strong de novo adipogenesis could also be induced when bFGF-binding Hep-DATs were thoroughly minced and injected subcutaneously. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that bFGF-binding Hep-DAT could be an efficient, biocompatible and injectable adipogenic system for in vivo adipose tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2013-11-19", "authors": ["QiqiLu", "MingmingLi", "YuZou", "TongCao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.11.007"}

In vitro studies indicated that NTTTH homologs could especially target inflamed vascular endothelial cells, as imaging quantitative analysis indicated that the mean of integrated optical density (MIOD) and mean of stained area (MSA) were significantly higher versus control (P<0.05). In vivo studies showed that, after intravenous injection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled NTTTH homologs into the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed mice for 30min, NTTTH homologs were distributed in highly vascularized and inflamed organs like liver and kidney. As a control, little fluorescence could be detected in mice injected with EGFP alone. Cryosection showed that NTTTH homologs especially targeted inflamed vasculatures but not normal ones. We did not detect fluorescence signal in either normal or inflamed mice which were injected with EGFP alone.

Inadequate trophoblast invasion and vascular dysfunction are believed to be involved in preeclampsia. Axl, which interacts with its ligand Gas6, known to regulate cell migration, adhesion, and vascular angiogenesis or homeostasis and vascular network formation, may be implicated in preeclampsia, as preeclampsia is a specific vascular disease. sAxl, a soluble form of Axl, is bound to Gas6 in plasma, which inhibits the activation of the Axl-Gas6 pathway. The aim of this study was to determine the changes and significance of plasma concentrations of sAxl in severe preeclampsia, as well as its correlation with the clinical parameters of severe preeclampsia.\nFifty-eight women with severe preeclampsia and 31 healthy pregnant women were included in the study, from April 2012 to October 2012.

In addition, it is now accepted that cancers can arise from and be maintained by the cancer stem cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC), commonly expanded in vitro as tumorspheres from several solid tumors, including melanoma (melanospheres). Here, we investigated the potential targeting of MEK pathway by exploiting highly reliable in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical models of melanomas based on melanospheres, as melanoma initiating cells (MIC) surrogates. MEK inhibition, through PD0325901, provided a successful strategy to affect survival of mutated-BRAF melanospheres and growth of wild type-BRAF melanospheres.

Currently, there are few experimental small animal models of vascularized lymph node transplantation. In this article, our aim was to describe a new vascularized cervical lymph node transplantation model in rats.\nTen male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 250 g were used in this study. The anatomic features of the neck lymph nodes in rats were explored. Anatomic neck dissections were performed, and lymph node flaps were harvested. The common carotid artery and the jugular vein were used as the vascular pedicles of the lymph node flap. Methylene blue dye was injected into the arterial pedicle. Lymph nodes were identified, and their structure was confirmed by histological evaluation. Laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography was used to confirm perfusion of the lymph node flap.\nAn adequate perfusion was observed in the lymph node flap. The dye disseminated evenly within the lymph nodes, indicating that the flap had a well-established vascular network and an adequate blood supply. Macroscopically, perfusion of 5 to 6 lymph nodes was observed. Histological examination of tissue samples confirmed well-defined lymph nodes. After indocyanine green administration, fluorescence was observed throughout the lymph node flap and within the venous pedicle of the flap.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing vascularized lymph node flap in the head and neck region of a rat.

However, with the progress of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), the disc tends to be vascularized increasingly via angiogenesis. It is well established that both human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and vascular endothelial cells express FasL and Fas. However, the issue remains open as to whether there are certain active mechanisms preventing angiogenesis in the disc via the FasL-Fas machinery. Here, we established a co-culture system of human NP cells and vascular endothelial (HMEC-1) cells. We found that normal NP cells were more capable of inducing apoptosis in HMEC-1 cells (14.2\u00b13.4%) than degenerate NP cells (6.7\u00b11.9%), p<0.05. By up-regulating the FasL expression in degenerate NP cells, we found that FasL played an essential role in the mediation of HMEC-1 cell apoptosis with the activation of downstream FADD and caspase-3. Furthermore, we found an increased Fas expression in HMEC-1 cells following co-cultured with NP cells, which might be closely linked with FasL produced by NP cells and enhance their interaction. Collectively, this is the first study showing FasL-Fas network might plays an important role in the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis avoidance of human disc.

{"title": "[Mesenchymal stroma cells and their niche].", "abstract": "Stem cells reside in a highly specialized, complex microenvironment that is known as the stem cell niche. The stem cell niche can be described as an anatomically defined space where the stem cell is localized and nourished and stem cell quiescence, proliferation and differentiation are maintained. Tissue engineering aims to imitate the stem cell niche to (I) induce a directed differentiation, (II) maintain the self-renewal capacity or (III) find a regulated balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSC) can differentiate in three-dimensional collagen gels into functional osteoblasts when subjected to a phosphate-rich cultivation medium. Furthermore, they acquire a prosynthetic, matrix remodeling, contractile phenotype. Medial artery calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease also proceeds through intramembranous ossification resulting from osteoblast-induced calcification of the collagen extracellular matrix. Thus, the influence of uremic cultivation conditions as a pathophysiological stimulus on MSC and endothelial cells was analyzed with special regards to matrix remodeling, vascularization and calcification. The results showed that BMP-2/4 mediated MSC (mal)differentiation into osteoblasts with acquired matrix remodeling phenotype and loss of proangiogenic capacity. These studies have led to the conclusion that uremia has detrimental effects on the stem cell niche and promotes the continuous calcification by osteogenic (mal)differentiation. In summary, recent studies have shown the conducting and regulating effect of the stem cell niche under physiological conditions that can be applied and mimicked for tissue engineering applications. However, under pathological conditions the stem cell niche can have detrimental effects on stem cell function and can promote disease progression.", "journal": "Der Pathologe", "date": "2013-11-15", "authors": ["R KSchneider"], "doi": "10.1007/s00292-013-1818-6"}

Here, we report on a new approach for enhanced EC transplantation using targeted nanoparticle transfection to deliver proangiogenic microRNA-132 (miR-132) to cultured ECs before their transplantation, thereby sensitizing cells to the effects of endogenous growth factors. We synthesized biodegradable PLGA polymer nanoparticles (NPs) that were loaded with miR-132 and coated with cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptides that target integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expressed on cultured human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs), increasing NP uptake through clathrin-coated pits. Unlike previously reported NPs for miR delivery, these NPs slowly release RNA for several weeks. The endocytosed NPs remain in clathrin-coated vesicles from which they mediate intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA. Transfection of HUVECs with miR-132 enhances growth factor-induced proliferation and migration in 2D culture, producing a 1.8- and 5-fold increase, respectively. However, while the effects of conventional transfection were short-lived, NP transfection produced protein knockdown and biological effects that were significantly longer in duration (\u2265 6 d). Transfection of HUVECs with miR-132 NP resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of microvessels per square millimeter compared to lipid after transplantation into immunodeficient mice and led to a higher number of mural cell-invested vessels than control transfection.

{"title": "Antitumor effects of recombinant antivascular protein ABRaA-VEGF121 combined with IL-12 gene therapy.", "abstract": "Development and neoplastic progression strongly rely on tumor microenvironment cells. Various kinds of cells that form such tumor milieu play substantial roles in angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Attempts to inhibit tumor vascularization alter tumor milieu and enhance immune response against the tumor. Anticancer therapeutic strategy bringing together antiangiogenic and immunostimulating agents has emerged as a promising approach. We here investigated whether therapy directed against preexisting vessels, combined with an immunomodulatory factor would be equally effective in arresting tumor growth. To this goal, we investigated the effectiveness of ABRaA-vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 121 (VEGF121), an antivascular drug constructed by us. It is a fusion protein composed of VEGF121, and abrin A chain (translation-inhibiting toxin). We used it in combination with interleukin (IL-12) gene therapy and tried to inhibit B16-F10 melanoma tumor growth. ABRaA-VEGF121 is a chimeric recombinant protein capable of destroying tumor vasculature and triggering necrosis in the vicinity of damaged vessels. IL-12 cytokine, in turn, activates both specific and non-specific immune responses. Our results demonstrate that combination of ABRaA-VEGF121 antivascular agent with immunostimulatory cytokine IL-12 indeed inhibits tumor growth more effectively than either agent alone, leading to complete cure of ca. 20\u00a0% mice. Post-therapeutic analysis of tumors excised from mice treated with combination therapy showed decreased numbers of blood microvessels in the tumor microenvironment, lowered numbers of regulatory T lymphocytes, as well as showed higher levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) as compared to control mice.

However, its major drawback is that it requires a 2-stage procedure to restore an adequate nasal cheek groove (Karsidag et al. J Craniofac Surg. 2010;21:1887-1889). In the perforator flaps, there are numerous studies that describe flaps whose vascular supply depend on perforators from the fascial artery.We planned to harvest a perforator flap around the medial cheek area, which included one cutaneous perforator from the facial artery. Free-style facial artery perforator flaps and auricular conchal cartilage framework were performed in 9 patients who have alar defect due to malignancies.From September 2010 to December 2011, the free-style facial perforator artery flap was performed in 9 patients at the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department of the Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, Turkey. The whole flap was used to reconstruct the whole alar unit, which includes cartilaginous tissues.Our aim is to define a one-stage reconstruction technique with a perforator-based flap. Our flap is supplied by a perforating branch of the facial artery. We develop this method because of its reliable vascularization, that is, the possibility of performing one-stage technique with sensation preservation.In conclusion, we strongly recommend one-stage reconstruction in any kind of alar region defect with this versatile facial perforator flap.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2013-11-14", "authors": ["SerdarDuzgun", "ErkinUnlu", "YagmurBali"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e3182a1498b"}

Allogenic bones can be an alternative with no donor area morbidity and unlimited amount of tissue. Better results can be achieved after allogenic bone preparation and adding a vascular supply, which can be done along with flap prefabrication. The purpose of this study was to evaluate demineralized/lyophilized and deep-frozen allogenic bones used for flap prefabrication and the tissue expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in these bone fragments.\nFifty-six Wistar rat bone diaphyses were prepared and distributed in 4 groups: demineralized/lyophilized (experimental group 1 and control group 2) and deep freezing (experimental group 3 and control group 4). Two bone segments (one of each group) were implanted in rats to prefabricate flaps using superficial epigastric vessels (experimental groups) or only transferred as grafts (control groups). These fragments remained in their respective inguinal regions until the death that occurred at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the operation. Semiquantitative histologic (tetracycline marking, cortical resorption, number of giant cells, and vascularization) and histomorphometrical quantitative (osteoid thickness, cortical thickness, and fibrosis thickness) analyses were performed. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 immunohistochemistry staining was also performed.\nGroup 1 fragments presented an osteoid matrix on their external surface in all periods. Cartilage formation and mineralization areas were also noticed. These findings were not observed in group 3 fragments. Group 1 had more mineralization and double tetracycline marks, which were almost not seen in group 3. Cortical resorption and the number of giant cells were greater in group 3 in all periods. Vascularization and fibrosis thickness were similar in both experimental groups. Group 1 had more intense TGF-\u03b2 staining within 2 weeks of study.

{"title": "Progesterone exposure of seasonally anoestrous ewes alters the expression of angiogenic growth factors in preovulatory follicles.", "abstract": "Small-dose, multiple injections of GnRH given to seasonally anoestrous ewes induce final stages of the preovulatory follicle development, but result in an high incidence of defective CL unless animals are primed with progesterone, which completely eliminates luteal dysfunction. Progesterone priming upregulates luteal vascularization; however, its effect on follicular angiogenesis is poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that progesterone priming of seasonally anoestrous ewes treated with dose multiple injections of GnRH eliminates defective luteal function by altering the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2, angiopoietin (ANG)-1, ANG-2, and TIE-2 during early and late preovulatory follicle development. Ten seasonally anoestrous ewes were given 20 mg of progesterone im 3 days before the start of GnRH treatment; 10 other animals served as controls. Intravenous injections of 500 ng GnRH were given to all animals every 2 hours for 28 hours, followed at 30 hours with a 300-\u03bcg GnRH bolus injection to synchronize the preovulatory LH surge. Ovaries were collected at 24 and 46 hours after the start of GnRH treatment. Small (2-2.5 mm) and large (>2.5 mm) follicles were analyzed for protein and mRNA expression of the angiogenic factors using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays. Progesterone priming did not have an influence on angiogenic factor levels in small follicles. However, progesterone-primed animals showed significantly (P \u2264 0.05) higher levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, ANG-1, and ANG-2 in large follicles compared with nonprimed ones. These data suggest that progesterone priming alters the expression of angiogenic factors in large preovulatory follicles, ensuring adequate luteal development and function.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2013-11-14", "authors": ["A C MChristensen", "WHaresign", "MKhalid"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.10.005"}

After synchronization of estrus, the ovaries of crossbred beef heifers (N = 5) were assessed using daily US with a GE Voluson i US scanner until the end of the first follicle wave, then every other day until emergence of the final (ovulatory) wave, when daily US resumed until ovulation. Follicle and CL growth were recorded and mapped. Measures of diameter (2D) and volume (3D) of the DF from the first and ovulatory waves of the cycles; and CL development were captured and stored for further analysis. Blood flow to the DF and CL were assessed using 3D power Doppler US measuring vascularization index (VI; %), vascularization flow index (0/100) and flow index (0/100). Jugular blood samples were collected every 24 hours for progesterone from the first estrus until the second ovulation. Concentrations of estradiol (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured every 8 hours from estrus to second follicle wave emergence; then, E2 only was measured from final follicle wave emergence until ovulation. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED and PROC REG in SAS. Dominant follicle blood flow tended to decrease during follicle wave emergence and DF VI increased (P < 0.05) 24 hours before ovulation after peak E2. Measures of the DF and CL volume (3D) were highly predictive of 2D diameter measures throughout the cycle (P < 0.0001). Predictive values (r(2)) for day of wave emergence and day from ovulation were similar for 2D and 3D measures; however, 2D measures had higher repeatability when compared with 3D measures. There was no relationship between CL VI and progesterone early in the cycle (r(2) = 0.12; P = 0.1); however, there was a strong positive relationship approaching ovulation (r(2) = 0.77; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, 3D power Doppler measures of blood flow appears to be representative of vascular changes in the DF and CL throughout the estrous cycle.

{"title": "Q6, a novel hypoxia-targeted drug, regulates hypoxia-inducible factor signaling via an autophagy-dependent mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Tumor hypoxia underlies treatment failure and yields more aggressive and metastatic cancer phenotypes. Although therapeutically targeting these hypoxic environments has been proposed for many years, to date no approaches have shown the therapeutic value to gain regulatory approval. Here, we demonstrated that a novel hypoxia-activated prodrug, Q6, exhibits potent antiproliferative efficacy under hypoxic conditions and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, with no obvious toxicity being detected in 2 normal liver cell lines. Treatment with Q6 markedly downregulated HIF1A [hypoxia inducible factor 1, \u03b1 subunit (basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor)] expression and transcription of the downstream target gene, VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A). This dual hypoxia-targeted modulation mechanism leads to high potency in suppressing tumor growth and vascularization in 2 in vivo models. Intriguingly, it is the autophagy-dependent degradation pathway that plays a crucial role in Q6-induced attenuation of HIF1A expression, rather than the proteasome-dependent pathway, which is normally regarded as the predominant mechanism underlying posttranslational regulation of HIF1A. Inhibition of autophagy, either by short interfering RNA (siRNA) or by chemical inhibitors, blocked Q6-induced HIF1A degradation. Autophagic degradation of HIF1A was further confirmed by the observation that HIF1A coimmunoprecipitated with the ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein, SQSTM1, which is degraded through autophagy. Additionally, silencing of SQSTM1 inhibited Q6-induced HIF1A degradation. These findings suggest that the novel hypoxia-targeted agent, Q6, has potential clinical value in the therapy of HCC. Furthermore, the identification of autophagy as a crucial regulator of HIF1A provides new insights into hypoxia-related treatments.", "journal": "Autophagy", "date": "2013-11-14", "authors": ["Xiao-WenLiu", "Tian-YuCai", "HongZhu", "JiCao", "YiSu", "Yong-ZhouHu", "Qiao-JunHe", "BoYang"], "doi": "10.4161/auto.26838\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0749\n10.1245/s10434-011-1570-1\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2821\n10.1038/nrc1187\n10.1002/hep.25497\n10.1038/nrc1367\n10.1007/s10555-007-9059-x\n10.1097/00042737-200505000-00002\n10.1007/s10555-010-9224-5\n10.1017/S1462399409001173\n10.1182/blood-2004-07-2958\n10.1126/science.1059796\n10.1016/j.tips.2012.01.005\n10.1038/nrd1199\n10.3390/molecules17089683\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3096\n10.1002/hep.510280111\n10.1016/j.tibs.2012.06.004\n10.1038/446745a\n10.1126/science.290.5497.1717\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2634\n10.1016/j.jhep.2011.07.031\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1439\n10.1007/s00280-012-1852-8\n10.1101/gad.2016211\n10.4161/auto.7.4.14397\n10.1074/jbc.M800102200\n10.1101/gad.521709\n10.1083/jcb.200507002"}

This review will summarize how VCA recipients are monitored, outcomes observed, and what aspects are unique to VCA.\nOf about 90 documented cases, 10% of VCA recipients are out more than 10 years and 14% are out 5 or more years. There have been both graft losses and patient mortality. In most cases, these losses have been acute, most within the first year, and all within 3 years. Unlike SOT, VCA grafts function well during severe rejection. Chronic rejection-like sequelae are less frequent than in SOT, but do appear. Immunosuppression ranges from standard protocols to novel trials aimed at immunosuppression minimization. Patient selection greatly affects the outcome. Graft loss after year 1 is associated with compliance issues.\nFunctional outcomes have exceeded expectations. VCA recipients enjoy a quality of life not achievable with conventional reconstruction. Outstanding long-term results of more than a decade have been achieved. Monitoring of VCA patients will require new strategies to incorporate external visualization and effects of environment on rejection.

In hyaloid vessels devoid of the support of astrocytes, we demonstrate that tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 and occludin, are regularly expressed at the junction of endothelial cells. To figure out the factor influencing the formation of tight junctions in hyaloid vessels, we further progress to investigate the interactions between endothelial cells and pericytes, two representative constituent cells in hyaloid vessels. Interestingly, endothelial cells interact with pericytes in the early postnatal periods and the interaction between two cell types provokes the up-regulation of transforming growth factor \u03b21. Further in vitro experiments demonstrate that transforming growth factor \u03b21 induces the activation of Smad2 and Smad3 and the formation of tight junction proteins. Taken together, in hyaloid vessels, pericytes seem to regulate the formation of tight junctions by the interaction with endothelial cells even without the support of astrocytes.

{"title": "Corneal changes in xeroderma pigmentosum: a clinicopathologic report.", "abstract": "To report the clinicopathologic features of corneal involvement in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.\nRetrospective review of corneal histopathology.\nThirteen corneal specimens of 11 patients with xeroderma pigmentosum who underwent keratoplasty (lamellar/full-thickness) for corneal involvement were studied. Five-micrometer-thick sections were made from all the samples and stained using hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff stains. A light microscopic examination was performed to study the histopathologic changes.\nThe corneal findings on clinical examination were haze, scarring, vascularization, stromal edema, pigment clumps on endothelial surface, and corneal thinning. The histopathologic evaluation revealed changes in all layers of cornea. Epithelial changes seen were intraepithelial edema, fibrosis, epithelial downgrowths, and pannus formation. The Bowman membrane was fragmented or absent. Stroma was characterized by alteration in the lamellar pattern, scarring, edema, loss of keratocytic nuclei, and calcification. The Descemet membrane was thickened to a variable extent in most specimens and there was marked loss of endothelial cells in all.\nMost histologic features are consistent with the previous few reports. The remarkable finding in all corneal specimens was a moderate to severe degree of loss of the endothelial cells. This noteworthy finding supports the ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced endothelial cell damage in these patients. This has an important clinical implication when planning for anterior lamellar keratoplasty, as endothelial cell density may be subnormal in these patients.", "journal": "American journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["SunitaChaurasia", "KaustubhMulay", "MuralidharRamappa", "VirenderSangwan", "SomasheilaMurthy", "RohiniNair", "GeetaVemuganti"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ajo.2013.10.016"}
{"title": "Significance of calcium phosphate coatings for the enhancement of new bone osteogenesis--a review.", "abstract": "A systematic analysis of results available from in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials on the effects of biocompatible calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings is presented. An overview of the most frequently used methods to prepare CaP-based coatings was conducted. Dense, homogeneous, highly adherent and biocompatible CaP or hybrid organic/inorganic CaP coatings with tailored properties can be deposited. It has been demonstrated that CaP coatings have a significant effect on the bone regeneration process. In vitro experiments using different cells (e.g. SaOS-2, human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblast-like cells) have revealed that CaP coatings enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation and differentiation to promote bone regeneration. However, in vivo, the exact mechanism of osteogenesis in response to CaP coatings is unclear; indeed, there are conflicting reports of the effectiveness of CaP coatings, with results ranging from highly effective to no significant or even negative effects. This review therefore highlights progress in CaP coatings for orthopaedic implants and discusses the future research and use of these devices. Currently, an exciting area of research is in bioactive hybrid composite CaP-based coatings containing both inorganic (CaP coating) and organic (collagen, bone morphogenetic proteins, arginylglycylaspartic acid etc.) components with the aim of promoting tissue ingrowth and vascularization. Further investigations are necessary to reveal the relative influences of implant design, surgical procedure, and coating characteristics (thickness, structure, topography, porosity, wettability etc.) on the long-term clinical effects of hybrid CaP coatings. In addition to commercially available plasma spraying, other effective routes for the fabrication of hybrid CaP coatings for clinical use still need to be determined and current progress is discussed.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["Roman ASurmenev", "Maria ASurmeneva", "Anna AIvanova"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.036"}

However no major therapeutic effects have been observed to date, mainly because of the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. Among novel strategies to target tumor vasculature, some oncolytic viruses open up new prospects. In this context, we addressed the question whether the rodent parvovirus H-1PV can target endothelial cells. We show that cultures of human normal (HUVEC) and immortalized (KS-IMM) endothelial cells sustain an abortive viral cycle upon infection with H-1PV and are sensitive to H-1PV cytotoxicity. H-1PV significantly inhibits infected KS-IMM tumor growth. This effect may be traced back by the virus ability to both kill proliferating endothelial cells and inhibit VEGF production Recombinant H-1PV vectors can also transduce tumor cells with chemokines endowed with anti-angiogenesis properties, and warrant further validation for the treatment of highly vascularized tumors.", "journal": "Virology", "date": "2013-11-12", "authors": ["MurielLavie", "SofieStruyf", "AlexandraStroh-Dege", "JeanRommelaere", "JoVan Damme", "ChristianeDinsart"], "doi": "10.1016/j.virol.2013.09.019"}

CBC analysis revealed a regenerative, microcytic, hypochromic anemia with thrombocytosis, consistent with iron deficiency. A fecal occult blood test was positive. Ultrasound imaging revealed numerous, vascularized focal liver lesions that suggested metastases. The macaque's appetite continued to decrease, and he became more lethargic. At this point, the investigator elected to euthanize the macaque. At necropsy, the ileocolic junction was white and abnormally thickened, and the liver was pale tan with approximately 18 discrete white masses randomly scattered throughout the hepatic parenchyma. Histologically, the mass at the ileocolic junction was identified as an intestinal adenocarcinoma, whereas the liver masses were confirmed to be undifferentiated hepatic sarcomas. This case report describes a rhesus macaque that had 2 unrelated primary neoplasms.

The present study was to design and form a new vascularized tissue-engineered construct using pre-differentiated rADSCs, arteriovenous vascular bundle and porous nHA-PA 66 scaffold.\nrADSCs were pre-differentiated to endothelial cells (rADSCs-Endo) and then incorporated in nHA-PA 66 scaffolds in vitro. Subsequently, in vivo experiments were carried out according to the following groups: Group A (rADSCs-Endo/nHA-PA 66 scaffold with arteriovenous vascular bundle), Group B (rADSCs/nHA-PA 66 scaffold with arteriovenous vascular bundle); Group C (nHA-PA66 scaffold with arteriovenous vascular bundle), Group D (nHA-PA 66 scaffold only). The vessel density and vessel diameter were measured based on histological and immunohistochemical evaluation, furthermore, the VEGF-C, FGF-2 and BMP-2 protein expressions were also evaluated by western blot analysis.\nThe results of in vivo experiments showed that the vessel density and vessel diameter in group A were significantly higher than the other three groups. Between Group B and C, no statistical difference was observed at each time point. In accordance with the results, there were dramatically higher expressions of VEGF-C and FGF-2 protein in Group A than that of Group B, C and D at 2 or 4 weeks. Statistical differences were not observed in VEGF-C and FGF-2 expression between Group B and C. BMP-2 was not expressed in any group at each time point.\nCompared with muscular wrapping method, arteriovenous vascular bundle implantation could promote vascularization of the scaffold; and the angiogenesis of the scaffold was significantly accelerated when pre-differentiated rADSCs (endothelial differentiation) were added.

The aim of this study was to show the effectiveness of liposomes as an ultrasound contrast agent to describe the 3-D vascular architecture of a tumor. Eight C57BL/6 mice grafted with syngeneic B16-F10 murine melanoma cells were injected with a bolus of 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (DSPC)-based non-targeted liposomes and with a bolus of microbubbles. 3-D contrast-enhanced images of the tumor lesions were acquired in three conditions: pre-contrast, after the injection of microbubbles, and after the injection of liposomes. By using a previously developed reconstruction and characterization image processing technique, we obtained the 3-D representation of the vascular architecture in these three conditions. Six descriptive parameters of these networks were also computed: the number of vascular trees (NT), the vascular density (VD), the number of branches, the 2-D curvature measure, the number of vascular flexes of the vessels, and the 3-D curvature. Results showed that all the vascular descriptors obtained by liposome-based images were statistically equal to those obtained by using microbubbles, except the VD which was found to be lower for liposome images. All the six descriptors computed in pre-contrast conditions had values that were statistically lower than those computed in presence of contrast, both for liposomes and microbubbles. Liposomes have already been used in cancer therapy for the selective ultrasound-mediated delivery of drugs.

{"title": "Cutaneous collateral axonal sprouting re-innervates the skin component and restores sensation of denervated Swine osteomyocutaneous alloflaps.", "abstract": "Reconstructive transplantation such as extremity and face transplantation is a viable treatment option for select patients with devastating tissue loss. Sensorimotor recovery is a critical determinant of overall success of such transplants. Although motor function recovery has been extensively studied, mechanisms of sensory re-innervation are not well established. Recent clinical reports of face transplants confirm progressive sensory improvement even in cases where optimal repair of sensory nerves was not achieved. Two forms of sensory nerve regeneration are known. In regenerative sprouting, axonal outgrowth occurs from the transected nerve stump while in collateral sprouting, reinnervation of denervated tissue occurs through growth of uninjured axons into the denervated tissue. The latter mechanism may be more important in settings where transected sensory nerves cannot be re-apposed. In this study, denervated osteomyocutaneous alloflaps (hind- limb transplants) from Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-defined MGH miniature swine were performed to specifically evaluate collateral axonal sprouting for cutaneous sensory re-innervation. The skin component of the flap was externalized and serial skin sections extending from native skin to the grafted flap were biopsied. In order to visualize regenerating axonal structures in the dermis and epidermis, 50 um frozen sections were immunostained against axonal and Schwann cell markers. In all alloflaps, collateral axonal sprouts from adjacent recipient skin extended into the denervated skin component along the dermal-epidermal junction from the periphery towards the center. On day 100 post-transplant, regenerating sprouts reached 0.5 cm into the flap centripetally. Eight months following transplant, epidermal fibers were visualized 1.5 cm from the margin (rate of regeneration 0.06 mm per day).

{"title": "Emerging role of TRP channels in cell migration: from tumor vascularization to metastasis.", "abstract": "Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels modulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, controlling critical cytosolic and nuclear events that are involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. It is not, therefore, surprising that the expression of some TRP channels is altered during tumor growth and metastasis. Cell migration of both epithelial and endothelial cells is an essential step of the so-called metastatic cascade that leads to the spread of the disease within the body. It is in fact required for both tumor vascularization as well as for tumor cell invasion into adjacent tissues and intravasation into blood/lymphatic vessels. Studies from the last 15 years have unequivocally shown that the ion channles and the transport proteins also play important roles in cell migration.

In this study, we set out to determine the consequences of severe systemic inflammatory stress on developmental retinal vascularization and evaluate the subsequent outcome on retinal function in later life.\nSystemic inflammatory stress was induced in C57BL/6J mouse pups by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg) at postnatal day 4. In response to LPS, retinal inflammation was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of diverse inflammatory markers. A detailed and systematic analysis of retinal microglial infiltration, retinal vascular morphology, density, and growth rate was performed at key time points throughout retinal vascularization. Retinal function in adult life was assessed by using electroretinography at 6 weeks postinjection.\nAs early as 48 hours after intraperitoneal administration of LPS, a significant increase in retinal vascular density was noted throughout the retina. A pronounced increase in the number of activated microglial cell was observed in the retinal ganglion cell layer and in the outer plexiform layer just prior to their vascularization; direct physical contact between activated microglia and sprouting vessels suggested that microglia partake in promoting the aberrant retinal vascularization. With maturity, animals subjected to perinatal inflammatory stress displayed depleted retinal vascular beds and had significantly decreased retinal function as determined by electroretinography.\nOur data reveal that early severe postnatal inflammatory stress leads to abnormal retinal vascular development and increased vessel anastomosis and, ultimately, permanently compromises retinal function. The aberrant and initially exaggerated retinal vascularization observed is associated with microglial activation, providing a cellular mechanism by which perinatal sepsis predisposes to ROP.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2013-11-10", "authors": ["SophieTremblay", "KhalilMiloudi", "SamanehChaychi", "SandraFavret", "Fran\u00e7oisBinet", "AnnaPolosa", "PierreLachapelle", "SylvainChemtob", "PrzemyslawSapieha"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.13-12496"}

To determine the inhibition of cell proliferation of S516, we used H460 lung carcinoma cells. The alteration of microtubules was analyzed using immunoblot, RT-PCR and confocal imaging. To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine and/or CKD-516, H460 xenograft mice were treated with CKD-516 (2.5 mg/kg) and/or gemcitabine (40 mg/kg), and tumor growth was compared with vehicle-treated control. For histologic analysis, liver, spleen and tumor tissues from H460 xenograft mice were obtained 12 and 24 h after CKD-516 injection.\nCytoskeletal changes of HUVECs treated with 10 nM S516 were assessed by immunoblot and confocal imaging. S516 disrupted tubulin assembly and resulted in microtubule dysfunction, which induced cell cycle arrest (G2/M). S516 markedly enhanced the depolymerization of microtubules, perhaps due to the vascular disrupting properties of S516. Interestingly, S516 decreased the amount of total tubulin protein in HUVECs. Especially, S516 decreased mRNA expression \u03b1-tubulin (HUVECs only) and \u03b2-tubulin (HUVECs and H460 cells) at an early time point (4 h). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that S516 changed the cellular microtubule network and inhibited the formation of polymerized microtubules. Extensive central necrosis of tumors was evident by 12 h after treatment with CKD-516 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.).

Chalkey method revealed no significant difference in the extent of villous vasculature for the control group in comparison with MA and BO.\nAs we identified relatively low quantity of HC in BO associated with defective vasculature, we hypothesize that an inadequate microvessel formation after hypoxic insult can explain the pathogenesis of BO.

Twelve animal experiments were used to determine in vivo MRI parameters. TMMC tracking was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in four rabbits, which underwent MRN in the hepatic artery, three without steering, two in real-time, and three as blank controls. TMMC distribution in the right and left liver lobes, determined by ex vivo MR image analysis, was compared to the one obtained by cobalt level analysis.\nTMMC induced a hypointense signal that overran the physical size of the sample on MR images.

These changes include: (i) proliferation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatoblasts within the liver coinciding with parenchymal expansion, (ii) elongation of extrahepatic bile ducts, which allows for proper gallbladder (GB) formation, and (iii) duodenal elongation and rotation, which coincides with all of the above to connect the intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and pancreatic ductal systems with the intestine. It is well established that cross talk between endodermal and mesenchymal components of the foregut occurs, particularly regarding the vascularization of developing organs. Furthermore, genetic mutations in mesenchymal and hepatic compartments of the developing foregut result in similar foregut pathologies: hypoplastic liver, absence of GB, biliary atresia (intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic), and failure of gut elongation and rotation.

Accordingly, we characterized the vascular network and the expression pattern of angiogenic RTK in the most frequent pediatric brain tumors. In a retrospective collection of 44 cases (14 astrocytoma, 16 ependymoma and 14 medulloblastoma), immunohistochemistry for VEGFR1, VEGFR2, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, and c-Kit as well as microvessel labeling with CD34 and SMA were conducted on surgical specimens. We found a significantly higher vascular density in ependymoma. Glomeruloid formations were abundant in medulloblastoma but rare or almost absent in astrocytoma and ependymoma, respectively. C-Kit and VEGFR2 labeled blood vessels were more abundant in ependymoma than in the other two types of tumors. In contrast, medulloblastoma contained higher number of PDGFR\u03b1 expressing vessels. In tumor cells, we found no VEGFR2 but VEGFR1 expression in all three tumor types. PDGFR\u03b1 was strongly expressed on the tumor cells in all three malignancies, while PDGFR\u03b2 tumor cell expression was present in the majority of medulloblastoma cases. Interestingly, small populations of c-Kit expressing cancer cells were found in a number of medulloblastoma and ependymoma cases. Our study suggests that different angiogenic mechanisms are present in ependymoma and medulloblastoma. Furthermore ependymoma patients may benefit from anti-angiogenic therapies based on the high vascularization as well as the endothelial expression of c-kit and VEGFR2. The expression pattern of the receptors on tumor cells also suggests the targeting of specific angiogenic tyrosine kinase receptors may have direct antitumor activity.

But little is known about the optimal pore size and level of cross-linking. Different formulations of dermal substitutes with unidirectional pores were tested in porcine full-thickness wounds in combination with autologous split skin mesh grafts (SSG). Effect on wound healing was evaluated both macro- and microscopically. CE scaffolds with a pore size of 80 or 100\u00a0\u03bcm resulted in good wound healing after one-stage grafting. Application of scaffolds with a larger average pore size (120\u00a0\u03bcm) resulted in more myofibroblasts and more foreign body giant cells (FBGC). Moderate crosslinking impaired wound healing as it resulted in more wound contraction, more FBGC and increased epidermal thickness compared to no cross-linking. In addition, take rate and redness were negatively affected compared to SSG only. Vascularization and the number of myofibroblasts were not affected by cross-linking. Surprisingly, stability of cross-linked scaffolds was not increased in the wound environment, in contrast to in vitro results. Cross-linking reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro, which might explain the reduced clinical outcome. The non-cross-linked CE substitute with unidirectional pores allowed one-stage grafting of SSG, resulting in good wound healing. In addition, only a very mild foreign body reaction was observed. Cross-linking of CE scaffolds negatively affected wound healing on several important parameters.

In this work, porous scaffolds of a collagen/hydroxyapatite nanocomposite were modified with heparin to generate biomimetic bone matrices which are able to release angiogenic factors in a controlled manner. Heparin was either integrated during material synthesis (in situ) or added to the scaffolds after their fabrication (post). Both approaches resulted in stable incorporation of heparin into the matrix of mineralized collagen. Investigations of binding and release of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A\u2081\u2086\u2085) loaded onto the scaffolds revealed an enhanced binding capacity as well as a sustained and nearly constant delivery of VEGF as result of both heparin modification methods. The release rate could be controlled by varying the quantity of incorporated heparin and the modification method. Although the biological activity of VEGF released after 7 days from the unmodified scaffolds was reduced in comparison to control VEGF, it was maintained after release from post or even enhanced after release from in situ modified scaffolds. In conclusion, the heparin-modified scaffolds of mineralized collagen exhibited favorable growth factor binding and release properties and may be beneficial to stimulate vascularization.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Extensively studied for its capacity to promote cancer progression, heparanase enzyme was recently implicated as an important determinant in several inflammatory disorders as well. Applying immunohistochemical staining, we detected preferential expression of heparanase by epidermal keratinocytes in human psoriatic lesions. To investigate the role of the enzyme in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we utilized heparanase transgenic mice in a model of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced cutaneous inflammation. We report that over-expression of the enzyme promotes development of mouse skin lesions that strongly recapitulate the human disease in terms of histomorphological appearance and molecular/cellular characteristics. Importantly, heparanase of epidermal origin appears to facilitate abnormal activation of skin-infiltrating macrophages, thus generating psoriasis-like inflammation conditions, characterized by induction of STAT3, enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling, elevated expression of TNF-\u03b1 and increased vascularization. Taken together, our results reveal, for the first time, involvement of heparanase in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and highlight a role for the enzyme in facilitating abnormal interactions between immune and epithelial cell subsets of the affected skin. Heparanase inhibitors (currently under clinical testing in malignant diseases) could hence turn highly beneficial in psoriatic patients as well.", "journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "date": "2013-10-31", "authors": ["ImmanuelLerner", "EyalZcharia", "TzahiNeuman", "EstherHermano", "Ariel MRubinstein", "IsraelVlodavsky", "MichaelElkin"], "doi": "10.1007/s00018-013-1496-9"}

{"title": "Ontogeny in the tube-crested dinosaur Parasaurolophus (Hadrosauridae) and heterochrony in hadrosaurids.", "abstract": "The tube-crested hadrosaurid dinosaur Parasaurolophus is remarkable for its unusual cranial ornamentation, but little is known about its growth and development, particularly relative to well-documented ontogenetic series for lambeosaurin hadrosaurids (such as Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus). The skull and skeleton of a juvenile Parasaurolophus from the late Campanian-aged (\u223c75.5 Ma) Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, USA, represents the smallest and most complete specimen yet described for this taxon. The individual was approximately 2.5 m in body length (\u223c25% maximum adult body length) at death, with a skull measuring 246 mm long and a femur 329 mm long. A histological section of the tibia shows well-vascularized, woven and parallel-fibered primary cortical bone typical of juvenile ornithopods. The histological section revealed no lines of arrested growth or annuli, suggesting the animal may have still been in its first year at the time of death. Impressions of the upper rhamphotheca are preserved in association with the skull, showing that the soft tissue component for the beak extended for some distance beyond the limits of the oral margin of the premaxilla. In marked contrast with the lengthy tube-like crest in adult Parasaurolophus, the crest of the juvenile specimen is low and hemicircular in profile, with an open premaxilla-nasal fontanelle. Unlike juvenile lambeosaurins, the nasal passages occupy nearly the entirety of the crest in juvenile Parasaurolophus. Furthermore, Parasaurolophus initiated development of the crest at less than 25% maximum skull size, contrasting with 50% of maximum skull size in hadrosaurs such as Corythosaurus. This early development may correspond with the larger and more derived form of the crest in Parasaurolophus, as well as the close relationship between the crest and the respiratory system. In general, ornithischian dinosaurs formed bony cranial ornamentation at a relatively younger age and smaller size than seen in extant birds. This may reflect, at least in part, that ornithischians probably reached sexual maturity prior to somatic maturity, whereas birds become reproductively mature after reaching adult size.", "journal": "PeerJ", "date": "2013-10-30", "authors": ["Andrew AFarke", "Derek JChok", "AnnisaHerrero", "BrandonScolieri", "SarahWerning"], "doi": "10.7717/peerj.182\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036112\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031295\n10.1016/j.cretres.2013.05.003\n10.1002/ar.20978\n10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.01.026\n10.1080/08912963.2010.499169\n10.1007/s00338-009-0563-z\n10.1098/rspb.2008.0912\n10.2307/1005355\n10.1139/e01-016\n10.2307/2412696\n10.1126/science.1224495\n10.1017/S0952836903003819\n10.1098/rsbl.2007.0254\n10.1038/35086558\n10.1666/04027.1\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00611.x\n10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[373:AAROLM]2.0.CO;2\n10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[642:AJPOHB]2.0.CO;2\n10.1002/ar.20984\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.2007.00349.x\n10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[917:VCANLH]2.0.CO;2\n10.1002/ar.20988\n10.1139/e72-015\n10.1086/498196\n10.1086/498193\n10.1111/j.1502-3931.2011.00300.x\n10.1671/0272-4634(2000)020[0115:LBHOTH]2.0.CO;2\n10.1671/039.029.0312\n10.1098/rspb.2006.3643\n10.1371/journal.pone.0007626\n10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027<0039:COOSEA>2.0.CO;2\n10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01253.x\n10.1017/S000632319800512X\n10.1111/jeb.12181\n10.1080/02724634.2013.743898\n10.1073/pnas.0708903105\n10.1002/ar.20912\n10.1130/SPE40-p1\n10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.06.024\n10.1098/rsbl.2012.0949\n10.1002/ar.a.20341\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00617.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0069835\n10.1007/s12549-011-0068-y\n10.1126/science.1114942\n10.1016/j.sedgeo.2006.10.001\n10.1016/j.cretres.2005.01.002\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.1997.tb00340.x\n10.1080/02724634.2012.679878\n10.1371/journal.pone.0021092\n10.1111/j.1095-8312.2001.tb01355.x\n10.1002/jmor.10029\n10.1111/brv.12041\n10.1671/A1034-11\n10.1371/journal.pone.0033539\n10.1670/10-274.1"}

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a useful diagnostic tool that provides cross-sectional and volumetric imaging of posterior segment microstructure. Typical OCT findings in PCV may reveal a classic hyperreflectivity in the choroidal layers known as the \"double-layer\" sign. This sign is indicative of an abnormal choroidal vascular network. Indocyanine green angiography is also useful for the diagnosis of PCV and clearly identifies the polyp-like lesions arising from the choroidal vasculature.\nA 53-year-old African American woman presented with complaints of gradually decreasing vision in the left eye (OS). Clinical examination revealed moderately reduced acuity OS with a small central scotoma found on Amsler grid testing. Dilated fundus examination revealed a hemorrhagic RPE detachment with suspicion of a choroidal neovascular membrane in the foveal region of the OS. Exudative leakage appeared circumferentially around the macula OS. Optical coherence tomography of the OS also revealed two highly reflective layers: one at the level of the RPE and another beneath the RPE (\"double-layer\" sign). The patient was referred to a retina subspecialist for angiography and treatment consideration.\nIt is important to distinguish PCV from other variants of choroidal neovascularization.

{"title": "Flow-focusing regimes for accelerated production of monodisperse drug-loadable microbubbles toward clinical-scale applications.", "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging often calls for the injection of contrast agents, micron-sized bubbles which echo strongly in blood and help distinguish vascularized tissue. Such microbubbles are also being augmented for targeted drug delivery and gene therapy, by the addition of surface receptors and therapeutic payloads. Unfortunately, conventional production methods yield a polydisperse population, whose nonuniform resonance and drug-loading are less than ideal. An alternative technique, microfluidic flow-focusing, is able to produce highly monodisperse microbubbles with stabilizing lipid membranes and drug-carrying oil layers. However, the published 1 kHz production rate for these uniform drug bubbles is very low compared to conventional methods, and must be improved before clinical use can be practical. In this study, flow-focusing production of oil-layered lipid microbubbles was tested up to 300 kHz, with coalescence suppressed by high lipid concentrations or inclusion of Pluronic F68 surfactant in the lipid solution. The transition between geometry-controlled and dripping production regimes was analysed, and production scaling was found to be continuous, with a power trend of exponent ~5/12 similar to literature. Unlike prior studies with this trend, however, scaling curves here were found to be pressure-dependent, particularly at lower pressure-flow equilibria (e.g. <15 psi). Adjustments in oil flow rate were observed to have a similar effect, akin to a pressure change of 1-3 psi.

We assessed how high fat diet (HFD) affects inflammation, proliferative, and developmental events in the pubertal gland, since dysregulation of these can promote mammary tumorigenesis. To test the effect of HFD initiated during puberty on tumorigenesis, we utilized BALB/c mice, for which HFD neither induces obesity nor metabolic syndrome, allowing dissociation of HFD effects from other conditions associated with HFD.\nPubertal BALB/c mice were fed a low fat diet (12% kcal fat) or a HFD (60% kcal fat), and subjected to carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced tumorigenesis.\nHFD elevated mammary gland expression of inflammatory and growth factor genes at 3 and 4 weeks of diet. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), robustly induced at 4 weeks, has direct mitogenic activity in mammary epithelial cells and, as a potent inducer of NF-\u03baB activity, may induce inflammatory genes. Three weeks of HFD induced a transient influx of eosinophils into the mammary gland, consistent with elevated inflammatory factors. At 10 weeks, prior to the appearance of palpable tumors, there were increased numbers of abnormal mammary epithelial lesions, enhanced cellular proliferation, increased growth factors, chemokines associated with immune-suppressive regulatory T cells, increased vascularization, and elevated M2 macrophages. HFD dramatically reduced tumor latency. Early developing tumors were more proliferative and were associated with increased levels of tumor-related growth factors, including increased plasma levels of HGF in tumor-bearing animals. Early HFD tumors also had increased vascularization, and more intra-tumor and stromal M2 macrophages.\nTaken together in this non-obesogenic context, HFD promotion of inflammatory processes, as well as local and systemically increased growth factor expression, are likely responsible for the enhanced tumorigenesis. It is noteworthy that although DMBA mutagenesis is virtually random in its targeting of genes in tumorigenesis, the short latency tumors arising in animals on HFD showed a unique gene expression profile, highlighting the potent overarching influence of HFD.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2013-10-26", "authors": ["YongZhao", "Ying SiowTan", "Mark DAupperlee", "Ingeborg MLangohr", "Erin LKirk", "Melissa ATroester", "Richard CSchwartz", "Sandra ZHaslam"], "doi": "10.1186/bcr3561\n10.1093/aje/152.6.514\n10.1007/s10549-010-1116-4\n10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-11-0260\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990601)85:11<2400::AID-CNCR15>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.1017/S0029665108006976\n10.1073/pnas.0611647104\n10.1007/s10911-008-9084-6\n10.1186/bcr441\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4005\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.021\n10.1186/bcr1745\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63568-7\n10.1186/bcr1840\n10.1007/s10549-009-0586-8\n10.1093/jnci/djk094\n10.1038/ijo.2010.51\n10.1007/BF00918341\n10.1210/en.2005-0346\n10.1016/0092-8674(90)90077-R\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203277\n10.1152/ajpendo.90996.2008\n10.1073/pnas.1732707100\n10.1074/jbc.M308545200\n10.1210/endo-126-1-596\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.08.025\n10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00615-3\n10.1126/science.284.5411.156\n10.1177/0192623308323920\n10.1128/MCB.01298-06\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.01.019\n10.1073/pnas.0915148107\n10.1073/pnas.95.7.3597\n10.1023/A:1009507030633\n10.1016/j.cell.2008.07.025\n10.1016/j.devcel.2009.02.012\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61158-3\n10.1095/biolreprod.107.067272\n10.1126/science.1131000\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208417\n10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00528.x\n10.1016/S0959-8049(97)00062-2\n10.1016/j.ejca.2003.10.016\n10.1186/bcr730\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.12.019\n10.1007/s10585-012-9453-9\n10.1038/nrc2780\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01648.x\n10.1007/BF01833334\n10.1111/j.1749-6632.1996.tb16236.x\n10.1016/j.mce.2004.02.016\n10.1038/sj.onc.1205895\n10.1073/pnas.95.5.2302\n10.1023/A:1014370616864\n10.1016/S0165-4608(99)00236-8\n10.1083/jcb.95.1.285\n10.1186/bcr917\n10.1186/bcr2723\n10.1186/bcr615\n10.1177/1758834011422557\n10.1016/j.biocel.2008.06.018\n10.1016/j.tig.2011.12.002\n10.1200/JCO.2011.36.2574\n10.1007/s10549-007-9632-6\n10.1186/bcr3177\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3237\n10.1006/excr.1997.3664\n10.1007/s10549-012-1957-0\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.034\n10.1186/bcr3108\n10.1007/s12672-010-0012-z\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.07.014\n10.1111/j.1365-2826.2012.02327.x\n10.1007/978-1-61779-536-7_1\n10.1084/jem.185.12.2171\n10.1084/jem.167.5.1737\n10.1126/science.1201475\n10.1074/jbc.273.32.20551\n10.1038/oby.2010.55\n10.1371/journal.pone.0024671\n10.4049/jimmunol.0904084\n10.1002/ijc.23392\n10.1371/journal.pone.0019495\n10.1038/nri978\n10.1016/j.cyto.2012.12.002\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005125\n10.1186/1471-2407-11-213\n10.4103/1477-3163.92308\n10.1006/cimm.1995.1058\n10.1002/ijc.26100\n10.1186/ar86\n10.1186/ar575\n10.1055/s-0030-1255354\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014\n10.1016/j.coph.2009.06.020\n10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.03.004\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.190\n10.1210/en.2009-0543\n10.1152/ajpendo.00490.2010\n10.1186/1472-6793-10-20\n10.1017/S0007114511002868\n10.1530/eje.1.02082\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029524\n10.2337/db07-0648\n10.1152/ajpendo.00433.2004\n10.1080/01635581.2011.535956\n10.1207/s15327914nc5002_7\n10.1186/bcr2927"}
{"title": "Role of hypoxia-inducible factors in breast cancer metastasis.", "abstract": "Human breast tumors contain regions of hypoxia in which cells that are located far from a functional blood vessel have significantly reduced oxygen concentrations when compared with normal mammary tissue. Breast cancer cells adapt to hypoxic conditions by increasing levels of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which induce the expression of multiple genes involved in angiogenesis, glucose utilization, resistance to oxidative stress, cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. Breast cancer patients with increased HIF expression levels in primary tumor biopsies are at increased risk of metastasis. This is an important finding since 90% of breast cancer deaths are the result of metastasis, primarily to the bone, lungs, liver, brain and regional lymph nodes. Although the prognostic significance of reduced oxygen levels in primary breast tumors of cancer patients is well recognized, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced, HIF-dependent breast cancer metastasis are just beginning to be uncovered. Recent studies have implicated HIF target genes in every step of the metastatic process. Drugs, such as digoxin, show the potential therapeutic effects of blocking HIF activity by decreasing primary tumor growth, vascularization, invasion and metastasis in animal models of breast cancer.", "journal": "Future oncology (London, England)", "date": "2013-10-26", "authors": ["Daniele MGilkes", "Gregg LSemenza"], "doi": "10.2217/fon.13.92"}

Studies of many human tumors, however, suggest that their microcirculation may be provided by nonsprouting vessels and that a variety of tumors can grow and metastasize without angiogenesis. Vessel co-option, where tumor cells migrate along the preexisting vessels of the host organ, is regarded as an alternative tumor blood supply. Vessel co-option may occur in many malignancies, but so far mostly reported in highly vascularized tissues such as brain, lung, and liver. In primary and metastatic lung cancer and liver metastasis from different primary origins, as much as 10-30% of the tumors are reported to use this alternative blood supply. In addition, vessel co-option is introduced as a potential explanation of antiangiogenic drug resistance, although the impact of vessel co-option in this clinical setting is still to be further explored. In this review we discuss tumor vessel co-option with specific examples of vessel co-option in primary and secondary tumors and a consideration of the clinical implications of this alternative tumor blood supply.", "journal": "Cancer medicine", "date": "2013-10-25", "authors": ["TomDonnem", "JiangtingHu", "MaryFerguson", "OmanmaAdighibe", "CameronSnell", "Adrian LHarris", "Kevin CGatter", "FrancescoPezzella"], "doi": "10.1002/cam4.105"}
{"title": "Na(+) dependent acid-base transporters in the choroid plexus; insights from slc4 and slc9 gene deletion studies.", "abstract": "The choroid plexus epithelium (CPE) is located in the ventricular system of the brain, where it secretes the majority of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that fills the ventricular system and surrounds the central nervous system. The CPE is a highly vascularized single layer of cuboidal cells with an unsurpassed transepithelial water and solute transport rate. Several members of the slc4a family of bicarbonate transporters are expressed in the CPE. In the basolateral membrane the electroneutral Na(+) dependent Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchanger, NCBE (slc4a10) is expressed. In the luminal membrane, the electrogenic Na(+):HCO3 (-) cotransporter, NBCe2 (slc4a5) is expressed. The electroneutral Na(+):HCO3 (-) cotransporter, NBCn1 (slc4a7), has been located in both membranes. In addition to the bicarbonate transporters, the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, NHE1 (slc9a1), is located in the luminal membrane of the CPE. Genetically modified mice targeting slc4a2, slc4a5, slc4a7, slc4a10, and slc9a1 have been generated. Deletion of slc4a5, 7 or 10, or slc9a1 has numerous impacts on CP function and structure in these mice. Removal of the transporters affects brain ventricle size (slc4a5 and slc4a10) and intracellular pH regulation (slc4a7 and slc4a10). In some instances, removal of the proteins from the CPE (slc4a5, 7, and 10) causes changes in abundance and localization of non-target transporters known to be involved in pH regulation and CSF secretion. The focus of this review is to combine the insights gathered from these knockout mice to highlight the impact of slc4 gene deletion on the CSF production and intracellular pH regulation resulting from the deletion of slc4a5, 7 and 10, and slc9a1. Furthermore, the review contains a comparison of the described human mutations of these genes to the findings in the knockout studies.

The objective of this study was to quantify the role of individual factors in determining key network parameters in an effort to construct a set of design principles for engineering vascular networks with prescribed morphologies. To achieve this goal, we developed a multiculture microfluidic platform enabling precise control over paracrine signaling, cell-seeding densities, and hydrogel mechanical properties. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded in fibrin gels and cultured alongside human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). The engineered vessels formed in our device contained patent, perfusable lumens. Communication between the two cell types was found to be critical in avoiding network regression and maintaining stable morphology beyond 4 days. The number of branches, average branch length, percent vascularized area, and average vessel diameter were found to depend uniquely on several input parameters. Importantly, multiple inputs were found to control any given output network parameter. For example, the vessel diameter can be decreased either by applying angiogenic growth factors--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and sphingosine-1-phsophate (S1P)--or by increasing the fibrinogen concentration in the hydrogel. These findings introduce control into the design of MVNs with specified morphological properties for tissue-specific engineering applications.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Each building block included vascular cells by design; modules were submillimeter-sized collagen gels with an outer layer of endothelial cells (ECs), and with embedded adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (adMSCs) to support EC survival and blood vessel maturation in vivo. We transduced the ECs that coat the modules with a lentiviral construct to overexpress the angiogenic extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1). Upon injection of modules in a subcutaneous SCID/Bg mouse model, there was an increase in the number of blood vessels for implants with ECs transduced to overexpress Del-1 compared with control implants (with enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP]-transduced ECs) over the 21-day duration of the study. The greatest difference between Del-1 and eGFP implants and the highest number of blood vessels were observed 7 days after transplantation. The day-7 Del-1 implants also had increased SMA+ staining compared with control, suggesting increased blood vessel maturation through recruitment of SMA+ smooth muscle cells or pericytes to stabilize the newly formed blood vessels. Perfusion studies (microcomputed tomography, ultrasound imaging, and systemic injection of fluorescent UEA-1 or dextran) showed that some of the newly formed blood vessels (both donor derived and host derived, in both Del-1 and eGFP implants) were perfused and connected to the host vasculature as early as 7 days after transplantation, and at later time points as well.

In this study, we examine how the crosslinking agents genipin and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide alter vascular stability and function in microfluidic type I collagen gels in vitro. Under moderate perfusion (\u223c10 dyn/cm(2) shear stress), tubes of blood endothelial cells (ECs) exhibited indistinguishable stability and barrier function in untreated and crosslinked scaffolds. Surprisingly, under low perfusion (\u223c5 dyn/cm(2) shear stress) or nearly zero transmural pressure, microvessels in crosslinked scaffolds remained stable, while those in untreated gels rapidly delaminated and became poorly perfused. Similarly, tubes of lymphatic ECs under intermittent flow were more stable in crosslinked gels than in untreated ones. These effects correlated well with the degree of mechanical stiffening, as predicted by analysis of fracture energies at the cell-scaffold interface. This work demonstrates that crosslinking of collagen scaffolds does not hinder normal EC physiology; instead, crosslinked scaffolds promote vascular stability. Thus, routine crosslinking of scaffolds may assist in vascularization of engineered tissues.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Measurement of choroid plexus perfusion using dynamic susceptibility MR imaging: capillary permeability and age-related changes.", "abstract": "The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a major role in the physiology of the central nervous system. The continuous turnover of CSF is mainly attributed to the highly vascularized choroid plexus (CP) located in the cerebral ventricles which represent a complex interface between blood and CSF. We propose a method for evaluating CP functionality in vivo using perfusion MR imaging and establish the age-related changes of associated parameters.\nFifteen patients with small intracranial tumors were retrospectively studied. MR Imaging was performed on a 3T MR Scanner. Gradient-echo echo planar images were acquired after bolus injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent (CA). The software developed used the combined T1- and T2-effects. The decomposition of the relaxivity signals enables the calculation of the CP capillary permeability (K2). The relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), mean transit time (MTT), and signal slope decrease (SSD) were also calculated.\nThe mean permeability K2 of the extracted CP was 0.033+/-0.18 s(-1). K2 and SSD significantly decreased with subject's age whereas MTT significantly increased with subject's age. No significant correlation was found for age-related changes in rCBV and rCBF.\nThe decrease in CP permeability is in line with the age-related changes in CSF secretion observed in animals. The MTT increase indicates significant structural changes corroborated by microscopy studies in animals or humans. Overall, DSC MR-perfusion enables an in vivo evaluation of the hemodynamic state of CP. Clinical applications such as neurodegenerative diseases could be considered thanks to specific functional studies of CP.", "journal": "Neuroradiology", "date": "2013-10-24", "authors": ["RogerBouzerar", "BaderChaarani", "CatherineGondry-Jouet", "JadwigaZmudka", "OlivierBal\u00e9dent"], "doi": "10.1007/s00234-013-1290-2"}

Several methods are being developed to stimulate revascularization of engineered tissue. Prevascularized scaffolds with a hierarchical vascular pattern, allowing surgical hook-up of the inflow and outflow tracts, that are already preseeded and cultured with primary vascular cells or precursors will be required for larger tissues or tissues with an immediate high metabolism, such as myocardium. The preimplantation presence of a mature vasculature will improve differentiation and maturation of the parenchyma, thus meeting the functional demands of the host.

The selected population included 26 male and 11 female subjects, with a mean age of 42.4 \u00b1 9.3 years (range 18-60). Magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine were obtained with a 1.5 T scanner (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a phased-array back coil. A paramagnetic non-ionic contrast agent was injected with a dose of 0.4 ml/kg. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were subsequently acquired at 5 time points, 5 and 10 minutes, 2, 4 and 6 hours after injection. Endplates presented clear enhancement already 5 minutes after injection, and showed an increase in the next 2 hours followed by a decrease. At 5 and 10 minutes, virtually no contrast medium was present inside the intervertebral disc; afterwards, enhancement significantly increased. Highly degenerated discs showed higher enhancement in comparison with low and medium degenerated discs. Discs classified as Pfirrmann 5 showed a statistically significant higher enhancement than Pfirrmann 1, 2 and 3 at all time points but the first one, possibly due to vascularization. Disc height collapse and Modic changes significantly increased enhancement. Presence of endplate defects did not show any significant influence on post contrast enhancement, but the lack of a clear classification of endplate defects as seen on magnetic resonance scans may be shadowing some effects. In conclusion, disc height, high level of degeneration and presence of Modic changes are factors which increase post contrast enhancement in the intervertebral disc.

This study demonstrates HOX-dependent differentiation of CD44(+) VW-MPSCs into SMC that involves epigenetic modification of transgelin as a down-stream regulated gene. First, HOXB7, HOXC6 and HOXC8 were identified to be differentially expressed in VW-MPSCs as compared to terminal differentiated human aortic SMC, endothelial cells and undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Silencing these HOX genes in VW-MPSCs significantly reduced their sprouting capacity and increased expression of the SMC markers transgelin and calponin and the histone gene histone H1. Furthermore, the methylation pattern of the TAGLN promoter was altered. In summary, our findings suggest a role for certain HOX genes in regulating differentiation of human VW-MPSC into SMCs that involves epigenetic mechanisms.

Despite favorable and highly encouraging early and intermediate functional outcomes, rejection of the highly immunogenic skin component of a VCA and potential adverse effects of chronic multi-drug immunosuppression continue to hamper widespread clinical application of VCA. Therefore, research in this novel field needs to focus on translational studies related to unique immunologic features of VCA and to develop novel immunomodulatory strategies for immunomodulation and tolerance induction following VCA without the need for long term immunosuppression. This article describes a reliable and reproducible translational large animal model of VCA that is comprised of an osteomyocutaneous flap in a MHC-defined swine heterotopic hind limb allotransplantation. Briefly, a well-vascularized skin paddle is identified in the anteromedial thigh region using near infrared laser angiography. The underlying muscles, knee joint, distal femur, and proximal tibia are harvested on a femoral vascular pedicle. This allograft can be considered both a VCA and a vascularized bone marrow transplant with its unique immune privileged features. The graft is transplanted to a subcutaneous abdominal pocket in the recipient animal with a skin component exteriorized to the dorsolateral region for immune monitoring. Three surgical teams work simultaneously in a well-coordinated manner to reduce anesthesia and ischemia times, thereby improving efficiency of this model and reducing potential confounders in experimental protocols. This model serves as the groundwork for future therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing and potentially eliminating the need for chronic multi-drug immunosuppression in VCA.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2013-10-23", "authors": ["ZuhaibIbrahim", "Damon SCooney", "Jaimie TShores", "Justin MSacks", "Eric GWimmers", "Steven CBonawitz", "ChadGordon", "DawnRuben", "StefanSchneeberger", "W P AndrewLee", "GeraldBrandacher"], "doi": "10.3791/50475"}
{"title": "Suppression of alkali-induced oxidative injury in the cornea by mesenchymal stem cells growing on nanofiber scaffolds and transferred onto the damaged corneal surface.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) effectively decrease alkali-induced oxidative stress in the rabbit cornea. The alkali (0.15\u00a0N NaOH) was applied on the corneas of the right eyes and then rinsed with tap water. In the first group of rabbits the injured corneas remained untreated. In the second group MSCs were applied on the injured corneal surface immediately after the injury and eyelids sutured for two days. Then the sutures were removed. In the third group nanofiber scaffolds seeded with MSCs (and in the fourth group nanofibers alone) were transferred onto the corneas immediately after the injury and the eyelids sutured. Two days later the eyelid sutures were removed together with the nanofiber scaffolds. The rabbits were sacrificed on days four, ten or fifteen after the injury, and the corneas were examined immunohistochemically, morphologically, for the central corneal thickness (taken as an index of corneal hydration) using an ultrasonic pachymeter and by real-time PCR. Results show that in untreated injured corneas the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrotyrosine (NT) (important markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress) appeared in the epithelium. The antioxidant aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1) decreased in the corneal epithelium, particularly in superficial parts, where apoptotic cell death (detected by active caspase-3) was high. (In control corneal epithelium MDA and NT are absent and ALDH3A1 highly present in all layers of the epithelium. Cell apoptosis are sporadic). In injured untreated cornea further corneal disturbances developed: The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and proinflammatory cytokines, were high. At the end of experiment (on day 15) the injured untreated corneas were vascularized and numerous inflammatory cells were present in the corneal stroma. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and number of macrophages were high. The results obtained in injured corneas covered with nanofiber scaffolds alone (without MSCs) or in injured corneas treated with MSCs only (transferred without scaffolds) did not significantly differ from the results found in untreated injured corneas. In contrast, in the injured corneas treated with MSCs on nanofiber scaffolds, ALDH3A1 expression remained high in the epithelium (as in the control cornea) and positive expression of the other immunohistochemical markers employed was very low (MMP9) or absent (NT, MDA, proinflammatory cytokines), also similarly as in the control cornea. Corneal neovascularization and the infiltration of the corneal stroma with inflammatory cells were significantly suppressed in the injured corneas treated with MSCs compared to the untreated injured ones. The increased central corneal thickness together with corneal opalescency appearing after alkali injury returned to normal levels over the course of ten days only in the injured corneas treated with MSCs on nanofiber scaffolds. The expression of genes for the proinflammatory cytokines corresponded with their immunohistochemical expression. In conclusion, MSCs on nanofiber scaffolds protected the formation of toxic peroxynitrite (detected by NT residues), lowered apoptotic cell death and decreased matrix metalloproteinase and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This resulted in reduced corneal inflammation as well as neovascularization and significantly accelerated corneal healing.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2013-10-23", "authors": ["JitkaCejkova", "PeterTrosan", "CestmirCejka", "AnnaLencova", "AlenaZajicova", "EliskaJavorkova", "SarkaKubinova", "EvaSykova", "VladimirHolan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exer.2013.10.002"}

Pharmacological inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) leads to an oxygen-independent and long-lasting activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Whereas effects of HIF-stabilization on transcriptional responses have been thoroughly investigated in endothelial cells, the molecular details of cytoskeletal changes elicited by PHD-inhibition remain largely unknown. To investigate this important aspect of PHD-inhibition, we used a spheroid-on-matrix cell culture model.\nMicrovascular endothelial cells (glEND.2) were organized into spheroids. Migration of cells from the spheroids was quantified and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The PHD inhibitor dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG) induced F-actin stress fiber formation in migrating cells, but only weakly affected microvascular endothelial cells firmly attached in a monolayer. Compared to control spheroids, the residual spheroids were larger upon PHD inhibition and contained more cells with tight VE-cadherin positive cell-cell contacts. Morphological alterations were dependent on stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 and not HIF-2\u03b1 as shown in cells with stable knockdown of HIF-\u03b1 isoforms. DMOG-treated endothelial cells exhibited a reduction of immunoreactive Rac-1 at the migrating front, concomitant with a diminished Rac-1 activity, whereas total Rac-1 protein remained unchanged. Two chemically distinct Rac-1 inhibitors mimicked the effects of DMOG in terms of F-actin fiber formation and orientation, as well as stabilization of residual spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylation of p21-activated kinase PAK downstream of Rac-1 was reduced by DMOG in a HIF-1\u03b1-dependent manner. Stabilization of cell-cell contacts associated with decreased Rac-1 activity was also confirmed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\nOur data demonstrates that PHD inhibition induces HIF-1\u03b1-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling in endothelial cells, which is mediated essentially by a reduction in Rac-1 signaling.", "journal": "Cell communication and signaling : CCS", "date": "2013-10-23", "authors": ["AlexanderWeidemann", "JohannesBreyer", "MargotRehm", "Kai-UweEckardt", "ChristophDaniel", "IwonaCicha", "KlaudiaGiehl", "MargareteGoppelt-Struebe"], "doi": "10.1186/1478-811X-11-80\n10.1093/cvr/cvq045\n10.1038/nm0603-677\n10.1038/emboj.2012.125\n10.1038/cdd.2008.12\n10.1038/cdd.2008.10\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.020\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01030.x\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.04.010\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e3283307be8\n10.2174/156652411795243414\n10.3109/15376516.2012.673088\n10.2174/157016111795495602\n10.1039/c1cs15032d\n10.1002/jor.20886\n10.1097/FJC.0b013e3181e2bfef\n10.1016/j.nbd.2011.10.020\n10.1152/ajpheart.01038.2008\n10.1016/j.bcp.2011.12.012\n10.1016/j.mvr.2008.09.012\n10.1093/cvr/cvq086\n10.1152/ajplung.00309.2005\n10.1016/j.exer.2011.03.005\n10.1152/ajpheart.00970.2010\n10.1074/jbc.M205863200\n10.1074/jbc.M109.049650\n10.1038/cdd.2008.17\n10.1073/pnas.0307512101\n10.1074/jbc.M703571200\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.08.006\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.214106\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.109.196071\n10.1182/blood-2008-12-193581\n10.1007/s00018-007-7008-z\n10.1152/ajpcell.00057.2010\n10.1074/jbc.M511408200\n10.1083/jcb.200503152\n10.1074/jbc.M100677200\n10.1093/cvr/cvt075\n10.1016/j.abb.2012.04.019\n10.1096/fj.07-096438\n10.1007/s00109-009-0482-z\n10.1681/ASN.2010010116\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2012.07.005\n10.1152/ajprenal.00153.2010\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.005\n10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2009.04.034\n10.1002/biot.200700228\n10.1681/ASN.2007040419\n10.1242/jcs.00679"}

To meet this goal, 2-N,6-O-sulfated chitosan (26SCS) based nanoparticle (S-NP) was successfully developed and showed a dose-dependent enhancement on angiogenesis in vitro. For the repair of a critical sized defect in rabbit radius, we developed BMP-2 loaded S-NP (BMP-2/S-NP) with protein loading efficiency of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2% and fabricated a gelatin sponge (G) based implant loaded with BMP-2/S-NP (BMP-2/S-NP/G).

The in vitro ALP assay revealed that the activity of released BMP-2 from BMP-2/S-NP/G was maintained after 3-d and 7-d delivery and further enhanced after 14-d delivery compared with the original BMP-2. Furthermore, the in vivo effects of BMP-2/S-NP/G on the bone regeneration and vessel formation in the critical sized defect (18 mm) of rabbit radius were investigated by synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SR\u03bcCT) imaging, three dimensional micro-computed tomographic (\u03bcCT) imaging, histological analysis, immunohistochemistry and biomechanical measurement. Based on the results, both peripheral vessel and new vessel formation were significantly increased by the BMP-2/S-NP/G treatment, along with the bridged defects at as early as 2 weeks, the healed defects at 8 weeks and the reunion of bone marrow cavity at 12 weeks. The results indicated that both controlled release of active BMP-2 and favorable vascularization at the defect site contributed by BMP-2/S-NP/G played a crucial role in accelerating and promoting bone augmentation.

{"title": "Endothelial cells do not arise from tumor-initiating cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Conventional models of carcinogenesis suggest that tumors recruit blood vessel formation from normal host tissues. This concept has recently been challenged by prominent studies of glioblastoma, which suggest that intratumoral endothelial cells (ECs) may arise from cancer stem cells/tumor-initiating cells (TICs). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common, highly vascularized tumor with few effective therapies, against which anti-angiogenic strategies are being actively explored. TICs are felt to play a role in HCC pathobiology, but their contributions to tumor vasculature have not been studied.\nWe examined human HCCs in settings that selected for tumor formation from functionally defined TICs, and in which the origin of intratumoral ECs from TICs as opposed to host tissues could be clearly distinguished. We generated HCC nodules in the livers of immunodeficient mice by intrasplenic injection of HCC cells from cell lines and patient specimens and studied the tumor ECs by immunohistochemistry for mouse and human markers. We then used immunohistochemistry for EC markers in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for X and Y chromosomes to study the endothelium of recurrent HCC specimens resected from sex-mismatched liver allografts of patients who had undergone liver transplantation for HCC.\nWe observed that all ECs in intrahepatic human HCC xenografts expressed mouse rather than human CD31. FISH analysis of recurrent HCCs resected from patients with sex-mismatched liver allografts revealed that all CD31+ and CD34+ intratumoral ECs originated from the donor allograft rather than the tumor.\nThese observations suggest that the vasculature of human HCC arises from normal host tissues rather than from TICs, supporting ongoing efforts to target angiogenesis in HCC as it is currently understood, and suggesting that the contribution of TICs to the vasculature of other cancers is disease-specific.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2013-10-22", "authors": ["AnandGhanekar", "SharifAhmed", "KuiChen", "OyedeleAdeyi"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-13-485\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1002/stem.650\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1038/nature09624\n10.1053/j.gastro.2007.04.061\n10.1002/hep.20933\n10.1056/NEJMoa0708857\n10.1586/egh.13.3\n10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.008\n10.1053/j.gastro.2007.04.025\n10.1053/j.gastro.2008.12.004\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.013\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.06.005\n10.1371/journal.pone.0039294\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e31820508f1\n10.1111/j.1440-1827.1996.tb03544.x\n10.1126/science.1142596\n10.2165/00002018-200023020-00002\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2012.120"}

This article reviews recent studies on VHL clinical findings, genetics and tumorigenesis.\nLiterature review of articles on VHL genetics with correlation to clinical findings.\nGenotype-phenotype correlation studies show that patients with a complete deletion mutation of the VHL gene, relative to participants with a missense or protein-truncating mutation, had better visual acuity and decreased tumorigenesis incidence of retinal hemangioblastomas. It has also been documented that higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia induced factor (HIF), and ubiquitin are found in ocular hemangioblastomas. The stromal foamy vacuolated cells seem to be the true tumor cells of the disease acting on the surrounding endothelial cells in ocular hemangioblastomas. Tumor cells and ocular lesions have shown increased levels of Erythropoietin (Epo), Epo receptor (EpoR), and CD133. Also, CXCR4, a CXC chemokine receptor, is expressed in retinal VHL hemangioblastomas. Recent studies suggest that the VHL mutation alone may not be sufficient to develop VHL-associated neoplasms. Studies suggest that targeting various proteins along with anti-angiogenesis molecules may be a better therapeutic approach than targeting VEGF alone.\nUnderstanding of the mechanisms and genetics underlying VHL and its associated retinal hemangioblastomas has increased substantially in recent years.

{"title": "Postischemic revascularization: from cellular and molecular mechanisms to clinical applications.", "abstract": "After the onset of ischemia, cardiac or skeletal muscle undergoes a continuum of molecular, cellular, and extracellular responses that determine the function and the remodeling of the ischemic tissue. Hypoxia-related pathways, immunoinflammatory balance, circulating or local vascular progenitor cells, as well as changes in hemodynamical forces within vascular wall trigger all the processes regulating vascular homeostasis, including vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and collateral growth, which act in concert to establish a functional vascular network in ischemic zones. In patients with ischemic diseases, most of the cellular (mainly those involving bone marrow-derived cells and local stem/progenitor cells) and molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of vessel growth and vascular remodeling are markedly impaired by the deleterious microenvironment characterized by fibrosis, inflammation, hypoperfusion, and inhibition of endogenous angiogenic and regenerative programs. Furthermore, cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, and aging, constitute a deleterious macroenvironment that participates to the abrogation of postischemic revascularization and tissue regeneration observed in these patient populations. Thus stimulation of vessel growth and/or remodeling has emerged as a new therapeutic option in patients with ischemic diseases. Many strategies of therapeutic revascularization, based on the administration of growth factors or stem/progenitor cells from diverse sources, have been proposed and are currently tested in patients with peripheral arterial disease or cardiac diseases.

We studied the consequences of K14-driven overexpression of the thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1)-like domain, and also the roles of the three collagen XVIII isoforms in mice specifically lacking either the promoter 1-derived short or the promoter 2-derived medium/long isoforms.\nTwo transgenic lines were generated and compared to Col18a1(-/-) and promoter 1 and 2 knockouts. Enucleated eyes were analyzed histopathologically, immunohistochemically, biochemically, and ultrastructurally. IOP was measured by noninvasive tonometry, and the anterior chamber was studied in vivo using a slit-lamp and optical coherence tomography.\nOverexpression of the Tsp-1 transgene in an FVB/N background resulted in increased axial length, and substantial incidences of cataract, lens subluxation, phthisis, retinal ablation, corneal vascularization, and intraocular hemorrhages. The FVB/N Col18a1(-/-) mice were affected similarly. The findings in the knockout and transgenic lines were milder in a C57BL/6JOlaHsd (B6) background. Studies with the promoter-specific knockouts revealed the short isoform as the sole variant in the lens capsule and inner limiting membrane, while the ciliary body, iris, and Bruch's membrane contained short and medium/long isoforms. Lack of the short isoform, but not of the medium/long isoforms, caused aberrant retinal vascularization.\nAn excess of the collagen XVIII Tsp-1 domain is deleterious in the eye, possibly by impairing certain functions of the full-length molecule.

{"title": "Rapid in vitro derivation of endothelium directly from human cancer cells.", "abstract": "The development of an independent blood supply by a tumor is essential for maintaining growth beyond a certain limited size and for providing a portal for metastatic dissemination. Host-derived endothelial cells (ECs) residing in and compromising the tumor vasculature originate via distinct processes known as sprouting angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. More recently ECs originating directly from the tumor cells themselves have been described although the basis for this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Here we describe in vitro conditions that allow lung and ovarian cancer cells to undergo a rapid and efficient transition into ECs that are indistinguishable from those obtained in vivo. A variety of methods were used to establish that the acquired phenotypes and behaviors of these tumor-derived ECs (TDECs) closely resemble those of authentic ECs.

No significant differences were recorded concerning the size of arterial-perforator between the two groups; however the size of venous-perforator was significantly larger in group-B (P < 0.05). In group-A, four flaps showed vascular compromise intraoperative that was salvaged by flap supercharge with the superficial inferior epigastric system. In contrast, in group-B, all flaps were re-vascularized uneventfully (P < 0.05).

{"title": "Enhanced intestinal anastomotic healing with gelatin hydrogel incorporating basic fibroblast growth factor.", "abstract": "Anastomotic leakage is a common complication of intestinal surgery. In an attempt to resolve this issue, a promising approach is enhancement of anastomotic wound healing. A method for controlled release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) using a gelatin hydrogel was developed with the objective of investigating the effects of this technology on intestinal anastomotic healing. The small intestine of Wistar rats was cut, end-to-end anastomosis was performed and rats were divided into three groups: bFGF group (anastomosis wrapped with a hydrogel sheet incorporating bFGF), PBS group (wrapped with a sheet incorporating phosphate-buffered saline solution) and NT group (no additional treatment). Degradation profiles of gelatin hydrogels in vivo and histological examinations were performed using gelatin hydrogels with various water contents and bFGF concentrations to define the optimal bFGF dose and hydrogel biodegradability. The anastomotic wound healing process was evaluated by histological examinations, adhesion-related score and bursting pressure. The optimal water content of the hydrogel and bFGF dose was determined as 96% and 30 \u00b5g per sheet, respectively. Application of bFGF significantly enhanced neovascularization, fibroblast infiltration and collagen production around the anastomotic site when compared with the other groups. Bursting pressure was significantly increased in the bFGF group. No significant difference was observed in the adhesion-related score among the groups and no anastomotic obstruction and leakage were observed. Therefore controlled release of bFGF enhanced healing of an intestinal anastomosis during the early postoperative period and is a promising method to suppress anastomotic leakage.

Past studies had shown that Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant genes lead to overactivation of mTOR in the regulating pathways in developing fetus. We used conditional Cre-loxp gene knockout approach to delete Tsc1 in mice's endothelial cells in our experimental models. Similarly, activation of mTOR signaling in endothelial cells of these embryos (Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-)) was found. Majority of Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-) embryos died at embryonic day 14.5 in utero. Cardiovascular defects, subcutaneous edema and hemorrhage were present among them. Whole-mount immunostaining in these embryos revealed a disorganized vascular network, defective sprouting of vessels in yolk sac and thickening of the labyrinth layer in the placenta. A thinner ventricular wall with disorganized trabeculae was present in the hearts of Tie2-Cre/Tsc1(-/-) embryos. Endothelial cells in Tsc1-deficient mice showed defective mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticular morphology, but no significant change was observed in cell junctions. The mutant embryos displayed significantly reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and disturbed expression of angiogenic factors. A cohort of mice was treated prenatally with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. The offspring of these mutant mice survived up to 22 days after birth. It was concluded that physiological TSC1-mTOR signaling in endothelial cells is crucial for vascular development and embryogenesis. We postulated that disruption of normal angiogenic pathways through hyperactive mTOR signaling maybe the mechanism that lead to deranged vascular pathogenesis in the tuberous sclerosis complex.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2013-10-17", "authors": ["AipingMa", "LianmeiWang", "YunzhouGao", "ZaiChang", "HaiyongPeng", "NiZeng", "Yao-SongGui", "XinlunTian", "XueLi", "BaiqiangCai", "HongbingZhang", "Kai-FengXu"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddt456"}
{"title": "Proangiogenic microtemplated fibrin scaffolds containing aprotinin promote improved wound healing responses.", "abstract": "Survival of tissue engineered constructs after implantation depends heavily on induction of a vascular response in host tissue, promoting a quick anastomosis of the cellular graft. Additionally, implanted constructs typically induce fibrous capsule formation, effectively preventing graft integration with host tissue. Previously we described the development of a high density microtemplated fibrin scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering applications with tunable degradation and mechanical properties which promoted seeded cell survival and organization in vitro (Thomson et al., Tissue Eng Part A, 2013). Scaffold degradation in vitro was controllable by addition of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and/or the fibrin cross-linker Factor XIII (FXIII). The goal of this study was to assess host tissue responses to these fibrin scaffold formulations by determining effects on scaffold degradation, angiogenic responses, and fibrous capsule formation in a subcutaneous implant model. Aprotinin significantly decreased scaffold degradation over 2\u00a0weeks of implantation. A significant increase in capillary infiltration of aprotinin implants was found after 1 and 2\u00a0weeks, with a significantly greater amount of capillaries reaching the interior of aprotinin scaffolds. Interestingly, after 2\u00a0weeks the aprotinin scaffolds had a significantly thinner, yet apparently more cellular fibrous capsule than unmodified scaffolds. These results indicate aprotinin not only inhibits fibrin scaffold degradation, but also induces significant responses in the host tissue. These included an angiogenic response resulting in increased vascularization of the scaffold material over a relatively short period of time. In addition, aprotinin release from scaffolds may reduce fibrous capsule formation, which could help promote improved integration of cell-seeded scaffolds with host tissue.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2013-10-16", "authors": ["Kassandra SThomson", "Sarah KDupras", "Charles EMurry", "MartaScatena", "MichaelRegnier"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-013-9388-z"}

It is known that DDAVP can inhibit progression of residual metastatic cells and also improves chemotherapy effects in preclinical breast cancer models. Here, we explored the effects of DDAVP on tumor angiogenesis using the aggressive F3II mammary carcinoma in syngeneic Balb/c mice. Intravenous administration of the compound (2 \u03bcg/kg) markedly decreased vascularization of growing subcutaneous tumors, as well as inhibited the early angiogenic response around intradermal inoculation sites. In vitro studies confirmed the presence of vasopressin V2 receptors on F3II cells and a modest antiproliferative activity of DDAVP. Interestingly, conditioned media from F3II monolayers exposed to low doses of DDAVP (100 nM) significantly increased angiostatin formation in the presence of purified plasminogen. Such increase was associated with an enhancement of tumor-secreted urokinase-type plasminogen activator, suggesting the proteolytic conversion of plasminogen to angiostatin in vitro. Similar results were observed with the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma, a cell line known to express the vasopressin V2 receptor. No direct effects of DDAVP (100 nM\u20131 \u03bcM) were found on capillary-like tube formation by human microvascular cells HMVEC.

{"title": "Calcitriol reduces thrombospondin-1 and increases vascular endothelial growth factor in breast cancer cells: implications for tumor angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Calcitriol, a potent antineoplastic vitamin D metabolite, inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and slows the growth of tumors. Calcitriol also may exert either antiangiogenic or proangiogenic effects depending on the tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombospondin-1 (Tsp-1) are key factors involved in promoting and inhibiting angiogenesis, respectively. The effects of calcitriol on Tsp-1 have not been studied in the mammary gland, while VEGF regulation is not clear, since opposite outcomes have been demonstrated. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of calcitriol on VEGF and Tsp-1 expression in primary breast tumor-derived cells and a panel of established breast cancer cell lines. In vivo studies in athymic mice were also performed in order to gain further insight into the biological effects of calcitriol on angiogenesis. Real time-PCR and ELISA analyses showed that calcitriol stimulated VEGF mRNA expression and protein secretion while elicited the opposite effect on Tsp-1 in 7 out of 8 cell lines studied, independently of the cell phenotype (P<0.05 in n=5). In vivo, calcitriol significantly inhibited the relative tumoral volume after 4 weeks of treatment; however, serum VEGF was higher in calcitriol-treated animals compared to controls (P<0.05). The integrated fluorescence intensity analysis of CD31, a vessel marker, showed that xenografted breast cancer cells developed tumors with similar vascular density regardless of the treatment. Nevertheless, larger necrotic areas were observed in the tumors of calcitriol-treated mice compared to controls. Since the antineoplastic activity of calcitriol has been consistently demonstrated in several studies including this one, our results suggest that the antitumoral effect of calcitriol in vivo involve different mechanisms not necessarily related to the inhibition of tumor vascularization. Overall, our findings indicate that calcitriol can impact the angiogenic process in breast cancer by regulating VEGF and Tsp-1 expression.

{"title": "Chemical sintering generates uniform porous hyaluronic acid hydrogels.", "abstract": "The implantation of scaffolds for tissue repair has achieved only limited success due primarily to the inability to achieve vascularization within the construct. Many strategies have therefore moved to incorporate pores into the scaffolds to encourage rapid cellular infiltration and subsequent vascular ingrowth. We utilized an efficient chemical sintering technique to create a uniform network of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres for porous hyaluronic acid hydrogel formation. The porous hydrogels generated from chemical sintering possessed pore uniformity and interconnectivity comparable to the commonly used non- and heat sintering techniques. Moreover, a similar cell response to the porous hydrogels generated from each sintering approach was observed in cell viability, spreading and proliferation in vitro, as well as cellular invasion in vivo. We propose chemical sintering of PMMA microspheres using a dilute acetone solution as an alternative method to generate porous hyaluronic acid hydrogels since it requires equal or 10-fold less processing time as the currently used non-sintering or heat sintering technique, respectively.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-10-15", "authors": ["CynthiaCam", "TatianaSegura"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.10.002"}

Considering the intricate connection between osteogenesis and angiogenesis, it is not surprising that communication between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is one of the most important cellular interactions that orchestrates bone formation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of co-cultured bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in angiogenesis and osteogenesis in\u00a0vitro.\nMSCs and BM-EPCs were isolated from bone marrow of dogs' iliac crest using density gradient centrifugation combined with adhesion method and identified with surface markers, cell proliferation and immunocytochemistry in\u00a0vitro. We used the direct contact method of MSCs and BM-EPCs in a co-culture system. Co-cultured cells and non-co-cultured cells were examined using the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, matrix mineralization assay, Matrigel 2D assay and gene expression.\nALP activity and calcification of nodules significantly increased in the co-cultured cells compared with MSCs alone after day 3, and tubulogenic activity of the co-cultured cells was also higher than BM-EPCs alone. Expression of bone and angiogenic markers were enhanced beyond expression levels of MSCs and BM-EPCs cultured alone.\nBM-EPCs co-cultured with MSCs can promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

We characterized the immunomodulatory properties of syngeneic (derived from the recipient strain) adipocyte-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and investigated their potential to induce VCA tolerance in rats.\nADSCs were isolated from Lewis (LEW, RT1A(l)) rats; their immunomodulatory properties were evaluated by means of mixed lymphocyte reactions in vitro and VCAs in vivo across a full major histocompatibility complex mismatch with the use of Brown-Norway (BN, RT1A(n)) donor rats. Two control and four experimental groups were designed to evaluate treatment effects of ADSCs and transient immunosuppressants (anti-lymphocyte globulin, cyclosporine) with or without low-dose (200 cGy) total body irradiation. Flow cytometry was performed to quantify levels of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs).\nCultured syngeneic ADSCs exhibited CD90.1(+)CD29(+)CD73(+)CD45(-)CD79a(-)CD11b/c(-) phenotype and the plasticity to differentiate to adipocytes and osteocytes. ADSCs dramatically suppressed proliferation of LEW splenocytes against BN antigen and mitogen, respectively, in a dose-dependent fashion, culminating in abrogation of allo- and mitogen-stimulated proliferation at the highest concentration tested. Accordingly, one infusion of syngeneic ADSCs markedly prolonged VCA survival in LEW recipients treated with transient immunosuppression; of these, 66% developed tolerance. Total body irradiation provided no additional VCA survival benefit. An important role for Tregs in tolerance induction/maintenance was suggested in vivo and in vitro.\nTreatment comprising syngeneic ADSCs and transient immunosuppression (i) increased levels of circulating Tregs and (ii) induced tolerance in 66% of recipients of major histocompatibility complex-mismatched VCAs.", "journal": "Cytotherapy", "date": "2013-10-15", "authors": ["Hui-YunCheng", "NicolaeGhetu", "Wei-ChaoHuang", "Yen-LingWang", "Christopher GlennWallace", "Chih-JenWen", "Hung-ChangChen", "Ling-YiShih", "Chih-FanLin", "Shiaw-MinHwang", "Shuen-KueiLiao", "Fu-ChanWei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcyt.2013.06.020"}

{"title": "Role of equilibrative adenosine transporters and adenosine receptors as modulators of the human placental endothelium in gestational diabetes mellitus.", "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a diseases that alters human placenta macro and microvascular reactivity as a result of endothelial dysfunction. The human placenta is a highly vascularized organ which lacks innervation, so blood flux is governed by locally released vasoactive molecules, including the endogenous nucleoside adenosine and the free radical nitric oxide (NO). Altered adenosine metabolism and uptake by the endothelium leads to increased NO synthesis which then turns-off the expression of genes coding for a family of nucleoside membrane transporters belonging to equilibrative nucleoside transporters, particularly isoforms 1 (hENT1) and 2 (hENT2). This mechanism leads to increased extracellular adenosine and, as a consequence, activation of adenosine receptors to further sustain a tonic activation of NO synthesis. This is a phenomenon that seems operative in the placental macro and microvascular endothelium in GDM. We here summarize the findings available in the literature regarding these mechanisms in the human feto-placental circulation.

Consequently, the endothelin (ET) receptor offers a molecular target for the visualization of the endothelin system in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). We therefore endeavoured to develop a subtype-selective ETA receptor (ETAR) radioligand by introduction of a glycosyl moiety as a hydrophilic building block into the lead compound PD156707. Employing click chemistry we synthesized the triazolyl conjugated fluoroglucosyl derivative 1 that had high selectivity for ETAR (4.5 nM) over ETBR (1.2 \u03bcM). The radiosynthesis of the glycoconjugate [(18)F]1 was achieved by concomitant (18)F-labeling and glycosylation, providing [(18)F]1 in high radiochemical yields (20-25%, not corrected for decay, 70 min) and a specific activity of 41-138 GBq/\u03bcmol. Binding properties of [(18)F]1 were evaluated in vitro, and its biodistribution was measured in K1 thyroid carcinoma xenograft nude mice ex vivo and by molecular imaging. Although the very substantial excretion via hepatobiliary clearance was not decisively influenced by glycosylation, the (18)F-glycoconjugate was more stable in blood during PET recordings than was the previously described (18)F-fluoroethoxy analog. Small-animal PET imaging showed displacable binding of [(18)F]1 at ETAR in K1 tumors.

Despite many reports describing functional cell differentiation, no studies have succeeded in generating a three-dimensional vascularized organ such as liver. Here we show the generation of vascularized and functional human liver from human iPSCs by transplantation of liver buds created in vitro (iPSC-LBs). Specified hepatic cells (immature endodermal cells destined to track the hepatic cell fate) self-organized into three-dimensional iPSC-LBs by recapitulating organogenetic interactions between endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Immunostaining and gene-expression analyses revealed a resemblance between in vitro grown iPSC-LBs and in vivo liver buds. Human vasculatures in iPSC-LB transplants became functional by connecting to the host vessels within 48 hours. The formation of functional vasculatures stimulated the maturation of iPSC-LBs into tissue resembling the adult liver. Highly metabolic iPSC-derived tissue performed liver-specific functions such as protein production and human-specific drug metabolism without recipient liver replacement. Furthermore, mesenteric transplantation of iPSC-LBs rescued the drug-induced lethal liver failure model. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a functional human organ from pluripotent stem cells.

{"title": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts derive from mesothelial cells via mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in peritoneal metastasis.", "abstract": "Peritoneal dissemination is a frequent metastatic route for cancers of the ovary and gastrointestinal tract. Tumour cells metastasize by attaching to and invading through the mesothelial cell (MC) monolayer that lines the peritoneal cavity. Metastases are influenced by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a cell population that derives from different sources. Hence, we investigated whether MCs, through mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT), were a source of CAFs during peritoneal carcinomatosis and whether MMT affected the adhesion and invasion of tumour cells. Biopsies from patients with peritoneal dissemination revealed the presence of myofibroblasts expressing mesothelial markers in the proximity of carcinoma implants. Prominent new vessel formation was observed in the peritoneal areas harbouring tumour cells when compared with tumour-free regions. The use of a mouse model of peritoneal dissemination confirmed the myofibroblast conversion of MCs and the increase in angiogenesis at places of tumour implants. Treatment of omentum MCs with conditioned media from carcinoma cell cultures resulted in phenotype changes reminiscent of MMT. Adhesion experiments demonstrated that MMT enhanced the binding of cancer cells to MCs in a \u03b21-integrin-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy imaging showed that the enhanced adhesion was mostly due to increased cell-cell interaction and not to a mere matrix exposure. Invasion assays suggested a reciprocal stimulation of the invasive capacity of tumour cells and MCs. Our results demonstrate that CAFs can derive from mesothelial cells during peritoneal metastasis. We suggest that MMT renders the peritoneum more receptive for tumour cell attachment/invasion and contributes to secondary tumour growth by promoting its vascularization.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2013-10-12", "authors": ["PilarSandoval", "Jose AntonioJim\u00e9nez-Heffernan", "\u00c1ngelaRynne-Vidal", "Mar\u00eda LuisaP\u00e9rez-Lozano", "\u00c1lvaroGilsanz", "VicenteRuiz-Carpio", "RaquelReyes", "JulioGarc\u00eda-Bordas", "KonstantinosStamatakis", "JavierDotor", "Pedro LMajano", "ManuelFresno", "CarlosCaba\u00f1as", "ManuelL\u00f3pez-Cabrera"], "doi": "10.1002/path.4281"}

{"title": "Automated quantification of retinal arteriovenous nicking from colour fundus images.", "abstract": "Retinal arteriovenous nicking (AV nicking) is the phenomenon where the venule is compressed or decreases in its caliber at both sides of an arteriovenous crossing. Recent research suggests that retinal AVN is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke. In this article, we propose a computer method for assessing the severity level of AV nicking of an artery-vein (AV) crossing in color retinal images. The vascular network is first extracted using a method based on multi-scale line detection. A trimming process is then performed to isolate the main vessels from unnecessary structures such as small branches or imaging artefact. Individual segments of each vessel are then identified and the vein is recognized through an artery-vein identification process. A vessel width measurement method is devised to measure the venular caliber along its two segments. The vessel width measurements of each venular segment is then analyzed and assessed separately and the final AVN index of a crossover is computed as the most severity of its two segments. The proposed technique was validated on 69 AV crossover points of varying AV nicking levels extracted from retinal images of the Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES). The results show that the computed AVN values are highly correlated with the manual grading with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.70. This has demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed method and the feasibility to develop a computer method for automatic AV nicking detection. The quantitative measurements provided by the system may help to establish a more reliable link between AV nicking and known systemic and eye diseases, which deserves further examination and exploration.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

To avoid excessive dose of x-ray irradiation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proposed. In such a case, a simple ferromagnetic sphere placed at the tip of the catheter could be used. However, due to the artifact created by the ferromagnetic core, it becomes impossible to gather an image of the tissues surrounding such a marker. Hence, in this paper we propose replacing the ferromagnetic marker with a microchip containing a coil and a photovoltaic cell. By radiating light to the photovoltaic cell, the coil generates a magnetic field which is detected as an artifact in MR images. By turning off the light, the effect of the coil is eliminated allowing images of tissues next to the marker to be taken.

{"title": "Enhanced autophagy blocks angiogenesis via degradation of gastrin-releasing peptide in neuroblastoma cells.", "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is characterized by florid vascularization leading to rapid tumor dissemination to distant organs; angiogenesis contributes to tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes. We have previously demonstrated an increased expression of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor, GRPR, in neuroblastoma and that GRP activates the PI3K-AKT pathway as a proangiogenic factor during tumor progression. Interestingly, AKT activation phosphorylates MTOR, a critical negative regulator of autophagy, a cellular process involved in the degradation of key proteins. We hypothesize that inhibition of GRPR enhances autophagy-mediated degradation of GRP and subsequent inhibition of angiogenesis in neuroblastoma. Here, we demonstrated a novel phenomenon where targeting GRPR using shRNA or a specific antagonist, RC-3095, decreased GRP secretion by neuroblastoma cells and tubule formation by endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, shGRPR or RC-3095 treatment enhanced expression of proautophagic proteins in human neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-C, and BE(2)-M17. Interestingly, rapamycin, an inhibitor of MTOR, enhanced the expression of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II and GRP was localized within LC3-II-marked autophagosomes in vitro as well as in vivo, indicating autophagy-mediated degradation of GRP. Moreover, overexpression of ATG5 or BECN1 attenuated GRP secretion and tubule formation, whereas opposite effects were observed with siRNA silencing of ATG5 and BECN1. Our data supported the role of autophagy in the degradation of GRP and subsequent inhibition of angiogenesis. Therefore, activation of autophagy may lead to novel antivascular therapeutic strategies in the treatment of highly vascular neuroblastomas.", "journal": "Autophagy", "date": "2013-10-11", "authors": ["Kwang WoonKim", "PrithaPaul", "JingboQiao", "SoraLee", "Dai HChung"], "doi": "10.4161/auto.25987\n10.1038/nrc1014\n10.1038/70928\n10.1097/00000658-200205000-00003\n10.1016/j.canlet.2007.02.007\n10.1073/pnas.0711861105\n10.1074/jbc.M502876200\n10.1074/jbc.M607094200\n10.1038/nrc1738\n10.1002/path.2697\n10.4161/auto.6.7.13306\n10.4161/auto.7.8.15598\n10.1016/j.arr.2009.06.002\n10.1247/csf.23.33\n10.4161/auto.6.5.12112\n10.1074/jbc.273.7.3963\n10.1074/jbc.270.5.2320\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208581\n10.1074/jbc.M804203200\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208715\n10.1083/jcb.152.4.657"}

The capacities of ADSCs can be further enhanced by treatment with 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2). Therefore, we hypothesized that E2 may promote the potential of ADSCs for AFT. In this study, ADSCs were extracted from three female patients by liposuction. In vitro studies showed that E2 supplementation at an optimal concentration of 10(-8) M resulted in enhanced proliferation, VEGF production, and adipogenic differentiation of human ADSCs, and reduced apoptosis rate in a serum-free environment. In addition, a nude mice model of fat transplantation was utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of ADSC for survival ratio in vivo. These results using the volume of fat tissues after 12 weeks compared original volume, revealed that the addition of E2-treated ADSCs induced a significantly higher tissue survival ratio (76.9 \u00b1 1.9%) when compared with the ADSC-free system (55.5 \u00b1 1.5%). Furthermore, increased capillary formation stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) was observed in ADSCs systems after treatment with E2. Therefore, this study demonstrated E2 could promote the capacities of ADSCs about aspects of adipogenic differentiation, growth factor secretion and apoptosis reduction in vitro, vascularization improvement in vivo, and then enhanced the survival ratio of AFT.", "journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2013-10-11", "authors": ["SaiLuo", "LijunHao", "XiangLi", "DongmeiYu", "ZhiyongDiao", "LiwenRen", "HaiqianXu"], "doi": "10.1620/tjem.231.101"}

In vitro experiments showed that cocultures of primary myoblasts and MSC undergo myogenic differentiation by stimulation with bFGF and dexamethasone. A newly developed AV-Loop model with neurotization was established in this study. It encompasses axial vascularization and the additional implantation of a motor nerve serving as myogenic stimulator.

After 8 weeks, we could observe areas of myogenic differentiation with \u03b1 -sarcomeric actin and MHC expression in the constructs. Quantitative PCR analysis showed an expression of myogenic markers in all specimens.

Our objective was to isolate clinically relevant quantities of fetal endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) from human term placenta and to compare them to the well-established donor-matched umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ECFCs. A sorting strategy was devised to enrich for CD45-CD34+CD31Lo cells prior to primary plating to obtain pure placental ECFCs (PL-ECFCs) upon culture. UCB-ECFCs were derived using a well-described assay. PL-ECFCs were fetal in origin and expressed the same cell surface markers as UCB-ECFCs. Most importantly, a single term placenta could yield as many ECFCs as 27 UCB donors. PL-ECFCs and UCB-ECFCs had similar in vitro and in vivo vessel forming capacities and restored mouse hind limb ischemia in similar proportions. Gene expression profiles were only minimally divergent between PL-ECFCs and UCB-ECFCs, probably reflecting a vascular source versus a circulating source. Finally, PL-ECFCs and UCB-ECFCs displayed similar hierarchies between high and low proliferative colonies. We report a robust strategy to isolate ECFCs from human term placentas based on their cell surface expression. This yielded much larger quantities of ECFCs than UCB, but the cells were comparable in immunophenotype, gene expression, and in vivo functional ability.

However, the transplantation outcomes at subcutaneous site have been disappointing due to hypoxia-induced oxidative stress by poor vascularization. We hypothesized that subcutaneously transplanted islets would have hypoxia resistance by using internalization of metallothionein (MT), an antioxidant scavenging enzyme, which was mediated by fusion between MT and cell penetrating Tat peptide. The Tat-MT was dose-dependently transduced into islets without any damage. Tat-MT-treated islets could be protected from oxidative stress induced by intracellular nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). When Tat-MT-treated islets were subcutaneously transplanted into diabetic nude mice, they normally controlled the blood glucose levels without severe fluctuation (median survival time (MST): >30 days), whereas most untreated islets were rejected (MST 17 days). From the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test 5 days after posttransplantation, glucose responsiveness of Tat-MT-treated islets was similar to that of normal healthy mice, while untreated islets had delayed glucose responsiveness. From the results of immunohistochemical stain, Tat-MT-treated islets had strong anti-insulin positive cells and lower anti-HIF-1\u03b1 positive cells.

Several approaches to engineer cardiac tissue in vitro have been conducted. The main drawback of these studies is the insufficient size of the resulting construct for clinical applications. The focus of this study was the generation of an artificial three-dimensional (3D), contractile, and suturable myocardial patch by combining a gel-based CC with decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), thereby engineering an artificial tissue of 11\u2009cm\u00b2 in size. The alignment and morphology of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (rCMs) in SIS-CC complexes were investigated as well as the re-organization of primary endothelial cells which were co-isolated in the rCM preparation. The ability of a rat heart endothelial cell line (RHE-A) to re-cellularize pre-existing vessel structures within the SIS or a biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM) was determined. SIS-CC contracted spontaneously, uniformly, and rhythmically with an average rate of 200 beats/min in contrast to undirected contractions observed in CC without SIS support. rCM exhibited an elongated morphology with well-defined sarcomeric structures oriented along the longitudinal axis in the SIS-CC, whereas round-shaped and random-arranged rCM were observed in CC. Electric coupling of rCM was demonstrated by microelectrode array measurements. A dense network of CD31\u207a/eNOS\u207a cells was detected as permeating the whole construct. Superficial supplementation of RHE-A cells to SIS-CC led to the migration of these cells through the CC, resulting in the re-population of pre-existing vessel structures within the decelluarized SIS. By infusion of RHE-A cells into the BioVaM venous and arterial pedicles, a re-population of the BioVaM vessel bed as well as distribution of RHE-A cells throughout the CC was achieved.

In adipose tissue reduced blood vessel density is related to hypoxia state, cell death and inflammation. Here we demonstrate that adipocytes of poorly vascularized enlarged visceral adipose tissue (i.e. adipose tissue of old mice) suffer from limited nutrient delivery. In particular, nutrient starvation elicits increased activity of mitochondrial proline oxidase/dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH) that is causal in triggering a ROS-dependent induction of ATGL. We demonstrate that ATGL promotes the expression of genes related to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1), thus setting a metabolic switch towards fat utilization that supplies energy to starved adipocytes and prevents cell death, as well as adipose tissue inflammation.

Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue plays important roles in antigen sampling and self-tolerance during infection and inflammation.\nWe reasoned that activated bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue would be evident in rats with pulmonary hypertension, and that loss of self-tolerance would result in production of pathologic autoantibodies that drive vascular remodeling.\nWe used animal models, histology, and gene expression assays to evaluate the role of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in pulmonary hypertension.\nBronchus-associated lymphoid tissue was more numerous, larger, and more active in pulmonary hypertension compared with control animals. We found dendritic cells in and around lymphoid tissue, which were composed of CD3(+) T cells over a core of CD45RA(+) B cells. Antirat IgG and plasma from rats with pulmonary hypertension decorated B cells in lymphoid tissue, resistance vessels, and adventitia of large vessels. Lymphoid tissue in diseased rats was vascularized by aquaporin-1(+) high endothelial venules and vascular cell adhesion molecule-positive vessels. Autoantibodies are produced in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and, when bound to pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts, change their phenotype to one that may promote inflammation. Passive transfer of autoantibodies into rats caused pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.

{"title": "Human adipose stem cells cell sheet constructs impact epidermal morphogenesis in full-thickness excisional wounds.", "abstract": "Among the wide range of strategies to target skin repair/regeneration, tissue engineering (TE) with stem cells at the forefront, remains as the most promising route. Cell sheet (CS) engineering is herein proposed, taking advantage of particular cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and subsequent cellular milieu, to create 3D TE constructs to promote full-thickness skin wound regeneration. Human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) CS were obtained within five days using both thermoresponsive and standard cell culture surfaces. hASCs-based constructs were then built by superimposing three CS and transplanted into full-thickness excisional mice skin wounds with delayed healing. Constructs obtained using thermoresponsive surfaces were more stable than the ones from standard cell culture surfaces due to the natural adhesive character of the respective CS. Both CS-generating strategies lead to prolonged hASCs engraftment, although no transdifferentiation phenomena were observed. Moreover, our findings suggest that the transplanted hASCs might be promoting neotissue vascularization and extensively influencing epidermal morphogenesis, mainly through paracrine actions with the resident cells. The thicker epidermis, with a higher degree of maturation characterized by the presence of rete ridges-like structures, as well as a significant number of hair follicles observed after transplantation of the constructs combining the CS obtained from the thermoresponsive surfaces, reinforced the assumptions of the influence of the transplanted hASCs and the importance of the higher stability of these constructs promoted by cohesive cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions. Overall, this study confirmed the potential of hASCs CS-based constructs to treat full-thickness excisional skin wounds and that their fabrication conditions impact different aspects of skin regeneration, such as neovascularisation, but mainly epidermal morphogenesis.", "journal": "Biomacromolecules", "date": "2013-10-08", "authors": ["M TCerqueira", "R PPirraco", "T CSantos", "D BRodrigues", "A MFrias", "A RMartins", "R LReis", "A PMarques"], "doi": "10.1021/bm4011062"}

Just like human skin recovers itself upon damage with the aid of nutrient-laden blood vascularization, designing smart materials with microvascular network to accelerate self-healing is workable but continues to be a challenge. Here we report a new strategy to prepare robust self-healing hydrogels assisted by a healing layer composed of electrospun cross-linked nanofiber networks containing redox agents. The hydrogels process high healing rate ranging from seconds to days and great mechanical strengths with storage modulus up to 0.1 MPa. More interestingly, when the healing layer is embedded into the crack of the hydrogel, accelerated self-healing is observed and the healing efficiency is about 80%. The healing layer encourages molecular diffusion as well as further cross-linking in the crack region of the hydrogel, responsible for enhanced healing efficiency.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2013-10-05", "authors": ["YuanFang", "Cai-FengWang", "Zhi-HongZhang", "HuanShao", "SuChen"], "doi": "10.1038/srep02811"}
{"title": "SLIT3-ROBO4 activation promotes vascular network formation in human engineered tissue and angiogenesis in vivo.", "abstract": "Successful implantation and long-term survival of engineered tissue grafts hinges on adequate vascularization of the implant. Endothelial cells are essential for patterning vascular structures, but they require supportive mural cells such as pericytes/mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to generate stable, functional blood vessels. While there is evidence that the angiogenic effect of MSCs is mediated via the secretion of paracrine signals, the identity of these signals is unknown. By utilizing two functionally distinct human MSC clones, we found that so-called \"pericytic\" MSCs secrete the pro-angiogenic vascular guidance molecule SLIT3, which guides vascular development by directing ROBO4-positive endothelial cells to form networks in engineered tissue. In contrast, \"non-pericytic\" MSCs exhibit reduced activation of the SLIT3/ROBO4 pathway and do not support vascular networks. Using live cell imaging of organizing 3D vascular networks, we show that siRNA knockdown of SLIT3 in MSCs leads to disorganized clustering of ECs. Knockdown of its receptor ROBO4 in ECs abolishes the generation of functional human blood vessels in an in vivo xenogenic implant. These data suggest that the SLIT3/ROBO4 pathway is required for MSC-guided vascularization in engineered tissues.

While the remarkable plasticity of perivascular cells - resembling mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) - in malignant gliomas and their contribution to angiogenesis is increasingly recognized, their role as potential mediators of immunosuppression is unknown. Here we demonstrate that FACS-sorted malignant glioma-derived pericytes (HMGP) were characterized by the expression of CD90, CD248, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2). HMGP shared this expression profile with human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) and human MSC (HMSC) but not human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC). CD90+PDGFR-\u03b2+perivascular cells distinct from CD31+ endothelial cells accumulated in human gliomas with increasing degree of malignancy and negatively correlated with the presence of blood vessel-associated leukocytes and CD8+ T cells. Cultured CD90+PDGFR-\u03b2+HBVP were equally capable of suppressing allogeneic or mitogen-activated T cell responses as human MSC. HMGP, HBVP and HMSC expressed prostaglandin E synthase (PGES), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). These factors but not indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-mediated conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine functionally contributed to immunosuppression of immature pericytes.

{"title": "Pulse propagation by a capacitive mechanism drives embryonic blood flow.", "abstract": "Pulsatile flow is a universal feature of the blood circulatory system in vertebrates and can lead to diseases when abnormal. In the embryo, blood flow forces stimulate vessel remodeling and stem cell proliferation. At these early stages, when vessels lack muscle cells, the heart is valveless and the Reynolds number (Re) is low, few details are available regarding the mechanisms controlling pulses propagation in the developing vascular network. Making use of the recent advances in optical-tweezing flow probing approaches, fast imaging and elastic-network viscous flow modeling, we investigated the blood-flow mechanics in the zebrafish main artery and show how it modifies the heart pumping input to the network. The movement of blood cells in the embryonic artery suggests that elasticity of the network is an essential factor mediating the flow. Based on these observations, we propose a model for embryonic blood flow where arteries act like a capacitor in a way that reduces heart effort. These results demonstrate that biomechanics is key in controlling early flow propagation and argue that intravascular elasticity has a role in determining embryonic vascular function.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2013-10-04", "authors": ["HalinaAnton", "SebastienHarlepp", "CarolineRamspacher", "DaveWu", "FabienMonduc", "SandeepBhat", "MichaelLiebling", "CamillePaoletti", "GillesCharvin", "Jonathan BFreund", "JulienVermot"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.096768"}

One side of each matched pair was randomly selected to undergo one of two osteotomies: (1) midpatellar osteotomy or (2) distal-pole osteotomy. For volumetric analysis, comparisons were performed between contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images and precontrast magnetic resonance images as well as between osteotomized patellar bone fragments and the corresponding intact areas on the control side. We then injected a urethane polymer compound and dissected all specimens to examine extraosseous vascularity.\nMagnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the largest arterial contribution to the patella entered at the inferior pole in 100% of the specimens; in 80% of these specimens, the artery entered inferomedially. It also revealed an overall decrease in contrast enhancement in both transverse osteotomy groups, with an average reduction in enhancement in the proximal fragment of 36%.\nIf possible, surgical interventions about the knee should be carefully planned to preserve the peripatellar ring (the source of the entire patellar blood supply), especially the inferior patellar network.

{"title": "Usage of adenovirus expressing thymidine kinase mediated hepatocellular damage for enabling mouse liver repopulation with allogenic or xenogenic hepatocytes.", "abstract": "It has been shown that the liver of immunodeficient mice can be efficiently repopulated with human hepatocytes when subjected to chronic hepatocellular damage. Mice with such chimeric livers represent useful reagents for medical and clinical studies. However all previously reported models of humanized livers are difficult to implement as they involve cross-breeding of immunodeficient mice with mice exhibiting genetic alterations causing sustained hepatic injury. In this paper we attempted to create chimeric livers by inducing persistent hepatocellular damage in immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) \u03b3c(-/-) mice using an adenovirus encoding herpes virus thymidine kinase (AdTk) and two consecutive doses of ganciclovir (GCV). We found that this treatment resulted in hepatocellular damage persisting for at least 10 weeks and enabled efficient engraftment and proliferation within the liver of either human or allogenic hepatocytes. Interestingly, while the nodules generated from the transplanted mouse hepatocytes were well vascularized, the human hepatocytes experienced progressive depolarization and exhibited reduced numbers of murine endothelial cells inside the nodules. In conclusion, AdTk/GCV-induced liver damage licenses the liver of immunodeficient mice for allogenic and xenogenic hepatocyte repopulation.

Small exposure, defined as exposure area smaller than 3 mm in diameter, was treated conservatively first with topical lubricant and prophylactic antibiotics. Larger defects were managed surgically.\nSeven patients consisting of two males and five females were successfully treated for orbital implant exposure with extraocular muscle flaps. The average age was 36.4 (range, 3-55) years old. Five patients were referred from other hospitals. One eye was enucleated for retinoblastoma. The other six eyes were eviscerated, including one for endophthalmitis and five for trauma. Mean follow-up time of all seven patients was 19.5 (range, 2-60) months. No patient developed recurrence of exposure during follow-up. All patients were fitted with an acceptable prosthesis and had satisfactory cosmetic and functional results.\nThe most common complication of orbital implant is exposure, caused by breakdown of the covering layers, leading to extrusion. Several methods were reported to manage the exposed implants.

Angiogenesis is required for normal tissue function, but, under conditions of stress, inappropriate vascularization can lead to disease. Therefore, inhibition of angiogenic sprouting may prevent neovascularization in patients with blinding neovascular eye diseases, including macular degeneration. VEGF antagonists have therapeutic benefits but also can elicit off-target effects. Here, we found that the Ras pathway, which functions downstream of a wide range of cytokines including VEGF, is active in the growing vascular front of developing and pathological vascular networks. The endogenous Ras inhibitor p120RasGAP was expressed predominately in quiescent VEGF-insensitive endothelial cells and was ectopically downregulated in multiple neovascular models. MicroRNA-132 negatively regulated p120RasGAP expression. Experimental delivery of \u03b1-miR-132 to developing mouse eyes disrupted tip cell Ras activity and prevented angiogenic sprouting.

A 66-year-old female presented with a reddish-orange elevated lesion and serous retinal detachment in the macula of her left eye, and was diagnosed as PCV. She was treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), and followed-up through routine examinations, including ICG angiography. ICG angiography at presentation showed a branching vascular network and choroidal venules with dye leakage (polypoidal vessels) in the left eye. Pulsations, supposedly of venous origin, were observed at an A-V crossing in the abnormal vessels. Within 3 months after PDT, the polypoidal vessel ceased to leak and the pulsations vanished. The reddish-orange lesion gradually decreased in size with complete disappearance of retinal detachment.

{"title": "Trichome structure and evolution in Neotropical lianas.", "abstract": "Trichomes are epidermal outgrowths generally associated with protection against herbivores and/or desiccation that are widely distributed from ferns to angiosperms. Patterns of topological variation and morphological evolution of trichomes are still scarce in the literature, preventing valid comparisons across taxa. This study integrates detailed morphoanatomical data and the evolutionary history of the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) in order to gain a better understanding of current diversity and evolution of trichome types.\nTwo sampling schemes were used to characterize trichome types: (1) macromorphological characterization of all 105 species currently included in Bignonieae; and (2) micromorphological characterization of 16 selected species. Individual trichome morphotypes were coded as binary in each vegetative plant part, and trichome density and size were coded as multistate. Ancestral character state reconstructions were conducted using maximum likelihood (ML) assumptions.\nTwo main functional trichome categories were found: non-glandular and glandular. In glandular trichomes, three morphotypes were recognized: peltate (Pg), stipitate (Sg) and patelliform/cupular (P/Cg) trichomes. Non-glandular trichomes were uniseriate, uni- or multicellular and simple or branched. Pg and P/Cg trichomes were multicellular and non-vascularized with three clearly distinct cell layers. Sg trichomes were multicellular, uniseriate and long-stalked. ML ancestral character state reconstructions suggested that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Bignonieae probably had non-glandular, Pg and P/Cg trichomes, with each trichome type presenting alternative histories of appearance on the different plant parts. For example, the MRCA of Bignonieae probably had non-glandular trichomes on the stems, prophylls, petiole, petiolule and leaflet veins while P/Cg trichomes were restricted to leaflet blades. Sg trichomes were not present in the MRCA of Bignonieae independently of the position of these trichomes. These trichomes had at least eight independent origins in tribe.\nThe patterns of trichome evolution indicate that most morphotypes are probably homologous in Bignonieae and could be treated under the same name based on its morphological similarity and common evolutionary history, in spite of the plethora of names that have been previously designated in the literature. The trichome descriptions presented here will facilitate comparisons across taxa, allowing inferences on the relationsthips between trichome variants and future studies about their functional properties.", "journal": "Annals of botany", "date": "2013-10-02", "authors": ["AnselmoNogueira", "Juliana Hanna Leite ElOttra", "ElzaGuimar\u00e3es", "Silvia RodriguesMachado", "L\u00facia GLohmann"], "doi": "10.1093/aob/mct201"}
{"title": "The origin of human mesenchymal stromal cells dictates their reparative properties.", "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) from adipose cardiac tissue have attracted considerable interest in regard to cell-based therapies. We aimed to test the hypothesis that hMSCs from the heart and epicardial fat would be better cells for infarct repair.\nWe isolated and grew hMSCs from patients with ischemic heart disease from 4 locations: epicardial fat, pericardial fat, subcutaneous fat, and the right atrium. Significantly, hMSCs from the right atrium and epicardial fat secreted the highest amounts of trophic and inflammatory cytokines, while hMSCs from pericardial and subcutaneous fat secreted the lowest. Relative expression of inflammation- and fibrosis-related genes was considerably higher in hMSCs from the right atrium and epicardial fat than in subcutaneous fat hMSCs. To determine the functional effects of hMSCs, we allocated rats to hMSC transplantation 7 days after myocardial infarction. Atrial hMSCs induced greatest infarct vascularization as well as highest inflammation score 27 days after transplantation. Surprisingly, cardiac dysfunction was worst after transplantation of hMSCs from atrium and epicardial fat and minimal after transplantation of hMSCs from subcutaneous fat. These findings were confirmed by using hMSC transplantation in immunocompromised mice after myocardial infarction. Notably, there was a correlation between tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 secretion from hMSCs and posttransplantation left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction.\nBecause of their proinflammatory properties, hMSCs from the right atrium and epicardial fat of cardiac patients could impair heart function after myocardial infarction. Our findings might be relevant to autologous mesenchymal stromal cell therapy and development and progression of ischemic heart disease.", "journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "date": "2013-10-02", "authors": ["NiliNaftali-Shani", "AyeletItzhaki-Alfia", "NatalieLanda-Rouben", "DavidKain", "RadkaHolbova", "ShimritAdutler-Lieber", "NataliMolotski", "EladAsher", "AvishayGrupper", "EranMillet", "ArielTessone", "EyalWinkler", "JensKastrup", "Micha SFeinberg", "DovZipori", "MeiravPevsner-Fischer", "EhudRaanani", "JonathanLeor"], "doi": "10.1161/JAHA.113.000253"}
{"title": "Diet-induced obesity may affect the uterine immune environment in early-mid pregnancy, reducing NK-cell activity and potentially compromising uterine vascularization.", "abstract": "To investigate the effect of obesity in early-mid pregnancy on crucial pregnancy hormones and the uterine immune environment.\nObesity impacts reproductive ability, adversely affecting conception and leading to complications in pregnancy. Obesity is often regarded as a stress state and an immune disease, both of which may contribute to pregnancy failure. We previously demonstrated that stress in early pregnancy greatly alters progesterone secretion. As progesterone is an immunomodulator, altered progesterone secretion may adversely modify the maternal immune system. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that obesity during pregnancy adversely alters the uterine immune environment.\nAn obese mouse model was created by feeding C57/BL6 mice on a high-fat (HF)/sugar diet for 12 weeks before pregnancy. Control mice were fed on lower-fat/sugar chow. Mice were mated, and on day 7.5 of pregnancy plasma progesterone and prolactin were measured by immunoassay. Cells from the uterus-draining inguinal lymph nodes were collected for analysis of the uterine immune response by flow cytometry.\nDiet-induced obesity increased the secretion of progesterone and altered a number of uterine natural killer (NK)- and T-cell responses. These included a marked reduction in the percentage of leucocyte-derived NK cells and reduced expression of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in the NK cells compared with control mice.\nMaternal obesity, induced by an HF diet, may lead to a reduction in the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in NK cells. NK-cell-derived IFN-\u03b3 is reported to be involved in supporting uterine spiral artery remodelling. Thus, obesity in early pregnancy may compromise vascularization by reducing the expression of IFN-\u03b3-positive NK cells. Furthermore, the expression of uterine CD8(+) cells was reduced in the HF diet-fed mice, suggesting obesity may adversely alter the maternal immune adaptation that is essential for effective pregnancy.", "journal": "International journal of obesity (2005)", "date": "2013-10-02", "authors": ["V JParker", "M ESolano", "P CArck", "A JDouglas"], "doi": "10.1038/ijo.2013.164"}

The device was designed with perfusable microfluidic channels on the order of 100 \u03bcm to mimic small blood vessels, and high interfacial area to an adjacent parenchymal space to enable transport between the compartments. Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) elastomer was used to construct the microvessel framework, and various assembly methods were evaluated to ensure robust mechanical integrity. In vitro studies demonstrated the differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells cultured in the parenchymal space, a 90% reduction in muscle cell viability due to trans-membrane transport of a myotoxic drug from the perfusate, and microvessel seeding with human endothelial cells. In vivo studies of scaffolds implanted subcutaneously and intraperitoneally, without or with exogenous cells, into nude rats demonstrated biodegradation of the membrane interface and host blood cell infiltration of the microvessels.

{"title": "Nail anatomy.", "abstract": "The nail unit comprises the nail plate, the surrounding soft tissues, and their vasculature and innervation based upon the distal phalanx. The nail plate is a laminated keratinized structure lying on the nail matrix (15-25%), the nail bed with its distal onychodermal band (75-85%), and the hyponychium at its free edge. The distal part of the matrix, the lunula characterized by its half-moon shape, can be observed in some digits. The nail plate is embedded by the proximal and lateral folds. From the proximal nail fold, the cuticle (also known as the eponychium), adheres to the superficial surface of the proximal nail plate. The nail unit possesses a complex and abundant vascular network to ensure adequate blood supply. Finally, both the periungual soft tissues and the nail folds are innervated. The shapes, structure, and inter-relationships of these tissues are factors in the way nails present with disease and how we understand and manage those diseases. In particular, an understanding of the surgical anatomy is important for those undertaking diagnostic or curative operations on the nail.

The mean size of the proximal pole fragments was 21% (range, 9% to 28%) of the entire scaphoid, based on quantitative radiographic measurement. All patients had distal radius bone grafting based on the 1,2-intercompartmental supraretinacular artery pedicle and fixation with K-wires. There were 21 wrists in 18 men and 2 women with the mean age of 34 years (range, 22 to 57 y). The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 40 months (range, 12 to 103 mo). Radiographic union and clinical outcomes, including the ranges of wrist motion, grip strength, and the modified Mayo wrist score, were evaluated.\nUnion was achieved in 18 of 21 wrists (86%) at a mean time of 14 weeks after surgery (range, 8 to 28 wk). Nonunions with proximal fragments less than 20% of the total scaphoid healed in 6 of 8 wrists. In a subset of these 8 wrists in which the proximal fragment was less than 15%, healing occurred in 2 of 4. The modified Mayo wrist score significantly improved from 46 to 78 points, and final wrist functions were rated as excellent in 5, good in 5, fair in 10, and poor in 1. Ranges of motion and grip strengths did not show significant changes after surgery.\nVascularized distal radius bone grafting and K-wire fixation can heal scaphoid nonunions with small avascular proximal fragments, although motion and grip strength remain unchanged.

{"title": "Significance and function of different spinal collateral compartments following thoracic aortic surgery: immediate versus long-term flow compensation.", "abstract": "Iatrogenic paraplegia has been accompanying cardiovascular surgery since its beginning. As a result, surgeons have been developing many theories about the exact mechanisms of this devastating complication. Thus, the impact of single arteries that contribute to the spinal perfusion is one of the most discussed subjects in modern surgery. The subsequent decision of reattachment or the permanent disconnection of these intercostal arteries divides the surgical community. On the one hand, the anatomical or vascular approach pleads for the immediate reimplantation to reconstruct the anatomical situation. On the other hand, the decision of the permanent disconnection aims at avoiding stealing phenomenon away from the spinal vascular network. This spinal collateral network can be described as consisting of three components-the intraspinal and two paraspinal compartments-that feed the nutrient arteries of the spinal cord. The exact functional impact of the different compartments of the collateral network remains poorly understood. In this review, the function of the intraspinal compartment in the context of collateral network principle as an immediate emergency backup system is described. The exact structure and architectural principles of the intraspinal compartment are described. The critical parameters with regard to the risk of postoperative spinal cord ischaemia are the number of anterior radiculomedullary arteries (ARMAs) and the distance between them in relation to the longitudinal extent of aortic disease. The paraspinal network as a sleeping reserve is proposed as the long-term backup system. This sleeping reserve has to be activated by arteriogenic stimuli. These are presented briefly, and prior findings regarding arteriogenesis are discussed in the light of the collateral network concept. Finally, the role of preoperative visualization of the ARMAs in order to evaluate the risk of postoperative paraplegia is emphasized.", "journal": "European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery", "date": "2013-10-01", "authors": ["PhilippMeffert", "Moritz SBischoff", "RobertBrenner", "MatthiasSiepe", "FriedhelmBeyersdorf", "Fabian AKari"], "doi": "10.1093/ejcts/ezt479"}
{"title": "The role of angiogenic factors in fibroid pathogenesis: potential implications for future therapy.", "abstract": "It is well established that tumors are dependent on angiogenesis for their growth and survival. Although uterine fibroids are known to be benign tumors with reduced vascularization, recent work demonstrates that the vasculature of fibroids is grossly and microscopically abnormal. Accumulating evidence suggests that angiogenic growth factor dysregulation may be implicated in these vascular and other features of fibroid pathophysiology.\nLiterature searches were performed in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles with content related to angiogenic growth factors and myometrium/leiomyoma. The findings are hereby reviewed and discussed.\nMultiple growth factors involved in angiogenesis are differentially expressed in leiomyoma compared with myometrium. These include epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding-EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and adrenomedullin. An important paradox is that although leiomyoma tissues are hypoxic, leiomyoma feature down-regulation of key molecular regulators of the hypoxia response. Furthermore, the hypoxic milieu of leiomyoma may contribute to fibroid development and growth. Notably, common treatments for fibroids such as GnRH agonists and uterine artery embolization (UAE) are shown to work at least partly via anti-angiogenic mechanisms.\nAngiogenic growth factors play an important role in mechanisms of fibroid pathophysiology, including abnormal vasculature and fibroid growth and survival. Moreover, the fibroid's abnormal vasculature together with its aberrant hypoxic and angiogenic response may make it especially vulnerable to disruption of its vascular supply, a feature which could be exploited for treatment.

{"title": "Introducing the tibial-dorsalis pedis osteocutaneous shin flap: a new option for oromandibular reconstruction.", "abstract": "The authors investigated the possibility of incorporating a well-vascularized, partial corticotomy of the anterolateral aspect of the tibia \"in-series\" with a dorsalis pedis fasciocutaneous free flap for oromandibular reconstruction.\nA cadaveric injection study was performed to characterize the vascular territory of the anterior tibial artery with regard to the surrounding osseous and soft tissue. The two-point breaking strength of the tibia (twist) was examined with fracture strain gauge analysis to determine the threshold of tibia corticotomy that would lead to a pathologic fracture. Finally, the authors performed an in vivo prospective clinical examination of the tibial-dorsalis pedis osteocutaneous shin flap.\nThe perfusion study revealed that the anterior tibial artery provided a rich matrix of musculofascial periosteal blood supply to the anterolateral cortex of the tibia that could potentially support free osseous tibial transfer. Two-point osteotomy fracture strain gauge analysis demonstrated that the threshold of tibia corticotomy that would lead to pathologic fracture of the remaining tibia was greater than 30 percent. The osteocutaneous shin flap was performed in eight patients. The mean follow-up was 61 months. There were no cases of flap loss, salivary fistula, nonunion, or tibia pathologic fracture. All patients achieved ambulation.\nThe authors introduce the osteocutaneous tibial-dorsalis pedis free vascularized flap as a viable option for oromandibular reconstruction. Its most notable advantage is the independent mobility of the skin paddle, in combination with bone stock that replicates mandibular bone dimensions, facilitating primary osseointegration or denture rehabilitation.\nTherapeutic, IV.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2013-10-01", "authors": ["R StephenMulholland", "NeilTanna", "Peter DCostantino", "Ashley RChandler", "J BrianBoyd"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e31829fc029"}
{"title": "Urinary excretion of oxidative damage markers in a rat model of vascularized composite allotransplantation.", "abstract": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation is an emerging field of transplantation that provides a potential treatment for complex tissue defects after traumatic loss or tumor resection and for the repair of congenital abnormalities. However, vascularized composite allotransplantation recipients have suffered from acute and chronic graft rejection that is associated with oxidative stress. This study investigated the oxidative damage in a rat vascularized composite allotransplantation model by measuring three urinary biomarkers, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), and malondialdehyde.\nRats received two different immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil after transplantation, with one group also receiving mesenchymal stem cells before transplantation. Urine was collected and analyzed for 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, and malondialdehyde by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectometry methods.\nRats undergoing vascularized composite allotransplantation had higher urinary levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, and malondialdehyde compared with rats undergoing syngeneic transplantation. Cyclosporine A/mycophenolate mofetil following treatment prolonged the allograft survival in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with rats undergoing vascularized composite allotransplantation with cyclosporine A/mycophenolate mofetil treatment alone, rats undergoing mesenchymal stem cell combined treatment showed the longest allograft survival, and had approximately 50 percent lower urinary levels of malondialdehyde together with approximately 2.7-times higher levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine.\nMesenchymal stem cell combined treatment efficiently managed oxidative stress in rats undergoing vascularized composite allotransplantation, and urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine and malondialdehyde could be regarded as good responders to the mesenchymal stem cell therapy.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2013-10-01", "authors": ["Ching-HsuanHu", "Cheng-HungLin", "Nai-JenChang", "Chiung-WenHu", "Chih-HungLin"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182a0141f"}
{"title": "Development of a reliable model of total abdominal wall transplantation.", "abstract": "Among the most common complications associated with abdominal organ transplantation are issues with abdominal wall closure. This difficulty, along with the recent rise in the use of vascularized composite allotransplantation, has led surgeons to the notion of abdominal wall transplantation.\nThe authors have developed a novel surgical model for a full-thickness total abdominal wall transplant based on a unilateral pedicle between fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched rat strains. An established cuff technique was used to anastomose the donor's common iliac vessels to the recipient's femoral vessels. Three groups (n = 6 per group) received FK506 monotherapy, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg/kg per day. The transplants were assessed daily for evidence of rejection by visual inspection. Hematoxylin and eosin skin biopsies and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the recipients' peripheral blood were performed.\nNo signs of rejection were observed in the animals receiving FK506, 0.50 or 0.75 mg/kg per day. Those receiving 0.25 mg/kg per day, however, displayed a mixed rejection response.

Preoperatively, all patients had infection, irradiation, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or a combination thereof. Thirteen patients (92.9 percent) were reoperative cases for recurrent tumor, infection, or both. Six patients (42.9 percent) failed previous reconstructive procedures. Tissue biopsy-proven infection was present in 10 patients (71.4 percent) with calvarial osteomyelitis, both osteomyelitis and meningitis, or scalp soft-tissue infection only. Nine patients (64.3 percent) suffered from malignancy and six of these patients were irradiated preoperatively. Cranioplasty was achieved as part of a chimeric free flap using rib, scapula, both rib and scapula, or ilium. Vascularized duraplasty using serratus anterior fascia as a component of the chimeric flap was performed in three patients. No flap losses occurred and all patients had resolution of infection.\nSoft-tissue and skeletal restoration are the two critical components of composite cranial reconstruction.

These topics are significantly overlapped in terms of three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of cells and blood vessels. Therefore, this review focuses on neovascularization of 3-D scaffold biomaterials induced by angiogenic factors and/or cells.

Whether a lack of demand for increased myocardial vascularization and/or an impaired response of circulating angiogenic-supportive cells are responsible for the vascular derangements found in IDCM is unknown.\nLeft ventricle (LV) samples obtained at transplant from IDCM hearts were compared to control hearts from non-cardiac decedents. Peripheral colony-forming myeloid cells were extracted from age- and sex-matched IDCM patients and healthy volunteers. At the tissue level, no differences were detected in stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1\u03b1 expression, but integrin-linked kinase (ILK) levels and activity were increased in IDCM. A marked co-localization of SDF-1\u03b1 and the specific marker of cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts Flotillin (Flot)-1 was found in IDCM. SDF-1\u03b1 was also highly distributed into IDCM lipid rafts. Non-adherent pro-angiogenic cells from both groups, which were found increased in patients but showed similar surface levels of CXCR-4, equally supported Matrigel-mediated cell network formation. However, SDF-1-mediated migration was reduced in IDCM-derived cells, which also exhibited decreased ILK activity and downstream ERK activation.\nTaken together, our results point out that myocardial competency to increase vascularization is not altered in IDCM, but dysfunctional SDF-1-mediated migration by peripheral pro-angiogenic cells through ILK and downstream ERK signaling may compromise endothelial recovery in patients.

Pathogenesis of this disease is not fully understood. Accordingly, angiogenesis represents a special field of research due to its role in atherogenesis. STEPS OF ANGIOGENESIS: Angiogenesis is a complex biological process, which requires the precise coordination of its four steps (vasodilatation and permeability, vessel destabilization and matrix degradation, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and lumen formation and vessel stabilization). MEDIATORS OF ANGIOGENIC PROCESS: The process of forming new blood vessels is regulated by a delicate balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic molecules. Numerous soluble growth factors and inhibitors, cytokines, proteases, extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules, as well as hypoxia, inflammatory process, shear stress, hypertension and interaction between cells and extracellular matrix strictly control the angiogenic process. Neovascularization is halted due to the downregulation of angiogenic factors or the increase of inhibitors of this process. TUMOR VASCULARIZATION: In the asymptomatic phase of cancerogenesis, cancer rarely exceeds the diameter of 1-2 millimeters. However, when the metabolic demand increases, it leads to tumor vascularization. In this way, tumor switches to an angiogenic phenotype. The molecular basis of angiogenic switch refers to increased production of angiogenic factors and/or loss of angiogenic inhibitors.\nThe contribution of angiogenic process has become increasingly meaningful in understanding the pathogenesis ofatherosclerosis.", "journal": "Medicinski pregled", "date": "2013-09-28", "authors": ["DanijelaVucevi\u0107", "DordeRadak", "IvanMilovanovi\u0107", "TatjanaRadosavljevi\u0107", "DusanMladenovi\u0107"], "doi": "10.2298/mpns1308297v"}

We focused on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an untreatable highly vascularized brain tumor whose progression is thought to critically depend on the oxygen and metabolites supplied by blood vessels. We optimized protocols for orthotopic GBM grafting in mice that were able to recapitulate the biophysical constraints normally governing tumor progression and were suitable for intravital multiphoton microscopy. We repeatedly imaged tumor cells and blood vessels during GBM development. We established methods for quantitative correlative analyses of dynamic imaging data over wide fields in order to cover the entire tumor. We searched whether correlations existed between blood vessel density, tumor cell density and proliferation in control tumors. Extensive vascular remodeling and the formation of new vessels accompanied U87 tumor cell growth, but no strong correlation was found between local cell density and the extent of local blood vessel density irrespective of the tumor area or time points. The technique moreover proves useful for comparative analysis of mice subjected either to Bevacizumab anti-angiogenic treatment that targets VEGF or to AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCR4 receptor. Bevacizumab treatment massively reduced tumoral vessel densities but only transiently reduced U87 tumor growth rate. Again, there was no correlation between local blood vessel density and local cell density. Moreover, Bev applied only prior to tumor implantation inhibited tumor growth to the same extent as post-grafting treatment. AMD3100 achieved a potent inhibition of tumor growth without significant reduction in blood vessel density.

{"title": "Modeling steady state SO2-dependent changes in capillary ATP concentration using novel O2 micro-delivery methods.", "abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to be released from the erythrocyte in an oxygen (O2) dependent manner. Since ATP is a potent vasodilator, it is proposed to be a key regulator in the pathway that mediates micro-vascular response to varying tissue O2 demand. We propose that ATP signaling mainly originates in the capillaries due to the relatively long erythrocyte transit times in the capillary and the short ATP diffusion distance to the electrically coupled endothelium. We have developed a computational model to investigate the effect of delivering or removing O2 to limited areas at the surface of a tissue with an idealized parallel capillary array on total ATP concentration. Simulations were conducted when exposing full surface to perturbations in tissue O2 tension (PO2) or locally using a circular micro-outlet (~100 \u03bcm in diameter), a square micro-slit (200 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm), or a rectangular micro-slit (1000 \u03bcm wide \u00d7 200 \u03bcm long). Results indicated the rectangular micro-slit has the optimal dimensions for altering hemoglobin saturations (SO2) in sufficient number capillaries to generate effective changes in total [ATP]. This suggests a threshold for the minimum number of capillaries that need to be stimulated in vivo by imposed tissue hypoxia to induce a conducted micro-vascular response. SO2 and corresponding [ATP] changes were also modeled in a terminal arteriole (9 \u03bcm in diameter) that replaces 4 surface capillaries in the idealized network geometry. Based on the results, the contribution of terminal arterioles to the net change in [ATP] in the micro-vascular network is minimal although they would participate as O2 sources thus influencing the O2 distribution.

The outcome of chemotherapy in metastatic stages, where surgery is no longer viable, shows a 5-year survival <5%. It is apparent that in-vitro experiments, no matter how well designed, may fail to adequately represent the complex in-vivo microenvironmental and phenotypic characteristics of the cancer, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. We evaluate in-vitro cytotoxic data as an indicator of in-vivo treatment success using a mathematical model of tumor growth based on a dimensionless formulation describing tumor biology. Inputs to the model are obtained under optimal drug exposure conditions in-vitro. The model incorporates heterogeneous cell proliferation and death caused by spatial diffusion gradients of oxygen/nutrients due to inefficient vascularization and abundant stroma, and thus is able to simulate the effect of the microenvironment as a barrier to effective nutrient and drug delivery. Analysis of the mathematical model indicates the pancreatic tumors to be mostly resistant to Gemcitabine treatment in-vivo. The model results are confirmed with experiments in live mice, which indicate uninhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis with Gemcitabine treatment. By extracting mathematical model parameter values for proliferation and death from monolayer in-vitro cytotoxicity experiments with pancreatic cancer cells, and simulating the effects of spatial diffusion, we use the model to predict the drug response in-vivo, beyond what would have been expected from sole consideration of the cancer intrinsic resistance. We conclude that this integrated experimental/computational approach may enhance understanding of pancreatic cancer behavior and its response to various chemotherapies, and, further, that such an approach could predict resistance based on pharmacokinetic measurements with the goal to maximize effective treatment strategies.", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "date": "2013-09-27", "authors": ["James JLee", "JustinHuang", "Christopher GEngland", "Lacey RMcNally", "Hermann BFrieboes"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003231"}

Because of this limitation, there is significant ongoing effort to develop alternative cancer screening and detection strategies for this population. This pilot study evaluates the potential of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging (DOSI) to image known tumors in dense breast tissue.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis on 24 radiographically dense breast cancer subjects measured with DOSI over a four-year period (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System - BI-RADS, category 3 and 4, average age = 39 \u00b1 7.6, average maximum size 31 \u00b1 1 7 mm). Two previously-described DOSI contrast functions, the tissue optical index (TOI) and the specific tumor component (STC), which are based upon the concentrations and spectral signatures of hemoglobin, water and lipids, respectively, were used to form 2D optical images of breast tumors.\nUsing TOI and STC, 21 out of 24 breast tumors were found to be statistically different from the surrounding highly vascularized dense tissue and to be distinguishable from the areolar region.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of radiation therapy on osseointegrated dental implant survival in oral cancer patients.\nA review of the literature published between 1990 and June 2012 was conducted. Pertinent studies evaluating the effect of radiation therapy on osseointegration of implants were identified through searches of PubMed, SCIRUS, and Google Scholar. Overall implant survival rates were compared with respect to timing of radiation (prior to or after implantation), site of implant placement (maxilla, mandible, vascularized free flaps, nonvascular bone grafts), radiation dose, time interval between radiation therapy and implant placement, and the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\nThirty-eight articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Overall implant survival rates with radiation therapy done pre- and postimplantation were 88.9% and 92.2%, respectively. In preimplantation radiation therapy, the implant survival rate was significantly higher for the mandible (93.3%) than for the maxilla (78.9%) or for grafted bone (87.5%). Similarly, the implant survival rate was higher when implants were placed in free flaps (89.3%) than in nonvascularized bone grafts (81.7%). While a radiation dose above 55 Gy significantly decreased implant survival, no significant relationship between increased implant survival and the remaining variables were found.\nThere, was no significant difference in dental implant survival rates between preimplantation and postimplantation radiation therapy. The anatomical site of implant placement in preimplantation radiation therapy was the most pertinent variable affecting implant survival, with a better survival rate in the mandible compared to the maxilla and grafted bone.", "journal": "The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["NasserNooh"], "doi": "10.11607/jomi.3045"}

The inoculation of poly(ethylene glycol) into microparticle matrices realized a gradual release for 4\u00a0weeks of CP-pDNA nanoparticles, leading to an incremental transfection efficiency and strong secretion of extracellular matrices. After subcutaneous infusion of microparticles with encapsulated both CP-pVEGF and CP-pbFGF nanoparticles, significantly higher densities of blood vessels were achieved than those containing individual nanoparticles, and induced a rapid generation of mature blood vessels with few cytotoxicity and inflammation reactions.\nElectrosprayed microparticle with CP-pDNA nanoparticles encapsulated promoted the formation of vascular networks, providing clinical relevance for therapeutic vascularization and regeneration of functional tissues after injection to ischemic sites or entrapment into tissue engineering scaffolds.", "journal": "Pharmaceutical research", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["XueqinGuo", "TianXia", "HuanWang", "FangChen", "RongCheng", "XiaomingLuo", "XiaohongLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s11095-013-1209-y"}
{"title": "Influence of gain adjustment on 3-dimensional power Doppler indices and on spatiotemporal image correlation volumetric pulsatility indices using a flow phantom.", "abstract": "Spatiotemporal image correlation can be used to acquire 3-dimensional power Doppler information across a single cardiac cycle. Assessment and comparison of the systolic and diastolic components of the data sets allow measurement of the recently introduced \"volumetric pulsatility index\" (vPI) through algorithms comparable with those used in 2-dimensional Doppler waveform analysis. The vPI could potentially overcome the dependency on certain machine settings, such as power, color gain, pulse repetition frequency, and attenuation, since these factors would affect the power Doppler signal equally throughout the cardiac cycle. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of color gain on the vascularization index (VI), vascularization-flow index (VFI), and vPI using an in vitro flow phantom model. We separated gains into 3 bands: -8 to -1 (no noise), -1 to +5 (low noise), and +5 to +8 (obvious noise). The vPI was determined from the 3-dimensional VI or VFI using the formula vPI = (maximum - minimum)/mean. Using no-noise gains, we observed that although the VI and VFI increased linearly with gain, the vPI was substantially less dependent on this adjustment. The VI and VFI continued to increase linearly with gain, whereas the vPI decreased slightly using low-noise gains. When gain was increased above the lower limit of obvious noise (+5), the VI and VFI increased noticeably, and there were marked reductions in both vPI values. We conclude that the vPI is less affected by changes in color gain than the VI and VFI at no-noise gains.", "journal": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine", "date": "2013-09-26", "authors": ["Andre HMiyague", "Nicholas JRaine-Fenning", "Theo ZPavan", "Lukasz TPolanski", "Miriam NBaumgarten", "Carolina ONastri", "Wellington PMartins"], "doi": "10.7863/ultra.32.10.1831"}

Here, we investigate a strategy to exploit endogenous cell recruitment mechanisms to regenerate injured bone by local targeting and activation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. A mandibular defect model was selected for evaluating regeneration of bone following trauma or congenital disease. The particular challenges of mandibular reconstruction are inherent in the complex anatomy and function of the bone given that the area is highly vascularized and in close proximity to muscle. Nanofibers composed of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLAGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) were used to delivery FTY720, a targeted agonist of S1P receptors 1 and 3. In vitro culture of bone progenitor cells on drug-loaded constructs significantly enhanced SDF1\u03b1 mediated chemotaxis of bone marrow mononuclear cells. In vivo results show that local delivery of FTY720 from composite nanofibers enhanced blood vessel ingrowth and increased recruitment of M2 alternatively activated macrophages, leading to significant osseous tissue ingrowth into critical sized defects after 12 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate that local activation of S1P receptors is a regenerative cue resulting in recruitment of wound healing or anti-inflammatory macrophages and bone healing.

In vitro, synthetic miR-24 overexpression had detrimental effects on SMC functional capacity inducing apoptosis, migration defects, enhanced autophagy, and loss of contractile marker genes.

Many insights have been made into key EC receptors and ligands/growth factors that govern sprouting angiogenesis, but intracellular molecular mechanisms of this process are not well understood. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor well-known for regulating the stress response in multiple pathologic settings, but its role in development is less appreciated. Here, we show that Nrf2 is increased and activated during vascular development. Global deletion of Nrf2 resulted in reduction of vascular density as well as EC sprouting. This was also observed with specific deletion of Nrf2 in ECs, but not with deletion of Nrf2 in the surrounding nonvascular tissue. Nrf2 deletion resulted in increased delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) expression and Notch activity in ECs. Blockade of Dll4 or Notch signaling restored the vascular phenotype in Nrf2 KOs. Constitutive activation of endothelial Nrf2 enhanced EC sprouting and vascularization by suppression of Dll4/Notch signaling in vivo and in vitro. Nrf2 activation in ECs suppressed Dll4 expression under normoxia and hypoxia and inhibited Dll4-induced Notch signaling. Activation of Nrf2 blocked VEGF induction of VEGFR2-PI3K/Akt and downregulated HIF-2\u03b1 in ECs, which may serve as important mechanisms for Nrf2 inhibition of Dll4 and Notch signaling.

Low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMWF) is a sulfated polysaccharide that potentiates several growth factors, including pro-angiogenic growth factors. To investigate whether hASC preconditioning with LMWF promoted bone repair, we compared the effects of LMWF and low-molecular-weight heparin on hASC phenotype and osteogenic differentiation. LMWF did not modify the stem-cell phenotype of hASCs but enhanced their osteogenic differentiation (formation of calcium deposits, increased activity and expression of alkaline phosphatase, and increased expression of osteopontin and runt-related transcription factor 2). However, when hASCs were exposed to LMWF before their adhesion to biphasic calcium phosphate particles and implantation in a bone-growth mouse model, no bone formation was apparent after 5 or 8 weeks, probably due to cell death.

The close proximity of insulin secreting beta cells and ECs also plays a critical role in modulating the proliferation and survival of both cell types with the mechanisms governing this interaction poorly understood. Isolated islets lose EC morphology and mass over a period of days in culture prohibiting study of this interaction in vitro. The loss of ECs also limits the efficacy of islet transplant revascularization in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes. We previously showed that microfluidically driven flow positively affects beta-cell function and EC survival in culture due to enhanced transport of media into the tissue. However, holding islets stationary in media flow using a dam-wall design also resulted in reduced glucose-stimulated metabolic and Ca(2+) responses at the periphery of the tissue consistent with shear-induced damage. We have now created a device that traps islets into sequential cup-shaped nozzles. This hydrodynamic trap design limits flow velocity around the perimeter of the islet while enhancing media flow through the tissue. We demonstrate the feasibility of this device to dynamically treat and collect effluent from islets.

Therefore, oxygen-sensitive signaling pathways are thought to play a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and progression. Here, the function of prolyl hydroxylase-4 (PHD4), a relative of the prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins 1-3 that promote the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), was interrogated. To test the hypothesis that PHD4 might inhibit tumor angiogenesis, it was overexpressed in osteosarcoma cells, and unexpectedly, this manipulation led to increased tumor blood vessel density. However, the newly formed blood vessels were smaller than normal and appeared to be partially nonfunctional, as indicated by poor vessel perfusion. PHD4 overexpression in tumor cells stimulated the expression of TGF-\u03b1, which was necessary and sufficient to promote angiogenic sprouting of endothelial cells. On the other hand, PHD4 overexpression reduced HIF-2\u03b1 protein levels, which in turn inhibited in vivo tumor growth. Combined, elevated PHD4 levels deregulate angiogenesis via increased TGF-\u03b1 expression in vitro and in vivo. These data support the hypothesis that tumor growth can be uncoupled from vessel density and that the individual PHD family members exert distinct functions in tumors.\nPHD4 influences tumor growth and vascularization through discrete mechanisms and molecular pathways that likely have therapeutic potential.", "journal": "Molecular cancer research : MCR", "date": "2013-09-21", "authors": ["AnneKlotzsche-von Ameln", "InaPrade", "MarianneGrosser", "AntjeKettelhake", "MaryamRezaei", "TriantafyllosChavakis", "IngoFlamme", "BenWielockx", "GeorgBreier"], "doi": "10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0201"}

We examined the role of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) in retinal vascular network formation during postnatal development using Ang1 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, and tested the effects of intraocular administration of Ang1 in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model that mimics cardinal features of ROP and PDR. We observed that Ang1 plays a substantial role in the formation of the retinal vascular network during postnatal development and that Ang1 supplementation can rescue vascular retinopathies by simultaneously promoting healthy vascular network formation and inhibiting subsequent abnormal angiogenesis, vascular leakage, and neuronal dysfunction in the retinas of the OIR model. We attribute these Ang1-induced effects to a dual signaling pathway-Tie2 signaling in the vascular region and integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 signaling in the astrocytes. The activation of integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 signaling promoted fibronectin accumulation and radial distribution along the sprouting endothelial cells, which consequently stimulated guided angiogenesis in the retina.

A tissue-specific response to Tri-mAb was confirmed by ex vivo separation of subcutaneous (SC) or orthotopic tumor cells from stromal cells, followed by reinjection of tumor cells into the opposite site. Compared with SC tumors, orthotopic tumors had a microenvironment associated with a type 2 immune response, related to immunosuppression, and an involvement of alternatively activated macrophages in the kidney model. Orthotopic kidney tumors were more highly vascularized than SC tumors.

Angiogenic factors including VEGFs and ANGPTs have documented roles in angiogenesis. However, direct studies on the production and regulation of angiogenic factors by individual, growing follicles are limited.\nOvaries (n = 9 pairs) were obtained from rhesus macaques during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (cycle days 1-4). Secondary (125-225 \u00b5m) follicles were isolated mechanically, encapsulated into alginate (0.25% w/v) and cultured for 40 days.\nIndividual follicles were cultured in a 5 or 20% O(2) environment in alpha minimum essential medium supplemented with recombinant human (h) FSH. Half of the follicles had recombinant hLH added to the media from Days 30 to 40. Follicle diameters were measured weekly. Follicles were categorized at Week 5 as no-grow (NG; <250 \u03bcm in diameter), slow-grow (SG; 251-499 \u03bcm) and fast-grow (FG; >500 \u03bcm). VEGF-A, ANGPT-1 and -2 concentrations in media were measured by ELISA.\nVEGF concentrations were low throughout the culture for NG follicles. SG and FG follicles had detectable VEGF concentrations at Week 2, which continued to rise throughout culture. VEGF concentrations were distinct (P < 0.05) among all three follicle categories during Weeks 4 and 5. VEGF concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in SG follicles in the presence of high/mid-dose FSH at 5% O(2). In contrast, there were no dose-dependent differences in VEGF production for FG follicles based on FSH concentrations or O(2) tension. At Week 5, follicles that produced metaphase II oocytes, following exposure to an ovulatory hCG dose, secreted higher concentrations of VEGF than those containing germinal vesicle-intact oocytes. Media concentrations of ANGPT-1 were low throughout culture for all three follicle categories. ANGPT-2 concentrations were low throughout culture for NG follicles. In contrast, ANGPT-2 concentrations of SG and FG follicles continued to rise from Weeks 1 to 4. During Weeks 2-4, ANGPT-2 concentrations in FG follicles were significantly higher than those of SG and NG follicles (P < 0.05).\nThis study reports VEGF-A, ANGPT-1 and -2 production by in vitro-developed individual primate (macaque) follicles, that is limited to the interval from the secondary to small antral stage. After VEGF and ANGPT-1 assays, the limited remaining samples did not allow assessment of the independent effects of gonadotrophin and O(2) on the ANGPT-2 production by cultured follicles. Findings await translation to human follicles.\nThe above findings provide novel information on the process of primate follicle maturation. We hypothesize that a symbiotic relationship between elevated concentrations of ANGPT-2 and VEGF allows FG antral follicles to excel in follicle maturation, e.g. by promoting its vascularization. Elevated ANGPT-2 may also offer possible insight into future oocyte quality as early as Week 2, compared with Week 4 for VEGF and follicle size.\nThe study was funded by the following grants: NIH U54 RR024347/HD058294/PL1-EB008542 (Oncofertility Consortium), NIH U54-HD018185 (SCCPIR), NIH ORWH/NICHD 2K12HD043488 (BIRCWH), NIH FIC TW/HD-00668, ONPRC 8P51OD011092.

Twelve months postoperatively, both patients were able to void while standing. A satisfactory aesthetic appearance of the neo-phallus could be preserved with an excellent tactile and erogenous sensitivity. Using this technique, we successfully salvaged the neo-urethra and reconstructed the outer lining of the neo-phallus", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2013-09-17", "authors": ["Laurent A HTchang", "Ren\u00e9 DLargo", "DorisBabst", "RetoWettstein", "Martin DHaug", "Daniel FKalbermatten", "Dirk JSchaefer"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22168"}

A prospective blinded comparison between magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography.", "abstract": "Introduction The aim of this study was to compare magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the preoperative assessment of crural arteries and their skin perforators prior to free fibular transfer. Patients and methods Fifteen consecutive patients, scheduled for free vascularized fibular flap transfer, were subjected to DSA as well as MRA of the crural arteries of both legs (n = 30). All DSA and MRA images were assessed randomly, blindly, and independently by two radiologists. Each of the assessors scored the degree of stenosis of various segments on a 5 point scale from 0 (occlusive) to 4 (no stenosis). The Cohen's Kappa coefficient was used to assess the agreement between DSA and MRA scores. In addition, the number of cutaneous perforators were scored and the assessors were asked if they would advise against fibula harvest and transplantation based on the images. Results A Cohen's Kappa of 0.64, indicating \"substantial agreement of stenosis severity scores\" was found between the two imaging techniques. The sensitivity of MRA to detect a stenosis compared with DSA was 79% (CI 95%:60-91), and a specificity of 98% (CI 95%: 97-99). In 53 out of 60 assessments, advice on suitability for transfer were equal between DSA and MRA. The median number of cutaneous perforators that perfuse the skin overlying the fibula per leg was one for DSA as well as MRA (P = 0.142).Conclusions A substantial agreement in the assessment of stenosis severity was found between DSA and MRA. The results suggest that MRA is a good alternative to DSA in the preoperative planning of free fibula flap transplantation.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2013-09-17", "authors": ["StevenKlein", "Krijn PVan Lienden", "MarcelVan't Veer", "Jeroen MSmit", "Paul M NWerker"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22146"}

A review of the English-language literature reveals only a few articles describing the treatment of hard and/or soft palatal perforation related to cocaine inhalation. Described here are 4 patients with a history of cocaine abuse showing palatal lesions.\nFrom 2010 to 2013, a total of 4 patients affected by cocaine-related midline destructive lesions were referred to our department. They all presented signs of a cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion. They showed wide midfacial destruction involving the nasal septum as well as the hard and soft palates causing an ample oronasal communication.\nIn 3 patients, oronasal communication has been treated successfully using a personal technique based on a partially de-epithelialized forearm free flap. The fourth patient had been treated only with local debridement because, when she came to our attention, her abusive habits were still unsolved.\nDifferent surgical options have been reported such as local, regional, and free flaps for hard and soft palate reconstruction. However, because of an unpredictable vascularization of the palatal tissues and owing to the scarceness of the local soft tissues, local flaps are at high risk for partial and complete failure. The transfer of free vascularized tissue, however, seems to be the most reliable and logical solution for medium- to large-sized fistulas.

We made the algorithm for reconstruction of composite cranial defects using the fascial component of free anterolateral thigh flaps.\nSix cases of composite cranial defects were reconstructed using free anterolateral thigh flaps with the fascial component. The type of method used was classified into 3 types. Type 1 involves separating the fascia from the flap completely and using it as a nonvascularized component. In type 2, the fascia is not separated from the flap and is instead used as a vascularized component. Type 3 involves separating the vascularized adipofascial component from the skin paddle and using it as a chimeric pattern flap. The algorithm for determining the type of fascial component is applied depending on the condition of the defect.\nAll flaps were transferred successfully in every case.

In this article, the modified multiple osteotomized perforator-based versatile free iliac osteocutaneous flap is described. Eleven cases were enrolled. Seven patients had wide anterior mandibular resections due to oral cavity and mandibular tumors; 3 patients had a defect due to explosive injury and 1 patient had complicated orbitomaxillary defect due to blast injury.

In 8 patients, the bony segment was divided into 3 segments by 2 osteotomies, whereas in 2 patients the bony segment was divided into 4 segments by 3 osteotomies. In 10 cases, the flap was used for anterior mandibular defects, whereas in 1 case the flap was customized to fit an L-shaped defect at the naso-orbito-maxillary region. The overall flap success rate was 100%. No resorption or morbidity related to the osteotomy of the bony segments was observed. The size of perforator skin paddle was 6 to 8 \u00d7 15 to 18 cm.

{"title": "Assessing gene network stability and individual variability in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) transcriptome.", "abstract": "Transcriptomics is increasingly used to assess biological responses to environmental stimuli and stressors such as aquatic pollutants. However, fundamental studies characterizing individual variability in mRNA levels are lacking, which currently limits the use of transcriptomics in environmental monitoring assessments. To address individual variability in transcript abundance, we performed a meta-analysis on 231 microarrays that were conducted in the fathead minnow (FHM), a widely used toxicological model. The mean variability for gene probes was ranked from most to least variable based upon the coefficient of variation. Transcripts that were the most variable in individual tissues included NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 1, GTPase IMAP family member 7-like and v-set domain-containing T-cell activation inhibitor 1-like while genes encoding ribosomal proteins (rpl24 and rpl36), basic transcription factor 3, and nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha subunit were the least variable in individuals across a range of microarray experiments. Gene networks that showed high variability (based upon the variation in expression of individual members within the network) included cell proliferation, metabolism (steroid, lipids, and glucose), cell adhesion, vascularization, and regeneration while those that showed low variability (more stability) included mRNA and rRNA processing, regulation of translational fidelity, RNA splicing, and ribosome biogenesis. Real-time PCR was conducted on a subset of genes for comparison of variability collected from the microarrays. There was a significant positive relationship between the two methods when measuring individual variability, suggesting that variability detected in microarray data can be used to guide decisions on sample sizes for measuring transcripts in real-time PCR experiments. A power analysis revealed that measuring estrogen receptor ba (esrba) requires fewer biological replicates than that of estrogen receptor bb (esrbb) in the gonad and samples sizes required to detect a 50% change for reproductive-related transcripts is between 12 and 20.

However, current microbubble imaging strategies require either a clot sufficiently large to produce a circulation filling defect or a clot with sufficient vascularization to allow for targeted accumulation of contrast agents. Previously, we reported the design of a microbubble formulation that modulated its ability to generate ultrasound contrast from interaction with thrombin through incorporation of aptamer-containing DNA crosslinks in the encapsulating shell, enabling the measurement of a local chemical environment by changes in acoustic activity. However, this contrast agent lacked sufficient stability and lifetime in blood to be used as a diagnostic tool. Here we describe a PEG-stabilized, thrombin-activated microbubble (PSTA-MB) with sufficient stability to be used in vivo in circulation with no change in biomarker sensitivity. In the presence of actively clotting blood, PSTA-MBs showed a 5-fold increase in acoustic activity. Specificity for the presence of thrombin and stability under constant shear flow were demonstrated in a home-built in vitro model. Finally, PSTA-MBs were able to detect the presence of an active clot within the vena cava of a rabbit sufficiently small as to not be visible by current non-specific contrast agents.

Herein, we demonstrate that miR-130b up-regulation exhibits clinical relevance as it is linked to advanced colorectal cancers (CRCs), poor patients' prognosis, and molecular features of enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. miR-130b high-expressing cells develop large, dedifferentiated, and vascularized tumors in mouse xenografts, features that are reverted by intratumor injection of a specific antisense RNA. In contrast, injection of the corresponding mimic in mouse xenografts from miR-130b low-expressing cells increases tumor growth and angiogenic potential while reduces the epithelial hallmarks. These biologic effects are reproduced in human CRC cell lines. We identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) as an miR-130b direct target in CRC in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the effects of PPAR\u03b3 gain- and loss-of-function phenocopy those due to miR-130b down-regulation or up-regulation, respectively, underscoring their biologic relevance. Furthermore, we provide mechanistic evidences that most of the miR-130b-dependent effects are due to PPAR\u03b3 suppression that in turn deregulates PTEN, E-cadherin, Snail, and vascular endothelial growth factor, key mediators of cell proliferation, EMT, and angiogenesis. Since higher levels of miR-130b are found in advanced tumor stages (III-IV), we propose a novel role of the miR-130b-PPAR\u03b3 axis in fostering the progression toward more invasive CRCs.

The proliferation rate of Med1-MBs in culture was dependent upon Nrp2, while reducing Nrp1 function had little effect. Knockdown of Nrp2 prior to cell implantation significantly increased mouse survival, compared to transfection with a non-targeting siRNA.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate our institutional experience in managing ORN through a retrospective review of case series from a large urban academic cancer centre.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted to include all ORN cases from 2003 to 2009 diagnosed at the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and the Department of Dentistry. The staging of ORN was assessed as affected by tumor site, tumor stage, radiotherapy modality and dose, chemotherapy, dental work, and time to diagnosis. The effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) and surgery in the management of ORN was evaluated.\nFourteen cases of ORN were documented (incidence 0.84%). Primary subsites included tonsils, tongue, retromolar trigone, parotid gland, soft palate and buccal mucosa. There were 5 (35.7%) stage 1, 3 (21.4%) stage 2, and 6 (42.9%) stage 3 cases. ORN severity was not significantly associated with gender, smoking, alcohol use, tumor site, T stage, N stage, AJCC stage, or treatment modality (radiation alone, surgery with adjuvant radiation or adjuvant chemoradiation). Patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy developed less severe ORN compared to those treated with conventional radiotherapy (p < 0.015). ORN stage did not correlate with radiation dose. In one patient only dental procedures were performed following radiation and could be implicated as the cause of ORN. HBO therapy failed to prevent ORN progression.

{"title": "Synaptojanin-2 binding protein stabilizes the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4 and inhibits sprouting angiogenesis.", "abstract": "The formation of novel blood vessels is initiated by vascular endothelial growth factor. Subsequently, DLL4-Notch signaling controls the selection of tip cells, which guide new sprouts, and trailing stalk cells. Notch signaling in stalk cells is induced by DLL4 on the tip cells. Moreover, DLL4 and DLL1 are expressed in the stalk cell plexus to maintain Notch signaling. Notch loss-of-function causes formation of a hyperdense vascular network with disturbed blood flow.\nThis study was aimed at identifying novel modifiers of Notch signaling that interact with the intracellular domains of DLL1 and DLL4.\nSynaptojanin-2 binding protein (SYNJ2BP, also known as ARIP2) interacted with the PDZ binding motif of DLL1 and DLL4, but not with the Notch ligand Jagged-1. SYNJ2BP was preferentially expressed in stalk cells, enhanced DLL1 and DLL4 protein stability, and promoted Notch signaling in endothelial cells. SYNJ2BP induced expression of the Notch target genes HEY1, lunatic fringe (LFNG), and ephrin-B2, reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and decreased expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C. It inhibited the expression of genes enriched in tip cells, such as angiopoietin-2, ESM1, and Apelin, and impaired tip cell formation. SYNJ2BP inhibited endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and VEGF-induced angiogenesis. This could be rescued by blockade of Notch signaling or application of angiopoietin-2. SYNJ2BP-silenced human endothelial cells formed a functional vascular network in immunocompromised mice with significantly increased vascular density.\nThese data identify SYNJ2BP as a novel inhibitor of tip cell formation, executing its functions predominately by promoting Delta-Notch signaling.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2013-09-13", "authors": ["M GordianAdam", "CarolineBerger", "AnjaFeldner", "Wan-JenYang", "JoycelynW\u00fcstehube-Lausch", "Stefanie EHerberich", "MarcelPinder", "SabineGesierich", "Hans-PeterHammes", "Hellmut GAugustin", "AndreasFischer"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.301686"}

In vivo overexpression of S100A4 led to a significant increase in tumor growth and vascularization in a human melanoma xenograft M21 model. Conversely, when silencing S100A4 by shRNA technology, a dramatic decrease in tumor development of the pancreatic MiaPACA-2 cell line was observed.

{"title": "A surgical model for isolating the pig liver in vivo for gene therapy.", "abstract": "Several studies report results that suggest the need of vascularization blocking for efficient gene transfer to the liver, especially in nonviral gene therapy. In this study, we describe a surgical strategy for in vivo isolation of the pig liver, resulting in a vascular watertight organ that allows the evaluation of several gene injection conditions. The hepatic artery and portal, suprahepatic and infrahepatic cava veins were dissected. Then, liver vascularization was excluded for 5-7 min. In that time, we first injected 200 ml saline solution containing the p3c-eGFP plasmid (20 \u00b5g/ml) simultaneously through two different catheters placed in the portal and cava veins, respectively. Vital constants were monitored during the surgery to assess the safety of the procedure. Basal systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 92.8/63.2 mm Hg and dropped to 40.7/31.3 mm Hg at the end of vascular exclusion; the mean basal heart rate was 58 bpm, reaching 95 bpm when the blood pressure was low. Oxygen saturation was maintained above 98% during the intervention, and no relevant changes were observed in the ECG tracing. Peak plasma AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels were observed after 24 h (151 and 57 IU, respectively). These values were higher, but not relevant, in 60 ml/s injection than in 20 ml/s injection. Efficiency of gene transfer was studied with simultaneous (cava and portal veins) injection of eGFP gene at flow rates of 20 and 60 ml/s. Liver tissue samples were collected 24 h after injection and qPCR was carried out on each lobe sample. The results confirmed the efficiency of the procedure. Gene delivery differed between 20 ml/s (9.9-31.0 eGFP DNA copies/100 pg of total DNA) and 60 ml/s injections (0.6-1.1 eGFP DNA copies/100 pg of total DNA). Gene transcription showed no significant differences between 20 ml/s (15,701.8-21,475.8 eGFP RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA) and 60 ml/s (12,014-36,371 eGFP RNA copies/100 ng of total RNA). The procedure is not harmful for animals and it offers a wide range of gene delivery options because it allows different perfusion ways (anterograde and retrograde) and different flow rates to determine the optimal conditions of gene transfer. This strategy permits the use of cell therapy and viral or non-viral liver gene therapy, especially appropriated to a wide variety of inherited or acquired diseases because of the liver's ability to produce and deliver proteins to the bloodstream.", "journal": "European surgical research.

Hydrogels formed from natural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins readily support the formation of vasculature in vitro, but only a handful of hydrogels composed of synthetic materials have shown anything comparable. This relative lack of synthetic material options has hindered efforts to better understand how ECM cues direct vascularization. We developed a biosynthetic hydrogel consisting of polyethylene glycol diacrylamide conjugated to macromolecular type-I collagen. Through their acrylamide-based crosslinks, these materials allow for independent control of physical properties and bulk ligand concentration. These hydrogels exhibited hydrolytic stability, but the collagen component retained its susceptibility to enzymatic remodeling. Photoencapsulation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts within this hydrogel material and their subsequent co-culture led to the formation of capillary vessel-like networks with well-defined hollow lumens. Capillary formation was prevented by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, recapitulating the MMP-dependence of vascularization observed in natural hydrogels.

Disruption of HEXIM1 activity in a knock-in mouse model expressing a mutant HEXIM1 protein resulted in increased susceptibility to the development of mammary tumours, partly by up-regulation of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) expression, HIF-1\u03b1 expression and aberrant vascularization. We now report on the mechanistic basis for HEXIM1 regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. We observed direct interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and HEXIM1, and HEXIM1 up-regulated hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1, resulting in the induction of the interaction of HIF-1\u03b1 with pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein) and ubiquitination of HIF-1\u03b1. The up-regulation of hydroxylation involves HEXIM1-mediated induction of PHD3 (prolyl hydroxylase 3) expression and interaction of PHD3 with HIF-1\u03b1. Acetylation of HIF-1\u03b1 has been proposed to result in increased interaction of HIF-1\u03b1 with pVHL and induced pVHL-mediated ubiquitination, which leads to the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1\u03b1. HEXIM1 also attenuated the interaction of HIF-1\u03b1 with HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), resulting in acetylation of HIF-1\u03b1.

The challenge now is to determine how the SHF and cardiac NCC interact, the complex reciprocal signaling that appears to be occurring at various stages of OFT morphogenesis, and finally how endocardial progenitors and primary heart field (PHF) communicate with both these colonizing extra-cardiac lineages. Although we are beginning to understand that this dance of progenitor populations is wonderfully intricate, the underlying pathogenesis and the spatiotemporal cell lineage interactions remain to be fully elucidated.

{"title": "Spinal reconstruction for osteomyelitis with free vascularized fibular grafts using intra-abdominal recipient vessels: A series of three cases.", "abstract": "Reconstruction of bony defects in the surgical management of vertebral osteomyelitis is a challenging endeavor. Our objective is to report the use of intra-abdominal vessels as the recipient vessels for microanastomosis of vascularized bone graft and the use of a spinal cage for fixation. Three patients failed conservative treatment for vertebral osteomyelitis and suffered pathologic fracture. Their treatment consisted of staged posterior irrigation and debridement with segmental fixation, followed by a thoracoabdominal approach multiple-level corpectomy. Reconstruction was performed with a free vascularized fibular graft placed within a custom, expandable cage. The vascularized fibular graft was anastomosed to an intra-abdominal recipient vessel. All patients improved clinically with no neurologic deficits noted. All showed evidence of successful fusion. Free vascularized bone grafts continue to be an excellent option for multi-level spinal defects related to osteomyelitis. Intra-abdominal recipient vessels are appropriate recipient vessels, as their diameter, length, and accessibility allow vascularized bone graft reconstruction of vertebral column defects of the thoracolumbar region. These vessels are also easily accessible and the anastomoses can be performed in the superficial operating incision.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2013-09-10", "authors": ["Kristen AAliano", "MarcAgulnick", "BenjaminCohen", "GaryGonya", "ChristopherLow", "SteveStavrides", "TommasoAddona", "JohnGoncalves", "DavidShin", "Matthew SKilgo", "Thomas ADavenport"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22150"}
{"title": "QHREDGS enhances tube formation, metabolism and survival of endothelial cells in collagen-chitosan hydrogels.", "abstract": "Cell survival in complex, vascularized tissues, has been implicated as a major bottleneck in advancement of therapies based on cardiac tissue engineering. This limitation motivates the search for small, inexpensive molecules that would simultaneously be cardio-protective and vasculogenic. Here, we present peptide sequence QHREDGS, based upon the fibrinogen-like domain of angiopoietin-1, as a prime candidate molecule. We demonstrated previously that QHREDGS improved cardiomyocyte metabolism and mitigated serum starved apoptosis. In this paper we further demonstrate the potency of QHREDGS in its ability to enhance endothelial cell survival, metabolism and tube formation. When endothelial cells were exposed to the soluble form of QHREDGS, improvements in endothelial cell barrier functionality, nitric oxide production and cell metabolism (ATP levels) in serum starved conditions were found. The functionality of the peptide was then examined when conjugated to collagen-chitosan hydrogel, a potential carrier for in vivo application. The presence of the peptide in the hydrogel mitigated paclitaxel induced apoptosis of endothelial cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the peptide modified hydrogels stimulated tube-like structure formation of encapsulated endothelial cells. When integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b15\u03b21 were antibody blocked during cell encapsulation in peptide modified hydrogels, tube formation was abolished. Therefore, the dual protective nature of the novel peptide QHREDGS may position this peptide as an appealing augmentation for collagen-chitosan hydrogels that could be used for biomaterial delivered cell therapies in the settings of myocardial infarction.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-09-10", "authors": ["Jason WMiklas", "Susan MDallabrida", "Lewis AReis", "NesreenIsmail", "MariaRupnick", "MilicaRadisic"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0072956"}

Turning this switch toward a proangiogenic state involves an altered interplay between tumor cells and multiple components of the surrounding stroma.

We develop a model of leaf hydration that considers the average conductance of the vascular network to a representative areole (region bounded by the vascular network), and represent the volume of tissue within the areole as a poroelastic composite of cells and air spaces. Solutions to the 3D flow problem are found by numerical simulation, and these results are then compared to 1D models with exact solutions for a range of leaf geometries, based on a survey of temperate woody plants. We then show that the hydration times given by these solutions are well approximated by a sum of the ideal capacitor and plane sheet times, representing the time for transport through the vasculature and tissue respectively. We then develop scaling factors relating this approximate solution to the 3D model, and examine the dependence of these scaling factors on leaf geometry. Finally, we apply a similar strategy to reduce the dimensions of the steady state problem, in the context of peristomatal transpiration, and consider the relation of transpirational gradients to equilibrium leaf water potential measurements.", "journal": "Journal of theoretical biology", "date": "2013-09-10", "authors": ["Fulton ERockwell", "N MicheleHolbrook", "Abraham DStroock"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.08.027"}

We analyzed the mechanisms by which islets engrafted, vascularized and functioned over the long term in the small intestinal submucosa. To determine engraftment, survival and function, 350 syngenic islets were transplanted into either intestinal segments or portal vein of diabetic rats. Islet reorganization, vascularization and function were analyzed by histological analysis, RT-PCR analysis as well as glycemic control over up to 1 year. Transplantation of syngeneic islets in marginal numbers successfully restored normoglycemia in diabetic rats. Transplantation of semi-pure islet preparation did not impair their engraftment, vascularization and function. Islets were morphologically intact and expressed insulin as well as glucagon over the year. Expression of angiogenic genes permitted revascularization of transplanted islets. We identified the expression of transcription factors required for maintenance of beta cells. These studies demonstrated that marginal mass of transplanted islets was sufficient to restore euglycemia in streptozotocin-treated rats. These superior results were obtained despite use of an impure preparation of islets in animals with small intestinal segment.

{"title": "Cooperation by fibroblasts and bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells to improve pancreatic rat-to-mouse islet xenotransplantation.", "abstract": "Experimental and clinical experiences highlight the need to review some aspects of islet transplantation, especially with regard to site of grafting and control of the immune response. The subcutaneous space could be a good alternative to liver but its sparse vasculature is its main limitation. Induction of graft tolerance by using cells with immunoregulatory properties is a promising approach to avoid graft rejection. Both Fibroblasts and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have shown pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties. Transplantation of islets into the subcutaneous space using plasma as scaffold and supplemented with fibroblasts and/or Bone Marrow-MSCs could be a promising strategy to achieve a functional extra-hepatic islet graft, without using immunosuppressive drugs. Xenogenic rat islets, autologous fibroblasts and/or allogenic BM-MSCs, were mixed with plasma, and coagulation was induced to constitute a Plasma-based Scaffold containing Islets (PSI), which was transplanted subcutaneously both in immunodeficient and immunocompetent diabetic mice. In immunodeficient diabetic mice, PSI itself allowed hyperglycemia reversion temporarily, but the presence of pro-angiogenic cells (fibroblasts or BM-MSCs) within PSI was necessary to improve graft re-vascularization and, thus, consistently maintain normoglycemia. In immunocompetent diabetic mice, only PSI containing BM-MSCs, but not those containing fibroblasts, normalized glycemia lasting up to one week after transplantation. Interestingly, when PSI contained both fibroblasts and BM-MSCs, the normoglycemia period showed an increase of 4-times with a physiological-like response in functional tests. Histology of immunocompetent mice showed an attenuation of the immune response in those grafts with BM-MSCs, which was improved by co-transplantation with fibroblasts, since they increased BM-MSC survival. In summary, fibroblasts and BM-MSCs showed similar pro-angiogenic properties in this model of islet xenotransplantation, whereas only BM-MSCs exerted an immunomodulatory effect, which was improved by the presence of fibroblasts. These results suggest that cooperation of different cell types with islets will be required to achieve a long-term functional graft.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-09-07", "authors": ["MarcosPerez-Basterrechea", "Alvaro JObaya", "AlvaroMeana", "JesusOtero", "Manuel MEsteban"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0073526\n10.1007/s11892-011-0217-8\n10.2337/db09-1846\n10.2337/diabetes.54.1.100\n10.2337/db09-0490\n10.3727/096368909X471198\n10.1007/s11892-011-0216-9\n10.3727/000000006783981954\n10.3727/096368910X536527\n10.1097/MOT.0b013e32833239ff\n10.1016/S0039-6060(99)70183-2\n10.1677/joe.0.1630181\n10.1097/01.TP.0000159145.86990.44\n10.1089/ten.2005.11.1323\n10.1097/00007890-200201150-00023\n10.3727/000000005783982792\n10.2337/db08-0180\n10.1038/cr.2010.44\n10.1101/cshperspect.a015560\n10.1517/14712598.2011.574119\n10.1097/00007890-201007272-00241\n10.1016/j.humimm.2010.08.003\n10.1007/s10875-010-9415-4\n10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0088\n10.1097/01.tp.0000250659.24286.43\n10.1097/00007890-198802000-00051\n10.1038/nprot.2008.221\n10.1007/BF01062525\n10.1172/JCI42304\n10.1089/scd.2010.0246\n10.3727/096368910X508762\n10.1074/jbc.275.3.1521\n10.2337/diabetes.51.12.3435\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.10.019\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.057\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3181db09c4\n10.1007/s00125-011-2053-4\n10.1634/stemcells.2005-0121\n10.1091/mbc.E11-05-0393\n10.1378/chest.122.6_suppl.326S\n10.2217/rme.12.55\n10.1089/scd.2007.0230\n10.1074/jbc.M212158200\n10.1007/s13238-011-1097-z\n10.3324/haematol.13699\n10.1007/978-1-61779-108-6_18\n10.1007/s00125-002-0827-4\n10.2337/db10-0136\n10.2337/db09-0317\n10.1196/annals.1447.042\n10.1097/TP.0b013e3182384ab0\n10.2337/db10-1068\n10.2337/db11-0654"}

Little is known about cellular responses to this nanomaterial, though it was used in human.

POSS-PCU supported ADSC survival and proliferation and their migration and differentiation into cartilage within the nanoscaffold.

{"title": "Calcium Orthophosphate-Based Bioceramics.", "abstract": "Various types of grafts have been traditionally used to restore damaged bones. In the late 1960s, a strong interest was raised in studying ceramics as potential bone grafts due to their biomechanical properties. A bit later, such synthetic biomaterials were called bioceramics. In principle, bioceramics can be prepared from diverse materials but this review is limited to calcium orthophosphate-based formulations only, which possess the specific advantages due to the chemical similarity to mammalian bones and teeth. During the past 40 years, there have been a number of important achievements in this field. Namely, after the initial development of bioceramics that was just tolerated in the physiological environment, an emphasis was shifted towards the formulations able to form direct chemical bonds with the adjacent bones. Afterwards, by the structural and compositional controls, it became possible to choose whether the calcium orthophosphate-based implants remain biologically stable once incorporated into the skeletal structure or whether they were resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of regenerative bioceramics was developed and such formulations became an integrated part of the tissue engineering approach. Now calcium orthophosphate scaffolds are designed to induce bone formation and vascularization. These scaffolds are often porous and harbor different biomolecules and/or cells. Therefore, current biomedical applications of calcium orthophosphate bioceramics include bone augmentations, artificial bone grafts, maxillofacial reconstruction, spinal fusion, periodontal disease repairs and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Perspective future applications comprise drug delivery and tissue engineering purposes because calcium orthophosphates appear to be promising carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and various

Histologic examination revealed that 11 cases were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), eight were conjunctival or corneal intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) with dysplastic cells in the epithelium, eight simple hyperplasia, and three inflammatory lesions. The majority of SCC (9/11 eyes, 81.8%) involved the nasal conjunctiva and cornea, while one of eight eyes (12.5%) with CIN was located at the nasal side. Vascularization was combined in all eyes with SCC, in two of eight (25%) with CIN, in two of three with inflammation, and in none with hyperplasia. Both cornea and conjunctiva were involved in ten of 11 eyes (90.9%) with SCC, in six of eight (75%) with CIN, in two of eight (25%) with hyperplasia, and in two of three (66.7%) with inflammation. When classified based on clinical appearance, seven of 11 eyes (63.6%) with SCC were papilliform sessile masses, and four of eight (50 %) with CIN showed gelatinous growth onto the surface. All lesions were treated with en-bloc excision and cryotherapy. Recurrence occurred in seven out of 19 patients (36.8%) with SCC or CIN during the mean follow-up of 30.0 months-four patients with SCC and three with CIN. Hyperplasia or lesions with inflammation did not recur. The recurrence rate was not associated with histological diagnosis of a lesion. However, the use of the postoperative chemotherapy including topical mitomycin C or interferon \u03b1 2b had a significant negative correlation with the recurrence.\nIn total, 36.7% of tumors in the corneal and conjunctival epithelium were SCC, and 26.7% were CIN.

The primary stromal cell type found in prostate tumors is the carcinoma-associated fibroblast, which produces placental growth factor (PlGF). PlGF is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of angiogenic molecules and PlGF mRNA levels increase after androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer. In this study, we show that PlGF has a direct dose-dependent proliferative effect on human PC-3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and fibroblast-derived PlGF increases PC-3 proliferation in co-culture. In xenograft tumor models, intratumoral administration of murine PlGF siRNA reduced stromal-derived PlGF expression, reduced tumor burden and decreased the number of Ki-67 positive proliferating cells associated with reduced vascular density. These data show that targeting stromal PlGF expression may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2013-09-06", "authors": ["KarinZins", "AnitaThomas", "TrevorLucas", "MouldySioud", "SeyedhosseinAharinejad", "DietmarAbraham"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms140917958\n10.1101/cshperspect.a011056"}

However, the biology of COX-2 in the multicellular tumor microenvironment is poorly defined.\nMammary tumor onset and multiplicity were examined in ErbB2 transgenic mice that were deficient in mammary epithelial cell COX-2 (COX-2(MEC)KO) compared to wild type (WT) mice. Tumors were analyzed, by real time PCR, immune-staining and flow cytometry, for proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and immune microenvironment. Lentiviral shRNA delivery was used to knock down (KD) COX-2 in ErbB2-transformed mouse breast cancer cells (COX-2KD), and growth as orthotopic tumors was examined in syngenic recipient mice, with or without depletion of CD8+ immune cells.\nMammary tumor onset was delayed, and multiplicity halved, in COX-2(MEC)KO mice compared to WT. COX-2(MEC)KO tumors showed decreased expression of Ki67, a proliferation marker, as well as reduced VEGFA, its receptor VEGFR2, endothelial NOS and the vascular endothelial marker CD31, indicating reduced tumor vascularization. COX-2(MEC)KO tumors contained more CD4+ T helper (Th) cells and CD8+ cytotoxic immune cells (CTL) consistent with increased immune surveillance. The ratio of Th markers Tbet (Th1) to GATA3 (Th2) was higher, and levels of Retnla, a M2 macrophage marker, lower, in COX-2(MEC)KO tumor infiltrating leukocytes compared to WT, suggesting a prevalence of pro-immune Th1 over immune suppressive Th2 lymphocytes, and reduced macrophage polarization to the immune suppressive M2 phenotype. Enhanced immune surveillance in COX-2(MEC)KO tumors was coincident with increased intratumoral CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, and decreased expression of T lymphocyte co-inhibitory receptors CTLA4 and PD-1, as well as PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1. PD-L1 was also decreased in IFN\u03b3-treated COX-2KD mouse mammary cancer cells in vitro and, compared to control cells, growth of COX-2KD cells as orthotopic tumors in immune competent mice was markedly suppressed. However, robust growth of COX-2KD tumor cells was evident when recipients were depleted of CD8+ cells.\nThe data strongly support that, in addition to its angiogenic function, tumor cell COX-2 suppresses intratumoral cytotoxic CD8+ immune cell function, possibly through upregulation of immune checkpoints, thereby contributing to tumor immune escape.

We demonstrated in vivo that local presence of low concentrations of SDF-1\u03b1 resulted in a significant increase in recruited endogenous cells, which remained present for several weeks. SDF-1\u03b1 stimulated vascularization in these hybrid constructs, as shown by the enhanced formation of erythrocyte-filled vessels. The presence of CD31-positive capillaries/small vessels after 6 weeks in vivo substantiated this finding. The SDF-1\u03b1 treatment showed increased number of cells that could differentiate to the osteogenic lineage after 6 weeks of implantation, demonstrated by expression of collagen I and osteocalcin.

Therefore, transplantation of Dll\u20114\u2011overexpressing endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) was hypothesized to be superior to transplantation of EPCs in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. In the current study, EPCs harvested from C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow were infected in vitro with Dll\u20114 (EPCDll\u20114+) or Dll\u20114 knockdown (EPCDll\u20114\u2011) with recombinant lentiviral vectors and the control cells were non\u2011transfected or transduced with mock vectors (EPCnull). Eight\u2011week\u2011old C57BL/6 mice underwent ligation of the left anterior descending artery to establish a myocardial infarction (MI) model. The ligated animals were randomly divided into 5 groups, which, following one week, were intravenously injected with EPCs, EPCnull, EPCDll\u20114+, EPCDll\u20114\u2011 or medium. Two weeks later, echocardiographic assessment, western blotting, fluorescent microsphere and histological studies were performed. The results demonstrated that the number of mature vessels and blood flow in ischemic myocardium were increased in the EPCDll\u20114+ group, but were markedly decreased in the EPCDll\u20114\u2011 group compared with the control groups. The expression levels of Dll\u20114, hairy/enhancer of split (Hes)\u2011related protein 1 (Hey\u20111), phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) were significantly increased in the EPCDll\u20114+ group, while they were markedly decreased in the EPCDll\u20114\u2011 group. Furthermore, for EPCDll\u20114+\u2011treated animals, an enhanced cardiac function was observed as assessed by echocardiography. Thus, the transplantation of Dll\u20114\u2011overexpressing EPCs stimulates neovascularization effectively, increases the blood flow to the ischemic zone and improves cardiac function. These effects may be due to the activation of Notch/Hey\u20111/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways, which are initiated by Dll\u20114.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2013-09-05", "authors": ["HongHuang", "FengHuang", "Jian-PingHuang"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2013.1657"}

A total of ten deer constituted the material of the study. Vascularization of organs was investigated by using latex injection technique. Left adrenal glands were basically supplied by coeliac, cranial mesenteric, renal and lumbal arteries. The arterial vascularization of the left adrenal glands was very complex in comparison with right adrenal glands. In two examples, branch of the lumbal artery was divided into phrenic caudal artery and cranial adrenal artery. In six examples, it was observed that the caudomedial and ventral regions of the left adrenal glands were also supplied by thinner branches that stemmed from second left lumbal artery. Besides, coeliac and cranial mesenteric arteries also gave off shorter branches supplying the cranial region of the left adrenal glands in five examples. It was determined that two branches originated from abdominal aorta directly for supplying left adrenal glands in only two examples. In four examples, two caudal adrenal arteries stemmed separately from left renal artery in a short distance. Arterial vascularization of right adrenal glands was more constant and supplied by lumbal and renal arteries. The adrenal glands were generally oval or round shaped. In only two examples, left adrenal glands were 'V-' or heart-shaped.

{"title": "Cell-based approaches to the engineering of vascularized bone tissue.", "abstract": "This review summarizes recent efforts to create vascularized bone tissue in vitro and in vivo through the use of cell-based therapy approaches. The treatment of large and recalcitrant bone wounds is a serious clinical problem, and in the United States approximately 10% of all fractures are complicated by delayed union or non-union. Treatment approaches with the use of growth factor and gene delivery have shown some promise, but results are variable and clinical complications have arisen. Cell-based therapies offer the potential to recapitulate key components of the bone-healing cascade, which involves concomitant regeneration of vasculature and new bone tissue. For this reason, osteogenic and vasculogenic cell types have been combined in co-cultures to capitalize on the function of each cell type and to promote heterotypic interactions. Experiments in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems have provided insight into the mechanisms by which osteogenic and vasculogenic cells interact to form vascularized bone, and these approaches have been translated to ectopic and orthotopic models in small-animal studies. The knowledge generated by these studies will inform and facilitate the next\u00a0generation of pre-clinical studies, which are needed to move cell-based orthopaedic repair strategies into the clinic.

{"title": "Mild heat stress enhances angiogenesis in a co-culture system consisting of primary human osteoblasts and outgrowth endothelial cells.", "abstract": "The repair and regeneration of large bone defects, including the formation of functional vasculature, represents a highly challenging task for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Recent studies have shown that vascularization and ossification can be stimulated by mild heat stress (MHS), which would offer the option to enhance the bone regeneration process by relatively simple means. However, the mechanisms of MHS-enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis, as well as potential risks for the treated cells are unclear. We have investigated the direct effect of MHS on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in a co-culture system of human outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) and primary osteoblasts (pOBs), and assessed cytotoxic effects, as well as the levels of various heat shock proteins (HSPs) synthesized under these conditions. Enhanced formation of microvessel-like structures was observed in co-cultures exposed to MHS (41\u00b0C, 1 h), twice per week, over a time period of 7-14 days. As shown by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was up-regulated in MHS-treated co-cultures 24 h post-treatment. At the protein level, significantly elevated VEGF and Ang-1 concentrations were observed in MHS-treated co-cultures and pOB mono-cultures compared with controls, indicating paracrine effects associated with MHS-induced angiogenesis. MHS-stimulated co-cultures and OEC mono-cultures released higher levels of Ang-2 than untreated cultures. On the other hand MHS treatment of co-cultures did not result in a clear effect regarding osteogenesis. Nevertheless, real-time PCR demonstrated that MHS increased the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase, interleukin-6, and bone morphogenetic protein 2, known as HSP-related molecules in angiogenic and osteogenic regulation pathways. In agreement with these observations, the expression of some selected HSPs also increased at both the mRNA and protein levels in MHS-treated co-cultures.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

They may also be active as unprocessed B-C-A pro-forms. Relaxin has been shown to pay a key role within the ovary, being involved in follicle growth, and ovulation. Relaxin is produced in large amounts also by the corpus luteum where it acts as an endocrine hormone positively affecting implantation, placentation and vascularization during the all-important first trimester phase of pregnancy establishment. Relaxin exerts its functions via the receptor RXFP1. Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) in contrast acts through the related receptor RXFP2, and plays an essential role in the production of androgens within growing antral follicles. INSL3 is also produced in large amounts by the male fetus shortly after sex determination, where it controls the first transabdominal phase of testicular descent. However, this fetal INSL3 is also able to influence placental and maternal physiology, indicating associations with later preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction.

Augmenting BAT mass or increasing BAT activation could potentially be used to decrease obesity. Noninvasive methods to detect and monitor BAT mass are needed. Contrast ultrasound can estimate BAT blood flow and is able to measure the perfused volume of an organ and thus its mass. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether contrast ultrasound could characterize BAT mass in two mouse models of obesity: wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet and mutant db/db mice.\nContrast ultrasound of BAT (Definity 2 \u03bcL/min; 14-MHz linear probe) was performed before and after stimulation of BAT with norepinephrine (NE). BAT replenishment curves were obtained, and blood flow was estimated by the product of the curve's plateau and slope. Additionally, consecutive two-dimensional images of perfused BAT were acquired at 1-mm intervals after stimulation with NE and used to assess BAT volume and mass.\nBAT blood flow increased after NE infusion in all mice studied. Blood flow response to NE was similar in wild-type mice fed either a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet. BAT blood flow was lower in db/db mice than in wild-type mice (P\u00a0= .02). Contrast ultrasound-derived BAT mass was correlated with BAT mass obtained at necropsy (R(2)\u00a0= 0.83, P < .001). BAT mass was higher in mice fed a high-fat diet than in those fed a low-fat diet.\nContrast ultrasound can be used to estimate BAT mass in mice when BAT vascularization is not significantly impaired.

Vascularization of adipose tissue was examined by confocal microscopy and perfusion was determined by recovery of injected microspheres. Adipose tissue inflammation and systemic metabolic function were also assessed.\nModest over-expression of adiponectin led to a marked increase in adipose tissue vascularity and perfusion, and this was associated with diminished hypoxia and an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in the obese mice. Adiponectin over-expression in diet-induced obese mice also led to the virtual absence of macrophage infiltration and the elimination of crown-like structures. Adiponectin transgenic mice also displayed a remarkable sensitivity to insulin and diminished hepatic steatosis. Under the conditions of these experiments, adiponectin deficiency did not diminish adipose tissue perfusion or worsen metabolic function compared to wild type mice fed the high fat/high sucrose diet.\nThese data demonstrate that increased circulating adiponectin levels, and the obese environment, are associated with increased adipose tissue vascularization and perfusion, and improved metabolic function under conditions of long term diet-induced obesity.", "journal": "Metabolism: clinical and experimental", "date": "2013-09-03", "authors": ["Tamar RAprahamian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.metabol.2013.07.010"}

{"title": "Usefulness of sonography in the diagnosis of rheumatoid hand.", "abstract": "Ultrasound examination is becoming more and more common in patients with rheumatoid diseases. Above all, it enables the assessment of articular soft tissues and constitutes a non-invasive examination. In a rheumatologist's everyday practice, it is conducted at the stage of initial diagnosis as well as to monitor the treatment and to confirm the remission if the clinical picture is ambiguous. The first sign of arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis) that is visible on ultrasound examination is the thickening of the synovial membrane of the joint cavities, tendon sheaths or bursae. It is frequently accompanied by the exudate in the joint, sheath or bursa. In a subsequent stage, in Doppler examination, enhanced vascularization of the synovial membrane is observed. Sometimes, the inflammatory process of the tendon sheaths also affects the tendons, which might lead to their damage. Moreover, ultrasound examination also reveals erosions and inflammatory cysts (geodes) which attest to the advancement of the disease. A dynamic ultrasound examination enables to diagnose the capsule-ligamentous contracture of the interphalangeal joints, which occurs due to the lack of rehabilitation that should begin at the moment of the commencement of the inflammation. The ultrasound image does not allow for the differentiation between various rheumatoid entities, including those encompassing the joints in the hand, wrist. The observed changes, i.e. thickening of the synovial membrane, hyperemia, effusions, erosions or tendon damage, may accompany various rheumatoid entities. The purpose of the ultrasound examination is to recognize these irregularities, determine their localization and advancement and, finally, to monitor the course of treatment. Furthermore, ultrasound scan enables to assess the joints and tendons in a dynamic examination in relation to local ailments of the patient as well as to monitor the biopsy, aspiration and medicine administration. Sonography is used for a US-guided administration of radioisotope substances for synoviorthesis.\nBadanie ultrasonograficzne jest coraz powszechniej wykonywane u pacjent\u00f3w z chorobami reumatycznymi.

{"title": "Oxygen generating biomaterials preserve skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic and ischemic conditions.", "abstract": "Provision of supplemental oxygen to maintain soft tissue viability acutely following trauma in which vascularization has been compromised would be beneficial for limb and tissue salvage. For this application, an oxygen generating biomaterial that may be injected directly into the soft tissue could provide an unprecedented treatment in the acute trauma setting. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine if sodium percarbonate (SPO), an oxygen generating biomaterial, is capable of maintaining resting skeletal muscle homeostasis under otherwise hypoxic conditions. In the current studies, a biologically and physiologically compatible range of SPO (1-2 mg/mL) was shown to: 1) improve the maintenance of contractility and attenuate the accumulation of HIF1\u03b1, depletion of intramuscular glycogen, and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) that occurred following \u223c30 minutes of hypoxia in primarily resting (duty cycle\u200a=\u200a0.2 s train/120 s contraction interval <0.002) rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles in vitro (95% N2-5% CO2, 37\u00b0C); 2) attenuate elevations of rat EDL muscle resting tension that occurred during contractile fatigue testing (3 bouts of 25 100 Hz tetanic contractions; duty cycle\u200a=\u200a0.2 s/2 s\u200a=\u200a0.1) under oxygenated conditions in vitro (95% O2-5% CO2, 37\u00b0C); and 3) improve the maintenance of contractility (in vivo) and prevent glycogen depletion in rat tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in a hindlimb ischemia model (i.e., ligation of the iliac artery). Additionally, injection of a commercially available lipid oxygen-carrying compound or the components (sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide) of 1 mg/mL SPO did not improve EDL muscle contractility under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a biological and physiological concentration of SPO (1-2 mg/mL) injected directly into rat skeletal muscle (EDL or TA muscles) can partially preserve resting skeletal muscle homeostasis under hypoxic conditions.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-08-31", "authors": ["Catherine LWard", "Benjamin TCorona", "James JYoo", "Benjamin SHarrison", "George JChrist"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0072485"}

With viewing pterygium as a tumorigenic mimicry, we investigated ANG profiles within pterygia.\nExpression levels of ANG were assessed using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blotting through examination of excised specimens and cultured fibroblasts from pterygium and conjunctiva tissues. The phenotypes of pterygia were classified by four grading indices, including recurrence, growth activity, pterygium body translucency (T), and vascularity (V). Then, ANG levels in pterygia were differentiated according to phenotypes of pterygia, and were compared to levels in normal conjunctiva. Furthermore, to investigate ANG-related acquisition of proliferative potency in fibroblasts, the correlation between ANG and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels was evaluated.\nIn immunohistochemistry, ANG was expressed strongly in pterygium stroma with all four severe phenotypes (with recurrence, active growth, thick body [T3], and marked vascularization [V3]), especially at the perivascular areas. There was a trend toward higher ANG expression in cultured fibroblasts of pterygia with severe phenotype, compared to those without and with normal conjunctiva. However, pterygium body V had a weak association with ANG expression. Additionally, Western blotting revealed a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and ANG.\nOverexpression of ANG in pterygium body fibroblasts might be involved in active pterygium growth with thick pterygium body formation and increased risk of recurrence. A possible mechanism for this finding includes ANG-related transition of pterygium fibroblasts to the proliferative state.", "journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "date": "2013-08-31", "authors": ["Kyoung WooKim", "Soo HyunPark", "Sung WookWee", "Jae ChanKim"], "doi": "10.1167/iovs.13-12141"}

Drug causes many adverse effects including thyroid disorders in 14-18% of patients: amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis type I and type II (AIT I, AIT II) and amiodarone induced hypothyroidism (AIH). AIT occurs more frequently in geographical areas with low iodine intake, whereas AIH is more frequent in iodine-sufficient areas. AIH may appear both in normal thyroid gland and Hashimoto's disease. AIT I occurs most often on the basis of Greave's disease or goiter. In contrast to AIT, AIH does not cause difficulties with diagnosis and treatment. In order to differentiate between AIT I and AIT II such methods as USG, CFDS, RAIU, MIBI and IL-6 are used. Increased vascularization showed in CFDS, increased MIBI uptake in scintigraphy, increased 131I uptake in RAIU in some cases are typical for AIT I. In opposition to AIT I, all this parameters are decreased in AIT II and it is possible that the level of serum IL-6 is increased. However, the usefulness of IL-6 is controversial. After diagnosis discontinuation of amiodarone should be taken into consideration. In addition, AIT I is preferably treated with methimazole and potassium perchlorate. AIT II is treated with glucocorticoids. In the case of unclear diagnosis and mixed types of AIT the combination of all foregoing drugs should be instituted.

Four patients who had been diagnosed with moyamoya disease before pregnancy did not show neurological events in pregnancy and puerperium, but two patients who were newly diagnosed or progressed during the perinatal period suffered neurological deterioration due to ischemic stroke. Surgical revascularization at the subacute stage relieved their symptoms and they did not suffer permanent neurological deficit.

It is almost exclusively arterially vascularized, unlike the vascularization of the liver, which has a dual supply with a portal component of 75 to 80% and an arterial component of 20 to 25%. The reference treatment for intermediary stages of the Barcelona (B) classification is hepatic artery chemoembolization. The aim of chemoembolization is to inject the tumor chemotherapy into the artery and then to embolize the artery (or arteries), which supply the tumor. For this, knowledge of the anatomy of the hepatic artery is essential. Approximately 55% of the patients belong to the modal distribution, although numerous anatomical variants exist and must be recognized. In addition, primarily non-hepatic arteries may contribute to the vascularization of some hepatocellular carcinomas. Furthermore, new arterial supplies can be recruited by tumors after surgical or chemoembolization treatments. The aim of this article is to describe the different arteries, which may vascularize hepatocellular carcinomas.

The repairs entailed replacing a catheter through the fistula, separating the trachea and esophagus completely using sharp dissection and placing vascularized tissue, either pleura or pericardium between the suture lines. Postoperative complications included seven anastomotic leaks, four strictures and three recurrent fistulas. Long-term follow-up (median of 84\u00a0months) showed that 21 took all of their nutrition by mouth, three were tube fed and two required a combination of both.

A novel mouse model was designed to allow conditional production of human sFlt1 by \u03b2-cells in order to trap VEGF and study the effect of time-dependent inhibition of VEGF signaling on adult \u03b2-cell fate and metabolism. Secretion of sFlt1 by adult \u03b2-cells resulted in a rapid regression of blood vessels and hypoxia within the islets. Besides blunted insulin release, \u03b2-cells displayed a remarkable capacity for coping with these presumed unfavorable conditions: even after prolonged periods of blood vessel ablation, basal and stimulated blood glucose levels were only slightly increased, while \u03b2-cell proliferation and mass remained unaffected. Moreover, ablation of blood vessels did not prevent \u03b2-cell generation after severe pancreas injury by partial pancreatic duct ligation or partial pancreatectomy. Our data thus argue against a major role of blood vessels to preserve adult \u03b2-cell generation and function, restricting their importance to facilitating rapid and adequate insulin delivery.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2013-08-27", "authors": ["JokeD'Hoker", "NicoDe Leu", "YvesHeremans", "LucBaeyens", "KohtaroMinami", "CaiYing", "AstridLavens", "MarieChintinne", "GeertStang\u00e9", "JudithMagenheim", "AvitalSwisa", "GeertMartens", "DanielPipeleers", "Markvan de Casteele", "SusumoSeino", "EliKeshet", "YuvalDor", "HarryHeimberg"], "doi": "10.2337/db12-1827"}

Hepatocytes isolated from luciferase-transgenic Lewis rats were transplanted into jejunal segments of wild-type Lewis rats with mucosa removal without PCS application. Luciferase-derived luminescence from transplanted hepatocytes was stably detected for 30 days.

To create an intestinal PCS system in pigs, an auto-graft of the segmental ileum and interposing vessel graft were anastomosed to the portal vein trunk and inferior vena cava. However, thrombi were observed in vessels of the intestinal PCSs. We measured the correlation between infusion pressure and flow volume in whole intestines ex vivo in both species and found that the high pressure corresponding to portal hypertension was still insufficient to maintain the patency of the intestinal grafts.

Therefore, the identification of molecules involved in CSC self-renewal is a necessary step toward more effective therapies. To this aim, through the transcription profiling of the murine ErbB2(+) tumor cell line TUBO vs. derived CSC-enriched mammospheres, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was identified as 2-fold overexpressed in CSCs, as confirmed by qPCR and cytofluorimetric analysis. TLR2 signaling inhibition impaired in vitro mammosphere generation in murine TUBO (60%) and 4T1 (30%) and human MDA-MB-231 (50%), HCC1806 (60%), and MCF7 (50%) cells.

In vivo TLR2 inhibition blocked TUBO tumor takes in 9/14 mice and induced a 2-fold reduction in lung metastases development by decreasing cell proliferation and vascularization and increasing apoptosis.

HIF-1\u03b1 knockdown (KD) cells were established in the scirrhous gastric cancer cell line 58As9. Using KD and control (SC) cells, the presence of peritoneal dissemination was assessed in orthotopic implantation (o.i.) and intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) models. A series of in vitro analyses were also conducted. Finally, tumor angiogenesis was immunohistochemically analyzed. In the o.i. model, peritoneal dissemination was more frequently observed in the SC mice (93%) compared to the KD mice (13%) (P<0.001). In the i.p. model, peritoneal dissemination occurred at a high rate in both types of mice; however, a greater number of nodules was observed in the KD mice (P=0.017). The in vitro assays showed that HIF-1\u03b1 exerts unfavorable effects on anoikis resistance and adhesion to extracellular matrix.

Vascular invasion was present in the intratumoral regions of the disseminated nodules in the SC o.i., but not the i.p., mice.

In contrast, HIF-1\u03b1 played an inhibitory role in suppressing peritoneal dissemination in the i.p. model.

Then, the examiner subjectively selected the two volumes with the highest and lowest color signals, respectively. We averaged these two values. Agreement between VI measurements was estimated by calculating intra-class correlation coefficients. The intra-class correlation coefficient for the VI was 0.999 (95% confidence interval: 0.999-1.000). The mean time needed to calculate the mean VI using the entire 4-D STIC sequence was significantly longer than the mean time needed to calculate the average value from the volumes with the highest and lowest color signals determined by the operator (p < 0001). We conclude that there is significant agreement between the two methods. Calculating the average VI from the highest and lowest values is less time consuming than calculating the mean VI from the complete STIC sequence.", "journal": "Ultrasound in medicine & biology", "date": "2013-08-24", "authors": ["Marek JKudla", "TomaszKandzia", "Juan LuisAlc\u00e1zar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2013.05.010"}

It produces neurons and glial cells, and is present in the foetal brain between 8 and 36 weeks of gestation. At 25 weeks, it reaches its maximum volume and subsequently withers. The GM is vulnerable to haemorrhage in preterm infants. This selective vulnerability is explained by limited astrocyte end-feet coverage of microvessels, reduced expression of fibronectin and immature tight junctions.

{"title": "Histological and micro-CT evidence of stigmatic rostellum receptivity promoting auto-pollination in the madagascan orchid Bulbophyllum bicoloratum.", "abstract": "The rostellum, a projecting part of the gynostemium in orchid flowers, separates the anther(s) from the stigma and thus commonly prevents auto-pollination. Nonetheless, as a modified (usually distal) portion of the median stigma lobe, the rostellum has been frequently invoked of having re-gained a stigmatic function in rare cases of orchid auto-pollination. Here it is shown that a newly discovered selfing variant of Madagascan Bulbophyllumbicoloratum has evolved a modified rostellum allowing the penetration of pollen tubes from in situ pollinia.\nGynostemium micro-morphology and anatomy of selfing and outcrossing variants of B. bicoloratum was studied by using light and scanning electron microscopy and histological sections. Pollen tube growth in the selfing variant was further observed via X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT), providing 3D reconstructions of floral tissues at a micron scale.\nSelfing variants possess a suberect ('displaced') rostellum rather than the conventional, erect type. Very early in anthesis, the pollinia of selfers are released from the anther and slide down onto the suberect rostellum, where pollen tube growth preferentially occurs through the non-vascularized, i.e. rear (adaxial) and (semi-) lateral parts. This penetrated tissue is comprised of a thin layer of elongate and loosely arranged cells, embedded in stigmatic exudates, as also observed in the stigmatic cavity of both selfing and outcrossing variants.\nOur results provide the first solid evidence of a stigmatic function for the rostellum in orchid flowers, thereby demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of the micro-CT technique for accurately visualizing pollen tube growth in flowering plants. Rostellum receptivity in B. bicoloratum probably uniquely evolved as an adaptation for reproductive assurance from an outcrossing ancestor possessing an erect (non-receptive) rostellum.

Biological 3D matrices provide cells an environment in which cells can self-organize, allowing the study of tissue organization and cell differentiation. Such scaffolds can be seeded with a mixture of different cell types to study direct 3D cell-cell-interactions. To mimic the 3D complexity of cancer tumors, our group has developed a 3D in vitro tumor test system. Our 3D tissue test system models the in vivo situation of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which we established with our decellularized porcine jejunal segment derived biological vascularized scaffold (BioVaSc). In our model, we reseeded a modified BioVaSc matrix with primary fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs) and the S462 tumor cell line. For static culture, the vascular structure of the BioVaSc is removed and the remaining scaffold is cut open on one side (Small Intestinal Submucosa SIS-Muc). The resulting matrix is then fixed between two metal rings (cell crowns). Another option is to culture the cell-seeded SIS-Muc in a flow bioreactor system that exposes the cells to shear stress. Here, the bioreactor is connected to a peristaltic pump in a self-constructed incubator. A computer regulates the arterial oxygen and nutrient supply via parameters such as blood pressure, temperature, and flow rate. This setup allows for a dynamic culture with either pressure-regulated pulsatile or constant flow. In this study, we could successfully establish both a static and dynamic 3D culture system for MPNSTs.

{"title": "Role of glycosylation in the anticancer activity of antibacterial peptides against breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Antibacterial peptides (ABPs) with cancer-selective toxicity have received much more attention as alternative chemotherapeutic agents in recent years. However, the basis of their anticancer activity remains unclear. The modification of cell surface glycosylation is a characteristic of cancer cells. The present study investigated the effect of glycosylation, in particular sialic acid, on the anticancer activity of ABPs. We showed that aurein 1.2, buforin IIb and BMAP-28m exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward MX-1 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The binding activity, cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity of ABPs were enhanced by the presence of O-, N-glycoproteins, gangliosides and sialic acid on the surface of breast cancer cells. Among N-, O-glycoproteins and ganglioside, O-glycoproteins almost had the strongest effect on the binding and cytotoxicity of the three peptides. Further, up-regulation of hST6Gal1 in CHO-K1 cells enhanced the susceptibility of cells to these peptides. Finally, the growth of MX-1 xenograft tumors in mice was significantly suppressed by buforin IIb treatment, which was associated with induction of apoptosis and inhibition of vascularization. These data demonstrate that the three peptides bind to breast cancer cells via an interaction with surface O-, N-glycoproteins and gangliosides. Sialic acids act as key glycan binding sites for cationic ABP binding to glycoproteins and gangliosides. Therefore, glycosylation in breast cancer cells plays an important role in the anticancer activity of ABPs, which may partly explain their cancer-selective toxicity.

Four different HPMA based copolymer structures (random as well as block copolymers with lauryl methacrylate as hydrophobic block) varying in molecular weight, size and resulting architecture were analyzed in two different tumor models (AT1 prostate carcinoma and Walker-256 mammary carcinoma) in vivo. Polymers were labeled with (18)F and organ/tumor uptake was followed by \u03bcPET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution. Vascular permeability was measured by dextran extravasation and vascular density by immunohistochemistry. Cellular polymer uptake was determined in vitro using fluorescence-labeled polymers. Most strikingly, the high molecular weight HPMA-LMA random copolymer demonstrated highest tumor uptake and blood pool concentration. The molecular structure (e.g., amphiphilicity) is holding a higher impact on desired in vivo properties than polymer size. The results also revealed pronounced differences between the tumor models although vascular permeability was almost comparable. Accumulation in Walker-256 carcinomas was much higher, presumably due to a better cellular uptake in this cell line and a denser vascular network in the tumors.

Compared with lean women, obese women are more likely to be diagnosed with a larger, higher grade tumor, an increased incidence of lymph node metastases, and elevated risk of distant recurrence. However, the mechanisms connecting obesity to the pathogenesis of breast cancer are poorly defined. Here, we show that during obesity, adipocytes within human and mouse breast tissues recruit and activate macrophages through a previously uncharacterized CCL2/IL-1\u03b2/CXCL12 signaling pathway. Activated macrophages in turn promote stromal vascularization and angiogenesis even before the formation of cancer. Recapitulating these changes using a novel humanized breast cancer model was sufficient to promote angiogenesis and prime the microenvironment prior to neoplastic transformation for accelerated breast oncogenesis.

This study tests the hypothesis that the mechanically-induced hyperaemia undergoes some attenuation upon repetitive stimulation. Muscle blood flow was recorded from 9 masseteric arteries (5 right, 4 left) in 6 anesthetized rabbits. Two mechanical stimuli, masseter muscle compression (MC) and occlusion of the masseteric artery (AO), were provided in different combinations: A) repeated stimulation (0.5 Hz, for 40 s); B) single stimuli delivered at decreasing inter-stimulus interval (ISI) from 4 min to 2 s, C) single AO delivered before and immediately after a series of 20 MCs at 0.5 Hz, and vice-versa. Repetitive AO stimulation at 0.5 Hz produced a transient hyperaemia (378 \u00b1189%) peaking at 4.5 \u00b11.4 s and then decaying before the end of stimulation. The hyperaemic response to individual AOs progressively decreased by 74 \u00b139% with decreasing ISI from 4 min to 2 s (p<0.01). Non significant differences were observed between AO and MC stimulation. Decreased response to AO was also provoked by previous repetitive MC stimulation, and vice-versa.

Only one transplanted biopsy and one injected cell line has engrafted successfully leading to conventional central high-grade chondrosarcoma similar to the original biopsies. In culture, two new stable cell lines were obtained, one from a dedifferentiated and one from a grade III conventional central chondrosarcoma biopsy. Their genetic characterization revealed triploid karyotypes, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53, deletion in CDKN2A and/or MDM2 amplification. These cell lines expressed mesenchymal membrane markers (CD44, 73, 90, 105) and were able to produce a hyaline cartilaginous matrix when cultured in chondrogenic three-dimensional (3D) pellets. Using a high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR approach, we observed that cell lines cultured in monolayer had lost expression of several genes implicated in cartilage development (COL2A1, COMP, ACAN) but restored their expression in 3D cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells in monolayer were sensitive to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents but became resistant to low doses of mafosfamide or doxorubicin when cultured in 3D pellets, in parallel with an altered nucleic accumulation of the drug. Our results indicate that the cartilaginous matrix produced by chondrosarcoma cells may impair diffusion of several drugs and thus contribute to chemoresistance. Therefore, 3D chondrogenic cell pellets constitute a more relevant model to study chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and may be a valuable alternative to animal experimentations.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["DavidMonderer", "AlexandrineLuseau", "Am\u00e9lieBellec", "EmmanuelleDavid", "St\u00e9phaniePonsolle", "SorayaSaiagh", "SylvainBercegeay", "PhilippePiloquet", "Marc GDenis", "LaurenceLod\u00e9", "Fran\u00e7oiseR\u00e9dini", "MarineBiger", "DominiqueHeymann", "Marie-Fran\u00e7oiseHeymann", "RonanLe Bot", "Fran\u00e7oisGouin", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricBlanchard"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2013.101"}

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured alone and in various co-culture combinations with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to determine their vasculogenic abilities in vitro. Results demonstrated that the delayed addition of MSCs to pre-formed EC networks, whereby MSCs act as pericytes to the nascent vessels, resulted in the best developed vasculature. The results also demonstrate that the crosstalk between ECs and MSCs during microvessel formation occurs in a highly regulated, spatio-temporal fashion, whereby the initial seeding of ECs results in platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) release; the subsequent addition of MSCs 3 days later leads to a cessation in PDGF production, coinciding with increased vascular endothelial cell growth factor expression and enhanced vessel formation. Functional assessment of these pre-engineered constructs in a subcutaneous rat implant model demonstrated anastomosis between the in vitro engineered vessels and the host vasculature, with significantly increased vascularization occurring in the co-culture group. This study has thus provided new information on the process of in vitro vasculogenesis within a three-dimensional porous scaffold for tissue engineering and demonstrates the potential for using these vascularized scaffolds in the repair of critical sized bone defects.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["T MMcFadden", "G PDuffy", "A BAllen", "H YStevens", "S MSchwarzmaier", "NPlesnila", "J MMurphy", "F PBarry", "R EGuldberg", "F JO'Brien"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.08.014"}

The margin of the branching vascular network and the late geographic hyperfluorescence on ICGA was colocalized on OCT, in a point-to-point manner, using innate software. The large vessels within the branching vascular network were also colocalized on OCT.\nLate geographic hyperfluorescence on ICGA was noted in 30 eyes. The extent of late geographic hyperfluorescence was larger than that of branching vascular network in 12 eyes. In the remaining eyes, the extent was the same. A double-layer sign on OCT, which consisted of two hyper-reflective lines, representing the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch membrane, was noted in 29 eyes. In all 28 eyes exhibiting both late geographic hyperfluorescence and the double-layer sign, the extent of late geographic hyperfluorescence matched exactly the extent of double-layer sign on OCT. In 7 of 34 eyes, the thickness of the subretinal pigment epithelial space over the Bruch membrane was too thin to accommodate the large vessels of the branching vascular network. Although the double-layer sign showed mild reduction in area after photodynamic therapy, its general configuration was maintained.\nLate geographic hyperfluorescence on ICGA corresponds with the double-layer sign on OCT in eyes with PCV.

We tested the validity of this hypothesis by exploring the feasibility of generating different in vitro engineered bone-like structures originating from porous silk fibroin scaffolds decorated with RGD sequences (SF-RGD), seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Scaffolds with small (106-212 \u03bcm), medium (212-300 \u03bcm), and large pore diameter ranges (300-425 \u03bcm) were seeded with hMSC and subsequently differentiated in vitro into bone-like tissue resembling initial scaffold geometries and featuring bone-like structures. Eight weeks after implantation into calvarial defects in mice, the in vitro engineered bone-like tissues had remodeled into bone featuring different proportions of woven/lamellar bone bridging the defects. Regardless of pore diameter, all implants integrated well, vascularization was advanced, and bone marrow ingrowth had started. Ultimately, in this defect model, the geometry of the in vitro generated tissue-engineered bone structure, trabecular- or plate-like, had no significant impact on the healing of the defect, owing to an efficient remodeling of its structure after implantation.", "journal": "European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["SandraHofmann", "MonikaHilbe", "Robert JFajardo", "HenriHagenm\u00fcller", "KatjaNuss", "MargareteArras", "RalphM\u00fcller", "Brigittevon Rechenberg", "David LKaplan", "Hans PMerkle", "LorenzMeinel"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejpb.2013.02.011"}

For that reason, four different SF scaffolds were implanted (n=6) into drill hole defects in the cancellous bone of the sheep tibia and humerus. The scaffolds were evaluated histologically for biocompatibility, cell-material interaction, and cellular ingrowth. New bone formation was observed macroscopically and histologically at 8 weeks after implantation. For semiquantitative evaluation, the investigated parameters were scored and statistically analyzed (factorial ANOVA). All implants showed good biocompatibility as evident by low infiltration of inflammatory cells and the absent encapsulation of the scaffolds in connective tissue. Multinuclear foreign body giant cells (MFGCs) and macrophages were present in all parts of the scaffold at the material surface and actively degrading the SF material. Cell ingrowth and vascularization were uniform across the scaffold. However, in HFIP scaffolds, local regions of void pores were present throughout the scaffold, probably due to the low pore interconnectivity in this scaffold type in contrast to UPW scaffolds.

Herein we utilized hydrolytically degradable hydrogels to transplant and localize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to allograft surfaces, creating a periosteum mimetic, termed a 'tissue engineered periosteum'. Our results demonstrated that this tissue engineering approach resulted in increased graft vascularization (\u223c2.4-fold), endochondral bone formation (\u223c2.8-fold), and biomechanical strength (1.8-fold), as compared to untreated allografts, over 16 weeks of healing. Despite this enhancement in healing, the process of endochondral ossification was delayed compared to autografts, requiring further modifications for this approach to be clinically acceptable.

{"title": "Treatment with anticancer agents induces dysregulation of specific Wnt signaling pathways in human ovarian luteinized granulosa cells in vitro.", "abstract": "Chemotherapy has been associated with premature ovarian failure and infertility in women with cancer. It is well known that anticancer drugs reduce the primordial follicle pool and harm the ovarian blood vascularization leading to ovarian atrophy. However, their mechanism of injury still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the cellular mechanisms involved in the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs belonging to different classes on human ovarian luteinized granulosa cells (LGCs). Treatment with doxorubicin (DXR), paclitaxel (PC), and cisplatin (CP) affected LGCs viability by inducing apoptosis and downregulating both estrogen receptor \u03b2 and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in a dose-dependent manner. Several members of the WNT signaling pathway are expressed in granulosa cells where they regulate follicle development, ovulation, and luteinization. Here we show that treatment with DXR, PC, and CP induced upregulation of WNT4 expression, whereas WNT3 expression was downregulated by DXR and PC and upregulated by CP. Analysis of the WNT3 downstream signaling pathway showed that total \u03b2-catenin protein levels were reduced upon treatment with DXR and PC. Additionally, restoration of \u03b2-catenin signaling by lithium chloride protected LGCs from the injury induced by chemotherapy. The in vitro LGC toxicity model described might represent a tool to identify components of specific signaling pathways, such as the Wnt pathway, that can be targeted in order to limit the follicular damage caused by chemotherapy.", "journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["Ana MariaSanchez", "VeronicaGiorgione", "PaolaVigan\u00f2", "EnricoPapaleo", "MassimoCandiani", "GiorgiaMangili", "PaolaPanina-Bordignon"], "doi": "10.1093/toxsci/kft175"}

We used three approaches to determine the onset of functional vascularization when ECFC\u2009+\u2009MPC suspended in these matrices were implanted in vivo. The first was immunohistochemistry to detect vessels lined by human endothelial cells and filled with red blood cells. The second was in vivo vascular staining by tail vein injection of a mixture of Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-I), a lectin specific for human endothelium, and Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (GS-IB4 ), a lectin specific for rodent endothelium. The third approach employed contrast-enhanced ultrasound to measure the perfusion volumes of implants in individual animals over time. Human endothelial-lined tubular structures were detected in vivo on days 1 and 2 after implantation, with perfused human vessels detected on days 3 and 4. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound revealed significant perfusion of ECFC\u2009+\u2009MPC/collagen implants on days 1-4, at up to 14% perfused vascular volume. ECFC\u2009+\u2009MPC implanted in fibrin and PuraMatrix matrices also supported perfusion at day 1, as assessed by ultrasound (at 12% and 23% perfused vascular volume, respectively).

Two bi-layer matrix configurations were fabricated by solvent-casting/salt leaching either alone (Group 1) or in combination with silk film casting (Group 2) to yield porous foams buttressed by heterogeneous surface pore occlusions or homogenous silk films, respectively. Bladder augmentation was performed with each scaffold group (6 \u00d7 6 cm(2)) in juvenile Yorkshire swine for 3 m of implantation. Augmented animals exhibited high rates of survival (Group 1: 5/6, 83%; Group 2: 4/4, 100%) and voluntary voiding over the course of the study period. Urodynamic evaluations demonstrated mean increases in bladder capacity over pre-operative levels (Group 1: 277%; Group 2: 153%) which exceeded nonsurgical control gains (144%) encountered due to animal growth.In addition, animals augmented with both matrix configurations displayed increases in bladder compliance over pre-operative levels(Group 1: 357%; Group 2: 338%) similar to growth-related elevations observed in non-surgical controls (354%) [corrected]. Gross tissue evaluations revealed that both matrix configurations supported extensive de novo tissue formation throughout the entire original implantation site which exhibited ultimate tensile strength similar to nonsurgical counterparts. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that both implant groups promoted comparable extents of smooth muscle regeneration and contractile protein (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin and SM22\u03b1) expression within defect sites similar to controls. Parallel evaluations demonstrated the formation of a transitional, multi-layered urothelium with prominent cytokeratin, uroplakin, and p63 protein expression in both matrix groups.

This study is novel because no osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation protocols were applied to the cells prior to implantation. After 6 weeks, X-ray, microCT, and histological analysis showed that the hESC-MCs had consistently formed a highly vascularized new bone that bridged the bone defect and seamlessly integrated with host bone. The implanted hESC-MCs differentiated in situ to functional hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes forming new bone tissue via an endochondral ossification pathway. Evidence for the direct participation of the human cells in bone morphogenesis was verified by two separate assays: with Alu and by human mitochondrial antigen positive staining in conjunction with co-localized expression of human bone sialoprotein in histologically verified regions of new bone. The large volume of new bone in a calvarial defect and the direct participation of the hESC-MCs far exceeds that of previous studies and that of the control adult hMSCs. This study represents a key step forward for bone tissue engineering because of the large volume, vascularity, and reproducibility of new bone formation and the discovery that it is advantageous to not over-commit these progenitor cells to a particular lineage prior to implantation.

{"title": "Basement membrane-rich organoids with functional human blood vessels are permissive niches for human breast cancer metastasis.", "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer is the leading cause of death by malignancy in women worldwide. Tumor metastasis is a multistep process encompassing local invasion of cancer cells at primary tumor site, intravasation into the blood vessel, survival in systemic circulation, and extravasation across the endothelium to metastasize at a secondary site. However, only a small percentage of circulating cancer cells initiate metastatic colonies. This fact, together with the inaccessibility and structural complexity of target tissues has hampered the study of the later steps in cancer metastasis. In addition, most data are derived from in vivo models where critical steps such as intravasation/extravasation of human cancer cells are mediated by murine endothelial cells. Here, we developed a new mouse model to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying late steps of the metastatic cascade. We have shown that a network of functional human blood vessels can be formed by co-implantation of human endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells, embedded within a reconstituted basement membrane-like matrix and inoculated subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. The ability of circulating cancer cells to colonize these human vascularized organoids was next assessed in an orthotopic model of human breast cancer by bioluminescent imaging, molecular techniques and immunohistological analysis. We demonstrate that disseminated human breast cancer cells efficiently colonize organoids containing a functional microvessel network composed of human endothelial cells, connected to the mouse circulatory system. Human breast cancer cells could be clearly detected at different stages of the metastatic process: initial arrest in the human microvasculature, extravasation, and growth into avascular micrometastases.

{"title": "Monitoring monoclonal antibody delivery in oncology: the example of bevacizumab.", "abstract": "Developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies paves the way for new strategies in oncology using targeted therapy which should improve specificity. However, due to a lack of biomarkers, a personalized therapy scheme cannot always be applied with monoclonal antibodies. As a consequence, the efficacy or side effects associated with this type of treatment often appear to be sporadic. Bevacizumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). It is used to limit tumor vascularization. No prognosis or response biomarker is associated with this antibody, we therefore assessed whether the administration protocol could be a possible cause of heterogeneous responses (or variable efficacy). To do this, we developed a bevacizumab assay with a broad sensitivity range to measure blood bevacizumab concentrations. We then analyzed bevacizumab concentrations in 17 patients throughout the first quarter of treatment. In line with previously published data, average blood concentrations were 88+/-27 mg/L following the first dose administered, and 213+/-105 mg/L after the last (6(th)) dose administered. However, the individual values were scattered, with a mean 4-fold difference between the lowest and the highest concentration for each dose administered. We demonstrated that the bevacizumab administration schedule results in a high inter-individual variability in terms of blood concentrations. Comparison of assay data with clinical data indicates that blood concentrations above the median are associated with side effects, whereas values below the median favor inefficacy. In conclusion, bevacizumab-based therapy could benefit from a personalized administration schedule including follow-up and adjustment of circulating bevacizumab concentrations.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["GuillaumeNugue", "MarieBidart", "MarieArlotto", "MireilleMousseau", "Fran\u00e7oisBerger", "LaurentPelletier"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0072021\n10.1056/NEJM197111182852108\n10.1038/nrd1381\n10.1056/NEJMoa032691\n10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0121\n10.1007/s00280-007-0664-8\n10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181ef582a\n10.1001/jama.2011.51\n10.1200/JCO.2008.21.6457\n10.1007/s11060-011-0722-2\n10.1038/clpt.2011.328\n10.2165/11530560-000000000-00000\n10.3109/13813455.2012.705301\n10.1152/ajpgi.00286.2005\n10.1056/NEJMra032424"}
{"title": "EphA2-induced angiogenesis in ewing sarcoma cells works through bFGF production and is dependent on caveolin-1.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the result of the combined activity of the tumor microenvironment and signaling molecules. The angiogenic switch is represented as an imbalance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and is a rate-limiting step in the development of tumors. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-anchored ligands, known as ephrins, constitute the largest receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) subfamily and are considered a major family of pro-angiogenic RTKs. Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a highly aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor affecting children and young adults. As other solid tumors, EWS are reliant on a functional vascular network for the delivery of nutrients and oxygen and for the removal of waste. Based on the biological roles of EphA2 in promoting angiogenesis, we explored the functional role of this receptor and its relationship with caveolin-1 (CAV1) in EWS angiogenesis. We demonstrated that lack of CAV1 results in a significant reduction in micro vascular density (MVD) on 3 different in vivo models. In vitro, this phenomenon correlated with inactivation of EphA2 receptor, lack of AKT response and downregulation of bFGF. We also demonstrated that secreted bFGF from EWS cells acted as chemoattractant for endothelial cells. Furthermore, interaction between EphA2 and CAV1 was necessary for the right localization and signaling of the receptor to produce bFGF through AKT and promote migration of endothelial cells. Finally, introduction of a dominant-negative form of EphA2 into EWS cells mostly reproduced the effects occurred by CAV1 silencing, strongly suggesting that the axis EphA2-CAV1 participates in the promotion of endothelial cell migration toward the tumors favoring EWS angiogenesis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-08-21", "authors": ["MiguelS\u00e1inz-Jaspeado", "JuanHuertas-Martinez", "LauraLagares-Tena", "JuanMartin Liberal", "SilviaMateo-Lozano", "Enriquede Alava", "Carmende Torres", "JaumeMora", "Xavier GarciaDel Muro", "Oscar MTirado"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0071449"}
{"title": "The incorporation of growth factor and chondroitinase ABC into an electrospun scaffold to promote axon regrowth following spinal cord injury.", "abstract": "Spinal cord injury results in tissue necrosis in and around the lesion site, commonly leading to the formation of a fluid-filled cyst. This pathological end point represents a physical gap that impedes axonal regeneration. To overcome the obstacle of the cavity, we have explored the extent to which axonal substrates can be bioengineered through electrospinning, a process that uses an electrical field to produce fine fibres of synthetic or biological molecules. Recently, we demonstrated the potential of electrospinning to generate an aligned matrix that can influence the directionality and growth of axons. Here, we show that this matrix can be supplemented with nerve growth factor and chondroitinase ABC to provide trophic support and neutralize glial-derived inhibitory proteins. Moreover, we show how air-gap electrospinning can be used to generate a cylindrical matrix that matches the shape of the cord. Upon implantation in a completely transected rat spinal cord, matrices supplemented with NGF and chondroitinase ABC promote significant functional recovery. An examination of these matrices post-implantation shows that electrospun aligned monofilaments induce a more robust cellular infiltration than unaligned monofilaments. Further, a vascular network is generated in these matrices, with some endothelial cells using the electrospun fibres as a growth substrate. The presence of axons within these implanted matrices demonstrates that they facilitate axon regeneration following spinal cord injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of electrospinning to generate an aligned substrate that can provide trophic support, directional guidance cues and regeneration-inhibitory neutralizing compounds to regenerating axons following spinal cord injury.

Circulating bone formation markers are reduced and bone resorption markers are substantially elevated, indicating an uncoupling between osteoclast and osteoblast activity, possibly resulting in pronounced bone loss, impaired traumatic or surgical fracture healing, and osteoporosis. In addition, we have previously shown that increased circulating osteoclast precursors in critically ill patients result in increased osteoclastogenesis in vitro, possibly through Fc\u03b3RIII signaling. In the current study, we investigated the effects of sustained critical illness on bone metabolism at the tissue level in a standardized rabbit model of prolonged (7 days), burn injury-induced critical illness. This in vivo model showed a reduction in serum ionized calcium and osteocalcin levels, as is seen in humans.

{"title": "Tbx1 regulates brain vascularization.", "abstract": "The transcription factor TBX1 is the major gene involved in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). Using mouse models of these diseases, we have previously shown that TBX1 activates VEGFR3 in endothelial cells (EC), and that this interaction is critical for the development of the lymphatic vasculature. In this study, we show that TBX1 regulates brain angiogenesis. Using loss-of-function genetics and molecular approaches, we show that TBX1 regulates the VEGFR3 and DLL4 genes in brain ECs. In mice, loss of TBX1 causes global brain vascular defects, comprising brain vessel hyperplasia, enhanced angiogenic sprouting and vessel network disorganization. This phenotype is recapitulated in EC-specific Tbx1 conditional mutants and in an EC-only 3-dimensional cell culture system (matrigel), indicating that the brain vascular phenotype is cell autonomous. Furthermore, EC-specific conditional Tbx1 mutants have poorly perfused brain vessels and brain hypoxia, indicating that the expanded vascular network is functionally impaired. In EC-matrigel cultures, a Notch1 agonist is able to partially rescue microtubule hyperbranching induced by TBX1 knockdown. Thus, we have identified a novel transcriptional regulator of angiogenesis that exerts its effect in brain by negatively regulating angiogenesis through the DLL4/Notch1-VEGFR3 regulatory axis. Given the similarity of the phenotypic consequences of TBX1 mutation in humans and mice, this unexpected role of TBX1 in murine brain vascularization should stimulate clinicians to search for brain microvascular anomalies in 22q11.2DS patients and to evaluate whether some of the anatomical and functional brain anomalies in patients may have a microvascular origin.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2013-08-16", "authors": ["SaraCioffi", "StefaniaMartucciello", "Filomena GabriellaFulcoli", "MarchesaBilio", "RosaFerrentino", "EdoardoNusco", "ElizabethIllingworth"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddt400"}
{"title": "Cerebral ischaemia and matrix metalloproteinase-9 modulate the angiogenic function of early and late outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells.", "abstract": "The enhancement of endogenous angiogenesis after stroke will be critical in neurorepair therapies where endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) might be key players. Our aim was to determine the influence of cerebral ischaemia and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) on the angiogenic function of EPCs. Permanent focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in MMP-9/knockout (MMP-9/KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. EPCs were obtained for cell counting after ischaemia (6 and 24\u00a0hrs) and in control animals. Matrigel(\u2122) assays and time-lapse imaging were conducted to monitor angiogenic function of WT and MMP9-deficient EPCs or after treatment with MMP-9 inhibitors. Focal cerebral ischaemia increased the number of early EPCs, while MMP-9 deficiency decreased their number in non-ischaemic mice and delayed their release after ischaemia. Late outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) from ischaemic mice shaped more vessel structures than controls, while MMP-9 deficiency reduced the angiogenic abilities of OECs to form vascular networks, in vitro. Treatment with the MMP inhibitor GM6001 and the specific MMP-9 inhibitor I also decreased the number of vessel structures shaped by both human and mouse WT OECs, while exogenous MMP-9 could not revert the impaired angiogenic function in MMP-9/KO OECs. Finally, time-lapse imaging showed that the extension of vascular networks was influenced by cerebral ischaemia and MMP-9 deficiency early during the vascular network formation followed by a dynamic vessel remodelling.

{"title": "Interstitial fluid flow and drug delivery in vascularized tumors: a computational model.", "abstract": "Interstitial fluid is a solution that bathes and surrounds the human cells and provides them with nutrients and a way of waste removal. It is generally believed that elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is partly responsible for the poor penetration and distribution of therapeutic agents in solid tumors, but the complex interplay of extravasation, permeabilities, vascular heterogeneities and diffusive and convective drug transport remains poorly understood. Here we consider-with the help of a theoretical model-the tumor IFP, interstitial fluid flow (IFF) and its impact upon drug delivery within tumor depending on biophysical determinants such as vessel network morphology, permeabilities and diffusive vs. convective transport. We developed a vascular tumor growth model, including vessel co-option, regression, and angiogenesis, that we extend here by the interstitium (represented by a porous medium obeying Darcy's law) and sources (vessels) and sinks (lymphatics) for IFF. With it we compute the spatial variation of the IFP and IFF and determine its correlation with the vascular network morphology and physiological parameters like vessel wall permeability, tissue conductivity, distribution of lymphatics etc. We find that an increased vascular wall conductivity together with a reduction of lymph function leads to increased tumor IFP, but also that the latter does not necessarily imply a decreased extravasation rate: Generally the IF flow rate is positively correlated with the various conductivities in the system. The IFF field is then used to determine the drug distribution after an injection via a convection diffusion reaction equation for intra- and extracellular concentrations with parameters guided by experimental data for the drug Doxorubicin. We observe that the interplay of convective and diffusive drug transport can lead to quite unexpected effects in the presence of a heterogeneous, compartmentalized vasculature. Finally we discuss various strategies to increase drug exposure time of tumor cells.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-08-14", "authors": ["MichaelWelter", "HeikoRieger"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070395"}

We previously showed that soluble forms of uPAR elicit angiogenic responses through their uPAR\u2088\u2088\u208b\u2089\u2082 chemotactic sequence and that the synthetic peptide SRSRY exerts similar effects. By a drug design approach, based on the conformational analysis of the uPAR\u2088\u2088\u208b\u2089\u2082 sequence, we developed peptides (pERERY, RERY, and RERF) that potently inhibit signaling triggered by uPAR\u2088\u2088\u208b\u2089\u2082. In this study, we present evidence that these peptides are endowed also with a clear-cut antiangiogenic activity, although to different extents. The most active, RERF, prevents tube formation by human endothelial cells exposed to SRSRY. RERF also inhibits VEGF-triggered endothelial cell migration and cord-like formation in a dose-dependent manner, starting in the femtomolar range. RERF prevents F-actin polymerization, recruitment of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin at focal adhesions, and \u03b1v\u03b23/VEGFR2 complex formation in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF. At molecular level, the inhibitory effect of RERF on VEGF signaling is shown by the decreased amount of phospho-FAK and phospho-Akt in VEGF-treated cells. In vivo, RERF prevents VEGF-dependent capillary sprouts originating from the host vessels that invaded angioreactors implanted in mice and neovascularization induced by subcorneal implantation of pellets containing VEGF in rabbits. Consistently, RERF reduced the growth and vascularization rate of tumors formed by HT1080 cells injected subcutaneously in the flanks of nude mice, indicating that RERF is a promising therapeutic agent for the control of diseases fuelled by excessive angiogenesis such as cancer.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2013-08-14", "authors": ["KatiaBifulco", "ImmacolataLonganesi-Cattani", "EleonoraLiguori", "ClaudioArra", "DomenicaRea", "Maria TeresaMasucci", "MarioDe Rosa", "VincenzoPavone", "Maria PatriziaStoppelli", "Maria VincenzaCarriero"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0077"}

To determine the most appropriate technique for tumour followup in experimental therapeutics, we compared ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize ectopic and orthotopic colon carcinoma models. Methods. CT26 tumours were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) in Balb/c mice for the ectopic model or into the caecum for the orthotopic model. Tumours were evaluated by histology, spectrofluorescence, MRI, and US. Results. Histology of CT26 tumour showed homogeneously dispersed cancer cells and blood vessels. The visualization of the vascular network using labelled albumin showed that CT26 tumours were highly vascularized and disorganized. MRI allowed high-resolution and accurate 3D tumour measurements and provided additional anatomical and functional information. Noninvasive US imaging allowed good delineation of tumours despite an hypoechogenic signal. Monitoring of tumour growth with US could be accomplished as early as 5 days after implantation with a shorter acquisition time (<5\u2009min) compared to MRI. Conclusion. MRI and US afforded excellent noninvasive imaging techniques to accurately follow tumour growth of ectopic and orthotopic CT26 tumours.

Rodent MRSA pneumonia models mainly focus on the early innate immune responses to MRSA lung infection. However, the molecular pattern and mechanisms of recovery from MRSA lung infection are largely unknown. In this study, a sublethal mouse MRSA pneumonia model was employed to investigate late events during the recovery from MRSA lung infection. We compared lung bacterial clearance, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) characterization, lung histology, lung cell proliferation, lung vascular permeability and lung gene expression profiling between days 1 and 3 post MRSA lung infection. Compared to day 1 post infection, bacterial colony counts, BALF total cell number and BALF protein concentration significantly decreased at day 3 post infection. Lung cDNA microarray analysis identified 47 significantly up-regulated and 35 down-regulated genes (p<0.01, 1.5 fold change [up and down]). The pattern of gene expression suggests that lung recovery is characterized by enhanced cell division, vascularization, wound healing and adjustment of host adaptive immune responses. Proliferation assay by PCNA staining further confirmed that at day 3 lungs have significantly higher cell proliferation than at day 1. Furthermore, at day 3 lungs displayed significantly lower levels of vascular permeability to albumin, compared to day 1.

{"title": "In vivo fluorescence imaging reveals the promotion of mammary tumorigenesis by mesenchymal stromal cells.", "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells which are recruited to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and influence tumor progression through multiple mechanisms. In this study, we examined the effects of MSCs on the tunmorigenic capacity of 4T1 murine mammary cancer cells. It was found that MSC-conditioned medium increased the proliferation, migration, and efficiency of mammosphere formation of 4T1 cells in vitro. When co-injected with MSCs into the mouse mammary fat pad, 4T1 cells showed enhanced tumor growth and generated increased spontaneous lung metastasis. Using in vivo fluorescence color-coded imaging, the interaction between GFP-expressing MSCs and RFP-expressing 4T1 cells was monitored. As few as five 4T1 cells could give rise to tumor formation when co-injected with MSCs into the mouse mammary fat pad, but no tumor was formed when five or ten 4T1 cells were implanted alone. The elevation of tumorigenic potential was further supported by gene expression analysis, which showed that when 4T1 cells were in contact with MSCs, several oncogenes, cancer markers, and tumor promoters were upregulated. Moreover, in vivo longitudinal fluorescence imaging of tumorigenesis revealed that MSCs created a vascularized environment which enhances the ability of 4T1 cells to colonize and proliferate. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the promotion of mammary cancer progression by MSCs was achieved through the generation of a cancer-enhancing microenvironment to increase tumorigenic potential. These findings also suggest the potential risk of enhancing tumor progression in clinical cell therapy using MSCs.

There were no significant differences between the normalized ultimate strength and stiffness in the groups, but they tended to be higher in the motor ES group.

Nevertheless, fibrin presents a complex milieu of signals to embedded cells, many of which are not well understood. Synthetic extracellular matrices (ECMs) provide a blank slate that can ostensibly be populated with specific bioactive cues, including growth factors, growth factor binding motifs, adhesive peptides and peptide crosslinks susceptible to proteases, thereby enabling a degree of customization for specific applications. However, the continued evolution and improvement of synthetic ECMs requires parallel efforts to deconstruct native ECMs and decipher the cues they provide to constituent cells.

Western blot analysis revealed that NPY treatment caused a 52 \u00b1 14% increase in VEGF expression in the 4T1 cells compared to non-treated controls. Using selective NPY Y-receptor agonists (Y1R, Y2R and Y5R) we observed an increase in VEGF expression only when cells were treated with Y5R agonist. Congruently, using selective Y1R, Y2R, or Y5R antagonists, NPY-induced increases in VEGF expression in 4T1 cells were attenuated only under Y5R antagonism. Endothelial tube formation assays were conducted using conditioned media (CM) from NPY treated 4T1 cells. Concentration-dependent increases in number of branch points and complete endothelial networks were observed in HUVEC exposed to NPY CM. CM from Y5R agonist treated 4T1 cells caused similar increases in number of branch points and complete endothelial networks. VEGF concentration was quantified in CM (ELISA) from agonist experiments; we observed a 2-fold and 2.5-fold increase in VEGF release from NPY and Y5R agonist treated 4T1 cells respectively.

In this study, the relationship between Gleason score and vascular characteristics of needle biopsy samples in prostate cancer patients has been evaluated.\nWe evaluated vascular characteristics including density and size of vessels; and percentage of vessels with irregular shape in 62 cancer-positive samples obtained by prostate needle biopsy under ultrasound guide, and compared them to Gleason score.\nGleason scores of 23 patients were \u22646; Gleason scores of 18 patients were 7 and 21 patients had their Gleason score from 8 to 10. An increase in Gleason score was associated with increased vascular density (P < 0.0001), increased percentage of vessels with irregular shape (P < 0.02) and decreased average vascular diameter (P < 0.015), from which the relationship with vascular density was clearer and more evident.\nVascular morphological characteristics can be representative of angiogenic potential of prostate cancer which is required for tumor progression. As Gleason score can prognosticate the behavioral characteristics of prostate cancer in future, vascular characteristics may also be able to express tumor behavior.

However, current antiangiogenic therapy induces serious adverse effects including neuronal cytotoxicity and tumor invasiveness and resistance to therapy. Although it has been suggested that the physical microenvironment has a key role in tumor angiogenesis and progression, the mechanism by which physical properties of extracellular matrix control tumor angiogenesis and glioblastoma progression is not completely understood. Herein we show that physical compaction (the process in which cells gather and pack together and cause associated changes in cell shape and size) of human glioblastoma cell lines U87MG, U251, and LN229 induces expression of collagen types IV and VI and the collagen crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase and up-regulates in vitro expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor. The lysyl oxidase inhibitor \u03b2-aminopropionitrile disrupts collagen structure in the tumor and inhibits tumor angiogenesis and glioblastoma multiforme growth in a mouse orthotopic brain tumor model. Similarly, d-penicillamine, which inhibits lysyl oxidase enzymatic activity by depleting intracerebral copper, also exhibits antiangiogenic effects on brain tumor growth in mice.

Acoustic radiation forces associated with ultrasound standing wave fields can rapidly and non-invasively organize cells into distinct multicellular planar bands within three-dimensional collagen gels.

{"title": "Growing vascularized heart tissue from stem cells.", "abstract": "The promise of stem cells to repair the heart after damage or heart attack has not been realized because most such cells are lost after transplantation. A new approach is to grow substantial viable pieces of cardiac tissue from human stem cells by cardiac tissue engineering. Such constructs must be fully vascularized and perfused to ensure the viability of clinically relevant volumes of tissue. This requires careful choice of cells, culture conditions, a biomaterial to act as scaffold, and crucial strategies for vascularization. Autologous stem cells with high plasticity, which would avoid the need for antirejection therapies after transplantation, are an attractive source of both cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. Most stem cells also have inherent paracrine activity, releasing cytoprotective factors and growth-promoting cytokines that can further stimulate tissue regeneration and neovascularization through recruitment of endogenous stem and progenitor cells. Current advances for growing vascularized and functional cardiac constructs with human stem cells are described, bringing us a step closer to the engineering of complex cardiac tissues such as pacemaker, conducting tissue, or contractile myocardial flaps ideal for transplantation.

Expansion of the restriction reconstructs the defect and creates a vascularized scaffold with micro-openings that are seeded with lipografts. Wide subcutaneous cuts that lead to macrocavities and subsequent graft failure are avoided. Postoperatively, a splint to hold open the neomatrix/graft construct in its expansive state is applied until the grafts mature. Thirty-one patients underwent one to three operations (average, two) for defects that normally require flap tissue transfer: wounds where primary closure was not possible (n=9), contour defects of the trunk and breast requiring large-volume fat grafts (n=8), burn contractures (n=5), radiation scars (n=6), and congenital constriction bands (n=3).\nThe regenerated tissue was similar in texture and consistency to the surrounding tissues. Wider meshed areas had greater tissue gain (range, 20 to 30 percent). There were no significant wound-healing issues, scars, or donor-site morbidities. Advancement tension was relieved without flap undermining or decreased perfusion.\nRealizing that, whether scar or endogenous fascia, the subdermal aponeurosis limits tissue stretch and/or its three-dimensional expansion, a minimally invasive procedure that expands this cicatrix into a matrix ideally suited for fat micrografts was developed.

We have previously shown that type 2 diabetic rats exhibit enhanced dysfunctional cerebral neovascularization and when these rats are subjected to cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury develop hemorrhagic transformation and greater neurological deficits. However, our knowledge of vascular and functional plasticity during the recovery phase of diabetic stroke is limited. This study tested the hypothesis that vascular repair is impaired in the poststroke period in diabetes mellitus, and this is associated with poor sensorimotor and cognitive function. We further hypothesized that glycemic control prevents impaired vascularization and improves functional outcome in diabetes mellitus.\nVascularization was assessed in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres in control, diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus plus metformin groups 14 days after ischemic reperfusion injury, as well as in respective sham controls. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-stained vasculature was achieved by confocal microscopy, and stereological parameters, including vascular volume and surface area, were measured. Astrogliosis was determined by glial fibrillary acidic protein staining. The relative rates of sensorimotor recovery, cognitive decline, and spontaneous activity were assessed.\nVascular density in the peri-infarct area was significantly reduced in diabetes mellitus, whereas there was reparative neovascularization in control rats. Astroglial swelling and reactivity were more pronounced in diabetic stroke compared with control stroke. Diabetes mellitus blunted sensorimotor recovery and also exacerbated anxiety-like symptoms and cognitive deficits.

{"title": "Co-culture of human bone marrow stromal cells with endothelial cells alters gene expression profiles.", "abstract": "The intricate relationship between angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vivo must be replicated in bone tissue engineering constructs to ensure the formation of a functional vascular network to support successful bone formation. Although communication between bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) and endothelial cells (EC) is recognized as one of the most important cellular interactions in bone regeneration, the underlying mechanisms of this biological process are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to analyze global gene expression associated with intercellular communication between MSC and EC using HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression BeadChips with a one-channel platform system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Each array contains more than 48,000 probes derived from human genes. A global map of MSC gene expression was generated following co-culture of MSC with EC for 5 and 15 days, in a direct-contact model. The map was used to determine relative alterations in functional processes and pathways. Co-culturing EC with MSC up-regulated genes related to angiogenesis as von Willebrand factor, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, cadherin 5, angiopoietin-related protein 4, and cell surface antigen CD34, and genes playing important roles in osteogenesis as alkaline phosphatase, FK506 binding protein 5, and bone morphogenetic protein.

An intriguing question relates to the observation that pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, and preeclampsia remain major complications in SLE pregnancies, not substantially altered by improved therapy and monitoring.\nFrom the review of the recent literature on the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss, IUGR, preeclampsia, and prematurity, it appears that clinical or subclinical inflammation, presence of autoantibodies, hormonal dysfunction, and immune alterations of lupus contribute to pregnancy complications. Impairment of early placenta development leads to poor vascularization, resulting in placental ischemia and subsequent endothelial damage. Depending on the extent of the pathological process, pregnancy loss, IUGR, and preeclampsia can develop.\nEarly recognition of pregnancy complications is desirable in order to prevent their development or to prompt intervention that improves the outcomes. Several biomarkers have been investigated for their ability to predict complications at an early stage of pregnancy. However, up to date only lupus anticoagulant has emerged as a consistent predictor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.", "journal": "Current opinion in rheumatology", "date": "2013-08-07", "authors": ["MonikaOstensen", "MeganClowse"], "doi": "10.1097/BOR.0b013e328363ebf7"}

Because full facial procurement is time-intensive, \"simultaneous-start\" procurement could entail VCA ischemia over 12 h. We procured a total face osteomyocutaneous VCA from a brain-dead donor. Bedside tracheostomy and facial mask impression were performed preoperative day 1. Solid organ recovery included heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Facial dissection time was 12 h over 15 h to diminish ischemia while awaiting recipient preparation. Solid organ recovery began at 13.5 h, during midfacial osteotomies, and concluded immediately after facial explantation. Facial thoracic and abdominal teams worked concurrently. Estimated blood loss was 1300 mL, requiring five units of pRBC and two units FFP. Urine output, MAP, pH and PaO2 remained normal. All organs had good postoperative function. We propose an algorithm that allows \"face first, concurrent completion\" recovery of a complex facial VCA by planning multiple pathways to expedient recovery of vital organs in the event of clinical instability.

The method included preparation of the macroscopic collection report, perfusion of the arterial network with water, injection of colored latex, fixation in formaldehyde, and preservation in ethanol. For our description and analyses, we performed dissections under mesoscopic light and made photo documentation of our observations. The large intestine of T. tetradactyla is irrigated by the caudal mesenteric artery (rectum, left colic fold, descending colon and transverse colon) and cranial mesenteric artery (right colic fold, cecal pouch). We observed that the large intestine in these animals is implied in the abdominal wall without becoming affixed to the wall, or developing adhesions on individual segments. The caudal mesenteric artery feeds the straight collateral branches (primary, secondary, and tertiary) and a few juxtacolic arched branches (first and second order). The straight branches emerge from the arched branches, bifurcate, and embrace the intestinal loop to irrigate it. The presence of anastomoses between the CaMA and the CrMA apparently ensures a relatively stable flow in the event of failure of either. This is very important, as the peritoneum in this species is completely dependent on blood from these two arteries. The model of vascularization and fixation of the large intestine into the abdominal wall of T. tetradactyla is different from that in other vertebrates.", "journal": "Zoological science", "date": "2013-08-07", "authors": ["Amanda RochaMortoza", "Lorenna CardosoRezende", "Carina da CostaOliveira", "Jussara RochaFerreira"], "doi": "10.2108/zsj.30.670"}

Previously, cell isolation devices have been based on hollow fiber membranes, porous polymer scaffolds, alginate systems, or micro-machined membranes. We present the development and characterization of a novel dual porosity electrospun membrane based device, which supports cellular infiltration and vascularization of its outer porous layer and maintains cellular isolation within a lumen bounded by an inner low porosity layer. Electrospinning conditions were initially established to support electrospun fiber deposition onto nonconductive silicone surfaces. With these parameters established, devices for in vivo evaluations were produced using nylon as a nonconductive scaffold for deposition of dual porosity electrospun fibers. The outer porous layer supported the development of a penetrating microcirculation and the membrane supported the transfer of insulin from encapsulated sustained release pellets for 4 weeks. Viable cells implanted within the device could be identified after 2 weeks of implantation. Through the successful demonstration of survival and cellular isolation of human epithelial cells within the implanted devices and the ability to use the device to deliver insulin, we have established the utility of this device toward localized cell transplantation. The cell delivery device establishes a platform to test the feasibility of approaches to cell dose control and cell localization at the site of implantation in the clinical use of modified autologous or allogeneic cells.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Vascular remodeling in cancer.", "abstract": "The growth and dissemination of tumors rely on an altered vascular network, which supports their survival and expansion and provides accessibility to the vasculature and a route of transport for metastasizing tumor cells. The remodeling of vascular structures through generation of new vessels (for example, via tumor angiogenesis) is a well studied, even if still quite poorly understood, process in human cancer. Antiangiogenic therapies have provided insight into the contribution of angiogenesis to the biology of human tumors, yet have also revealed the ease with which resistance to antiangiogenic drugs can develop, presumably involving alterations to vascular signaling mechanisms. Furthermore, cellular and/or molecular changes to pre-existing vessels could represent subtle pre-metastatic alterations to the vasculature, which are important for cancer progression. These changes, and associated molecular markers, may forecast the behavior of individual tumors and contribute to the early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.

Mice carrying floxed alleles of the nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain gene (NMHC IIA(flox/flox)) were crossed with the K5-Cre line. The progeny of newborn pups did not show a Mendelian genotype distribution, suggesting embryonic lethality. Analysis of post-implantation conceptuses from embryonic day (E)9.5 to E13.5 revealed poorly developed embryos and defective placentas, with significantly reduced labyrinth surface area and blood vessel vascularization. These results suggested the novel possibility that the bovine K5 promoter-driven Cre-recombinase was active early in trophoblast-lineage cells that give rise to the placenta. To test this possibility, K5-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with the mT/mG reporter mouse in which activation of GFP expression indicates Cre transgene expression. We observed activation of K5-Cre-driven GFP expression in the ectoplacental cone, in the extraembryonic ectoderm, and in trophoblast giant cells in the E6.5 embryo. In addition, we observed GFP expression at E11.5 to E13.5 in both the labyrinth of the placenta and the yolk sac. NMIIA expression was detected in these same cell types in normal embryos, as well as in E13.5 yolk sac and labyrinth. These findings taken together suggest that NMHC IIA may play critical roles in the early trophoblast-derived ectoplacental cone and extraembryonic ectoderm, as well as in the yolk sac and labyrinth tissues that form later. Our findings are consistent with phenotypes of constitutive NMIIA knockout mice made earlier, that displayed labyrinth and yolk sac-specific defects, but our findings extend those observations by suggesting possible NMIIA roles in trophoblast lineages as well. These results furthermore demonstrate that K5-Cre gene constructs, previously reported to be activated starting at approximately E12.5 in the forming epidermis, may be widely useful as drivers for activation of cre/lox based gene excision in early embryo extraembronic trophoblast tissues as well.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2013-08-06", "authors": ["JamesCrish", "Mary AnneConti", "TakaoSakai", "Robert SAdelstein", "Thomas TEgelhoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.07.017"}

Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) has recently been introduced as a treatment option for both pediatric and adult craniopharyngiomas. The object of the present study was to present the results of EES and analyze outcome in both the pediatric and the adult age groups.\nThe authors retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with craniopharyngioma who had undergone EES in the period from June 1999 to April 2011.\nSixty-four patients, 47 adults and 17 children, were eligible for this study. Forty-seven patients had presented with primary craniopharyngiomas and 17 with recurrent tumors. The mean age in the adult group was 51 years (range 28-82 years); in the pediatric group, 9 years (range 4-18 years). Overall, the gross-total resection rate was 37.5% (24 patients); near-total resection (> 95% of tumor removed) was 34.4% (22 patients); subtotal resection (\u2265 80% of tumor removed) 21.9% (14 patients); and partial resection (< 80% of tumor removed) 6.2% (4 patients). In 9 patients, EES had been combined with radiation therapy (with radiosurgery in 6 cases) as the initial treatment. Among the 40 patients (62.5%) who had presented with pituitary insufficiency, pituitary function remained unchanged in 19 (47.5%), improved or normalized in 8 (20%), and worsened in 13 (32.5%). In the 24 patients who had presented with normal pituitary function, new pituitary deficit occurred in 14 (58.3%). Nineteen patients (29.7%) suffered from diabetes insipidus at presentation, and the condition developed in 21 patients (46.7%) after treatment. Forty-four patients (68.8%) had presented with impaired vision. In 38 (86.4%) of them, vision improved or even normalized after surgery; in 5, it remained unchanged; and in 1, it temporarily worsened. One patient without preoperative visual problems showed temporary visual deterioration after treatment. Permanent visual deterioration occurred in no one after surgery. The mean follow-up was 38 months (range 1-135 months). Tumor recurrence after EES was discovered in 22 patients (34.4%) and was treated with repeat surgery (6 patients), radiosurgery (1 patient), combined repeat surgery and radiation therapy (8 patients), interferon (1 patient), or observation (6 patients). Surgical complications included 15 cases (23.4%) with CSF leakage that was treated with surgical reexploration (13 patients) and/or lumbar drain placement (9 patients). This leak rate was decreased to 10.6% in recent years after the introduction of the vascularized nasoseptal flap. Five cases (7.8%) of meningitis were found and treated with antibiotics without further complications. Postoperative hydrocephalus occurred in 7 patients (12.7%) and was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Five patients experienced transient cranial nerve palsies. There was no operative mortality.\nWith the goal of gross-total or maximum possible safe resection, EES can be used for the treatment of every craniopharyngioma, regardless of its location, size, and extension (excluding purely intraventricular tumors), and can provide acceptable results comparable to those for traditional craniotomies.

This report aimed to present the clinical results of the use of a modified surgical technique of FVFG for treatment of ONFH. Four hundred and seven patients with 578 hips of ONFH were included. The patients' average age was 36.7 years old (ranging 19-55 years old). The disease was staged from II to V based on the Steinberg classification system. By the modified procedure, the vascularized fibular graft was harvested via a lateral incision with fibular osteotomy prior to the exposure of the vascular pedicle, and the removal of necrotic tissue and inset of graft were performed through an anterior approach. The operative time averaged 90 min for unilateral ONFH (ranging 75-110 min) and 190 min for simultaneous treatment of bilateral ONFH (ranging 160-230 min). The average length of follow-up was 5.0 years (ranging 3-10 years). The complications included one infection in one case, temporary loss of sensation of the thigh in eleven cases, and restricted motion of the great toe in nine cases. The Harris hip score of patients improved from 65.0 to 86.9 on average.

In the present study, \u03b23-AR expression in mouse B16F10 melanoma cells was demonstrated and the effects of two widely used \u03b23-AR blockers, SR59230A and L-748,337, were evaluated in comparison with propranolol, a \u03b21-/\u03b22-AR blocker with poor affinity for \u03b23-ARs, and with siRNAs targeting specific \u03b2-ARs.

SR59230A or L-748,337 treatment also resulted in significant decrease of the tumor vasculature. The decrease in tumor vasculature was due to apoptosis of endothelial cells and not to downregulation of angiogenic factors. These results demonstrate that SR59230A and L-748,337 significantly inhibit melanoma growth by reducing tumor cell proliferation and activating tumor cell death.

As a result, several targeting agents are being investigated. However, the efficacy of current regimens is generally insufficient for their toxicity and poor overall response rates. We have recently reported that naftopidil exerts growth-inhibitory effects on human prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms by which naftopidil produces growth-inhibitory and antiangiogenic effects on RCC. We first tested the effects of naftopidil on the proliferation of ACHN and Caki-2 RCC cells. Next, we set up a model simulating the tumor microenvironment, in which ACHN cells were grafted onto the renal capsule of mice. We then tested the effects of naftopidil on human umbilical vein endothelial cells' cell proliferation and Matrigel plug vascularization. Finally, to establish the antitumor activity of naftopidil on RCC, we tested the antitumor effects of naftopidil on excised tumor specimens from 20 patients with RCC that were grafted beneath the renal capsule of mice. Naftopidil showed similar in vitro growth-inhibitory effects on all cell lines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed an increase in G1 cell-cycle arrest in all naftopidil-treated cell lines. In vivo tumorigenic studies showed a significant reduction of ACHN tumor weight, Ki-67 index, and microvessel density (MVD) in naftopidil-treated mice. Naftopidil attenuated neovascularization in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay. Studies in mouse xenograft models also showed a significant MVD reduction in naftopidil-treated excised human RCC.

{"title": "Additive effect of mesenchymal stem cells and VEGF to vascularization of PLGA scaffolds.", "abstract": "Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSCs) are widely used for the generation of tissue engineering constructs, since they can differentiate into different cell types occurring in bone tissues. Until now their use for the generation of tissue engineering constructs is limited. All cells inside a tissue engineering construct die within a short period of time after implantation of the construct because vascularization and establishment of connections to the recipient circulatory system is a time consuming process. We therefore compared the influences of bmMSC, VEGF and a combination of both on the early processes of vascularization, utilizing the mice skinfold chamber model and intravital fluorescence microscopy. Tissue engineering constructs based on collagen coated Poly d,l-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) scaffolds, were either functionalized by coating with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or vitalized with bmMSC. PLGA without cells and growth factor was used as the control group. Functionalized and vitalized tissue engineering constructs showed an accelerated growth of microvessels compared to controls. Only marginal differences in vascular growth were detected between VEGF containing and bmMSC containing constructs. Constructs containing VEGF and bmMSC showed a further enhanced microvascular growth at day 14. We conclude that bmMSCs are well suited for bone tissue engineering applications, since they are a valuable source of angiogenic growth factors and are able to differentiate into the tissue specific cell types of interest. The dynamic process of vascularization triggered by growth factor producing cells can be amplified and stabilized with the addition of accessory growth factors, leading to a persisting angiogenesis, but strategies are needed that enhance the resistance of bmMSC to hypoxia and increase survival of these cells until the tissue engineering construct has build up a functional vascular system.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2013-08-01", "authors": ["AndreasKampmann", "DanielLindhorst", "PaulSchumann", "R\u00fcdigerZimmerer", "HorstKokem\u00fcller", "MartinR\u00fccker", "Nils-ClaudiusGellrich", "FrankTavassol"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2013.07.006"}

Recently a number of clinical investigations are being undertaken to assess the potential therapeutic application of various anti-angiogenic agents. Many of these angiogenesis inhibitors are directed against the functions of endothelial cells, which are considered as the building blocks of blood vessels. Similarly, roots of a traditional medicinal plant, Eurycoma longifolia, can be used as an alternative treatment to prevent and treat the angiogenesis-related diseases. In the present study, antiangiogenic potential of partially purified quassinoid-rich fraction (TAF273) of E. longifolia root extract was evaluated using ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis models and the anti-angiogenic efficacy of TAF273 was investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). TAF273 caused significant suppression in sprouting of microvessels in rat aorta with IC50 11.5\u03bcg/ml. TAF273 (50\u03bcg/ml) showed remarkable inhibition (63.13%) of neovascularization in chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo. Tumor histology also revealed marked reduction in extent of vascularization. In vitro, TAF273 significantly inhibited the major angiogenesis steps such as proliferation, migration and differentiation of HUVECs. Phytochemical analysis revealed high content of quassinoids in TAF273. Specially, HPLC characterization showed that TAF273 is enriched with eurycomanone, 13\u03b1(21)-epoxyeurycomanone and eurycomanol. These results demonstrated that the antiangiogenic activity of TAF273 may be due to its inhibitory effect on endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration which could be attributed to the high content of quassinoids in E. longifolia.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2013-08-01", "authors": ["Omar Saeed AliAl-Salahi", "ChanKit-Lam", "Amin Malik Shah AbdulMajid", "Fouad Saleih RAl-Suede", "Sultan AyeshMohammed Saghir", "Wan ZaidahAbdullah", "Mohamed B KhadeerAhamed", "Narazah MohdYusoff"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2013.07.007"}

Despite pleiotropic effects on cells, the role of these epoxyeicosanoids in normal organ and tissue regeneration remains unknown. EETs are produced predominantly in the endothelium. Normal organ and tissue regeneration require an active paracrine role of the microvascular endothelium, which in turn depends on angiogenic growth factors. Thus, we hypothesize that endothelial cells stimulate organ and tissue regeneration via production of bioactive EETs. To determine whether endothelial-derived EETs affect physiologic tissue growth in vivo, we used genetic and pharmacological tools to manipulate endogenous EET levels. We show that endothelial-derived EETs play a critical role in accelerating tissue growth in vivo, including liver regeneration, kidney compensatory growth, lung compensatory growth, wound healing, corneal neovascularization, and retinal vascularization. Administration of synthetic EETs recapitulated these results, whereas lowering EET levels, either genetically or pharmacologically, delayed tissue regeneration, demonstrating that pharmacological modulation of EETs can affect normal organ and tissue growth. We also show that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, which elevate endogenous EET levels, promote liver and lung regeneration.

Part 2 of this two-part study is focused on the clinical outcomes following a more anatomical approach to extensor tendon reconstruction.\nNine patients (eight male and one female), with a mean age of 31.7 years, underwent free vascularized joint transfer for posttraumatic proximal interphalangeal joint injuries using the second toe proximal interphalangeal joint. In Part 1, two arrangements of the central slip mechanism were found: type I with an attenuated and type II with a distinct central slip. An algorithm was constructed using this information: in a type I toe with sufficient recipient lateral bands, a centralization procedure was carried out; and when the lateral bands were insufficient, a modified Stack procedure was carried out. In type II toe joints, a tight repair of the corresponding extensor tendons was performed.\nFour patients underwent centralization procedures, two underwent a modified Stack procedure, and three underwent tight extensor repair. At 23.4 months, the average extensor lag was 18.3 degrees. A total range of motion of 53.9 degrees (mean flexion, 72.2 degrees) was achieved that approximated 81.1 percent of the pretransfer passive range of motion at the toe proximal interphalangeal joint.\nThis preliminary result demonstrates that much improved range of motion can be achieved by reducing the extensor lag using an anatomical reconstruction that takes into account the recipient finger and toe joint anatomy.\nTherapeutic, IV.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2013-07-31", "authors": ["Wee-LeonLam", "NicholasWaughlock", "Chung-ChengHsu", "Yu-TeLin", "Fu-ChanWei"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e31829589db"}

Similar observations were performed in nine clinical cases.

In four toes, a thicker tendinous insertion analogous to a central slip was identified (type II). In type I toes, traction of the extensor digitorum brevis and digitorum longus did not correct the extensor lag. The extension lag decreased when the metatarsophalangeal joint was flexed passively or when both extrinsic and intrinsic tendons were pulled simultaneously. In type II toes, a full extension of the proximal interphalangeal joint was achieved when the extensor tendons were pulled with or without pulling the intrinsic tendons. In both types of toes, there was an increase in the extension lag caused by dorsal bowstringing when separated from the extensor sling.\nThe lesser toe proximal interphalangeal joint adopts a naturally flexed posture for evolutionary reasons, with corresponding adaptations in extensor mechanism arrangements.

Chi-square analysis was performed for complications versus body mass index of 35 or higher, cancer or prophylactic mastectomy, permanent implant or tissue expander, and history of smoking. Overall complications were associated with body mass index greater than 35 (p=0.035) and prior smoking (p=0.0001).

An evaluation of the size of an angiosome by conducting intraoperative angiography is proposed. Intraoperative angiography is performed after injection of indocyanine green.

Various routes have enabled accessing the precentral cerebellar fissure and the posterior incisural space.\nWe review the occipital interhemispheric transtentorial (OITT) technique, its advantages and limitations for treatment of such AVMs. We present a case series of six superior vermian, superomedian cerebellar, or tectal AVMs approached via the OITT route and present a detailed review of the literature.\nGiven the exposure from the posterior incisura to the torcula heterophili, the superior cerebellar arteries, the nidus and the draining veins are all in view and can be managed sequentially. The OITT approach is appropriate for the treatment of these AVMs if they are located midline or paramedian and vascularized preferentially by the rostral branches of the superior cerebellar arteries. For AVMs extending beyond midline, deep to the fourth ventricles, or caudally to the cerebellar tonsils; and/or vascularized by caudal branches of the superior cerebellar arteries, anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and/or posterior inferior cerebellar arteries; or having an aneurysm on any of these arteries, the OITT alone may not be appropriate. Preoperative embolization can target contralateral, deep, and caudal feeders or aneurysms, potentially rendering the OITT a favorable route. The OITT can also be combined with other approaches for AVMs that extend caudally with multiple feeders.\nThe OITT is a valuable approach for specific superior vermian, superomedian cerebellar, and tectal AVMs. Detailed assessment of angiographic features may however preclude its safety as a unique treatment plan, and complementary or alternative therapeutic options should be considered.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2013-07-31", "authors": ["NancyMcLaughlin", "Neil AMartin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2013.07.075"}

Mesenchymal stem cells stimulate angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo but it is not known if these proangiogenic properties change as a result of chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation. We investigated the angiogenic/antiangiogenic properties of equine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eBMSCs) before and after differentiation in vitro. Conditioned media from chondrogenic and osteogenic cell pellets and undifferentiated cells was applied to endothelial tube formation assays using Matrigel\u2122. Additionally, the cell secretome was analysed using LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and screened for angiogenesis and neurogenesis-related factors using protein arrays. Endothelial tube-like formation was supported by conditioned media from undifferentiated eBMSCs. Conversely, chondrogenic and osteogenic conditioned media was antiangiogenic as shown by significantly decreased length of endothelial tube-like structures and degree of branching compared to controls. Undifferentiated cells produced higher levels of angiogenesis-related proteins compared to chondrogenic and osteogenic pellets. In summary, eBMSCs produce an array of angiogenesis-related proteins and support angiogenesis in vitro via a paracrine mechanism. However, when these cells are differentiated chondrogenically or osteogenically, they produce a soluble factor(s) that inhibits angiogenesis. With respect to osteochondral tissue engineering, this may be beneficial for avascular articular cartilage formation but unfavourable for bone formation where a vascularized tissue is desired.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

For these reasons, in this study we intend to deepen in the characterization of the arborescent group of Blechnum with a review of eight species: B. brasiliense, B. columbiense, B. cycadifolium, B. magellanicum, B. moritzianum, B. schomburgkii, B. tabulare and B. werckleanum.Type material and several collections from diverse herbaria were studied. For morphological studies we used both herbarium and fresh material collected by the authors in fieldwork between 2005 and 2010. Rhizomes, stipes, vascularization of costae, as well as several characters of the lamina, such as outline, division, venation, margin structure, epidermal patterns, stomata, presence and types ofhypodermis, and mesophyll ofpinnae were studied. Important aspects of the morphology of the sporophyte have been analyzed, and external characters have been correlated with internal diagnostic ones to use the most reliable external traits in keys and descriptions. Taxonomy has been updated, and corrections have been introduced to the species nomenclature and comments were included to summarize the current knowledge of the geographical distribution and ecology. The presence of B. tabulare in America is confirmed, and the taxonomy of the species is updated, since external and internal morphology indicated that other related, American and African species, such as B. spannagelii and B. madagascariense must be included under that name. Similar studies carried out on B. schomburgkii indicated that the name is a synonym of B. auratum subsp. auratum, while B. auratum subsp. columbiense is treated here as a well characterized species. Detailed study of numerous specimens allowed to characterize B. moritzianum, being the correct name to apply to the recently described B. yungense.

{"title": "Long bone histology and growth patterns in ankylosaurs: implications for life history and evolution.", "abstract": "The ankylosaurs are one of the major dinosaur groups and are characterized by unique body armor. Previous studies on other dinosaur taxa have revealed growth patterns, life history and evolutionary mechanisms based on their long bone histology. However, to date nothing is known about long bone histology in the Ankylosauria. This study is the first description of ankylosaurian long bone histology based on several limb elements, which were sampled from different individuals from the Ankylosauridae and Nodosauridae. The histology is compared to that of other dinosaur groups, including other Thyreophora and Sauropodomorpha. Ankylosaur long bone histology is characterized by a fibrolamellar bone architecture. The bone matrix type in ankylosaurs is closest to that of Stegosaurus. A distinctive mixture of woven and parallel-fibered bone together with overall poor vascularization indicates slow growth rates compared to other dinosaurian taxa. Another peculiar characteristic of ankylosaur bone histology is the extensive remodeling in derived North American taxa. In contrast to other taxa, ankylosaurs substitute large amounts of their primary tissue early in ontogeny. This anomaly may be linked to the late ossification of the ankylosaurian body armor. Metabolically driven remodeling processes must have liberated calcium to ossify the protective osteodermal structures in juveniles to subadult stages, which led to further remodeling due to increased mechanical loading. Abundant structural fibers observed in the primary bone and even in remodeled bone may have improved the mechanical properties of the Haversian bone.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-07-31", "authors": ["MartinaStein", "ShojiHayashi", "P MartinSander"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0068590"}

Here, we described the use of vvDD-SR-RFP, a recombinant vaccinia virus, in xenograft and syngeneic models of colorectal PC. Colorectal cancer cell lines were highly susceptible to vvDD-SR-RFP replication and cytotoxicity. Intraperitoneal delivery of vvDD-SR-RFP on Day 12 to mice with colorectal carcinomatosis significantly improved survival whereas survival was not improved following virus treatment on Day 8, when tumors were smaller. Immunohistochemistry revealed early tumors had a poorly distributed network of blood vessels and lower proliferation index compared to later tumors. Virus infection was also restricted to tumor rims following Day 8 treatment, whereas it was disseminated in tumors treated on Day 12. Additionally, direct infection of tumor endothelium was observed and virus infection correlated with a loss of endothelial staining and induction of cell death. Our results demonstrate that tumor vasculature has a critical role in virus delivery and tumor response.

We found that by changing the polymer's molecular weight and composition, we could control microsphere loading, release and size. The BMP2 released from PLGA microspheres retained its biological activity and increased osteoblastic marker expression in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Uncapped PLGA microspheres were conjugated to ZrO2 scaffolds using carbodiimide chemistry, and the composite scaffold was shown to support hMSCs growth. We also demonstrated that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) can be co-cultured with hMSCs on the ZrO2 scaffold for future vascularization of the scaffold.

{"title": "Printing thermoresponsive reverse molds for the creation of patterned two-component hydrogels for 3D cell culture.", "abstract": "Bioprinting is an emerging technology that has its origins in the rapid prototyping industry. The different printing processes can be divided into contact bioprinting(1-4) (extrusion, dip pen and soft lithography), contactless bioprinting(5-7) (laser forward transfer, ink-jet deposition) and laser based techniques such as two photon photopolymerization(8). It can be used for many applications such as tissue engineering(9-13), biosensor microfabrication(14-16) and as a tool to answer basic biological questions such as influences of co-culturing of different cell types(17). Unlike common photolithographic or soft-lithographic methods, extrusion bioprinting has the advantage that it does not require a separate mask or stamp. Using CAD software, the design of the structure can quickly be changed and adjusted according to the requirements of the operator. This makes bioprinting more flexible than lithography-based approaches. Here we demonstrate the printing of a sacrificial mold to create a multi-material 3D structure using an array of pillars within a hydrogel as an example. These pillars could represent hollow structures for a vascular network or the tubes within a nerve guide conduit. The material chosen for the sacrificial mold was poloxamer 407, a thermoresponsive polymer with excellent printing properties which is liquid at 4 \u00b0C and a solid above its gelation temperature ~20 \u00b0C for 24.5% w/v solutions(18). This property allows the poloxamer-based sacrificial mold to be eluted on demand and has advantages over the slow dissolution of a solid material especially for narrow geometries. Poloxamer was printed on microscope glass slides to create the sacrificial mold. Agarose was pipetted into the mold and cooled until gelation. After elution of the poloxamer in ice cold water, the voids in the agarose mold were filled with alginate methacrylate spiked with FITC labeled fibrinogen.

One theory of BP-ONJ etiology suggests a negative influence of these agents on angiogenesis and vascularization. This in vivo study analyzed the effects of bisphosphonates on angiogenesis in a 3D Matrigel assay.\nMatrigel plugs were implanted into fifty 6-8-week-old female nude mice. Ten animals each were treated either with clodronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, zoledronate, or carrier solution as controls. The microvessel density (MVD), microvessel area (MVA), and microvessel size (MVS) in Matrigel plugs were analyzed after 21 days of treatment by immunohistochemistry and exemplary 3D microvascular corrosion castings.\nAll bisphosphonates induced a statistically significant decrease of MVD (p each <0.001), whereby the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) demonstrated a clearly stronger effect than non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NN-BP) clodronate (control 166, clodronate 99, ibandronate 48, pamidronate 47, zoledronate 35 microvessels/mm(2)). Referring to MVA, similar results could be detected. MVS was significantly increased especially by ibandronate (103 %) compared to control group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Scanning electron microscope scans of the corrosion castings confirmed these results.\nThe stronger influence on MVD by N-BPs compared to the NN-BP clodronate may explain for the lack of BP-ONJ after treatment with NN-BPs.\nIbandronate induced a strong increase of MVS. In combination with the reduced MVD, this could result only in a fractional reduced perfusion which might be an explanation for the lower occurrence of BP-ONJ in patients receiving ibandronate compared to patients receiving pamidronate or zoledronate.", "journal": "Clinical oral investigations", "date": "2013-07-31", "authors": ["A MPabst", "TZiebart", "MAckermann", "M AKonerding", "CWalter"], "doi": "10.1007/s00784-013-1060-x"}

To induce sufficient protein expression, a reverse microemulsion process was adopted to load pDNA into calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CP-pDNA), which were electrospun into fibers to achieve a sustained release for 4 weeks. Compared with pDNA-infiltrated fibers, the localized and gradual release of pDNA facilitated cell proliferation, gene transfection, and extracellular matrix secretion and enhanced the generation of blood vessels after subcutaneous implantation. Compared with commonly used pDNA polyplexes with poly(ethyleneimine), CP-pDNA nanoparticles induced significantly lower cytotoxicity and less inflammation reaction after implantation into animals. Fibers with encapsulated nanoparticles containing plasmids encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (pVEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factors (pbFGF) led to significantly higher density of mature blood vessels than those containing individual plasmid.

The mechanisms, though, are not well understood, results have been variable, sometimes transient in the long term, and often without a mechanistic explanation. There are still several major hurdles to be taken. Stem cell-derived cardiac cells should resemble original cardiac cell types and be able to integrate in the damaged heart. Integration requires administration of stem cell-derived cardiac cells at the right time using the right mode of delivery.

Background Altered plantar fascia vascularity and thickening of the fascia have been identified in individuals with chronic plantar fasciitis.\nThirty-eight patients with chronic unilateral plantar fasciitis and 21 controls participated in this study. Proximal plantar fascia vascularization and thickness were assessed using ultrasound imaging, and pain and foot dysfunction were quantified with a visual analog scale and the Chinese version of the Foot Function Index, respectively. Paired t tests were used to assess the side-to-side differences in fascia thickness and vascularity index (VI) in the control and patient groups, and an unpaired t test was used to make comparisons with the patient group. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify whether the VI and fascia thickness were associated with pain and foot dysfunction.\nThere were significantly higher VI (mean \u00b1 SD, 2.4% \u00b1 1.4%) and fascia thickness (5.0 \u00b1 1.3 mm) values in the affected feet when compared with the unaffected feet in the patient group (VI, 1.4% \u00b1 0.5%; fascia thickness, 3.3 \u00b1 0.7 mm) and with the dominant side of the controls (VI, 1.6% \u00b1 0.4%; fascia thickness, 2.9 \u00b1 0.6 mm).

The general conditions of an OIR term animal, both at the time of birth and following birth, differ from those of the preterm infant. This, to simulate preterm conditions and to provide a basis for further studies on ROP, we investigated the effect(s) of preterm birth on retinal vascularization using the neonatal rat.\nSprague-Dawley (SD) rats were delivered preterm by caesarean section on the day 19 of gestation. Term pups were used as controls. On the day of birth, preterm and term pups were housed under conditions of room air or cyclic oxygen. Retinas of pups housed in room air on days 4, 7, 10, 14, 18 and 22, as well as pups housed in oxygen on days 14, 18, and 22 were whole-mounted and stained with isolectin-B4.

Nonetheless, uncertainty often arises in clinical practice about the findings to be sought and the strategy for work-up.\nSelective literature review and evaluation of our own series of patients.\nPulsatile tinnitus can have many causes. No prospective studies on this subject are available to date. Pulsatile tinnitus requires both a functional organ of hearing and a genuine, physical source of sound, which can, under certain conditions, even be objectified by an examiner. Pulsatile tinnitus can be classified by its site of generation as arterial, arteriovenous, or venous. Typical arterial causes are arteriosclerosis, dissection, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Common causes at the arteriovenous junction include arteriovenous fistulae and highly vascularized skull base tumors. Common venous causes are intracranial hypertension and, as predisposing factors, anomalies and normal variants of the basal veins and sinuses. In our own series of patients, pulsatile tinnitus was most often due to highly vascularized tumors of the temporal bone (16%), followed by venous normal variants and anomalies (14%) and vascular stenoses (9%). Dural arteriovenous fistulae, inflammatory hyperemia, and intracranial hypertension were tied for fourth place (8% each).\nThe clinical findings and imaging studies must always be evaluated together.

{"title": "Vascular endothelial growth factor-a and islet vascularization are necessary in developing, but not adult, pancreatic islets.", "abstract": "Pancreatic islets are highly vascularized mini-organs, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a critical factor in the development of islet vascularization. To investigate the role of VEGF-A and endothelial cells (ECs) in adult islets, we used complementary genetic approaches to temporally inactivate VEGF-A in developing mouse pancreatic and islet progenitor cells or in adult \u03b2-cells. Inactivation of VEGF-A early in development dramatically reduced pancreatic and islet vascularization, leading to reduced \u03b2-cell proliferation in both developing and adult islets and, ultimately, reduced \u03b2-cell mass and impaired glucose clearance. When VEGF-A was inactivated in adult \u03b2-cells, islet vascularization was reduced twofold. Surprisingly, even after 3 months of reduced islet vascularization, islet architecture and \u03b2-cell gene expression, mass, and function were preserved with only a minimal abnormality in glucose clearance. These data show that normal pancreatic VEGF-A expression is critical for the recruitment of ECs and the subsequent stimulation of endocrine cell proliferation during islet development. In contrast, although VEGF-A is required for maintaining the specialized vasculature observed in normal adult islets, adult \u03b2-cells can adapt and survive long-term reductions in islet vascularity. These results indicate that VEGF-A and islet vascularization have a lesser role in adult islet function and \u03b2-cell mass.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2013-07-26", "authors": ["Rachel BReinert", "MarcelaBrissova", "AlenaShostak", "Fong ChengPan", "GregPoffenberger", "QingCai", "Gregory LHundemer", "JeannelleKantz", "Courtney SThompson", "ChunhuaDai", "Owen PMcGuinness", "Alvin CPowers"], "doi": "10.2337/db13-0071"}

In this study, we have identified a novel strategy to enhance cardiac differentiation of human iPS cells by treating embryoid bodies (EBs) with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), together with activin A and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Over a narrow window of concentrations, TSA (1 ng/ml) directed the differentiation of human iPS cells into a cardiomyocyte lineage. TSA also exerted an additive effect with activin A (100 ng/ml) and BMP4 (20 ng/ml). The resulting cardiomyocytes expressed several cardiac-specific transcription factors and contractile proteins at both gene and protein levels. Functionally, the contractile EBs displayed calcium cycling and were responsive to the chronotropic agents isoprenaline (0.1 \u03bcM) and carbachol (1 \u03bcM). Implanting microdissected beating areas of iPS cells into tissue engineering chambers in immunocompromised rats produced engineered constructs that supported their survival, and they maintained spontaneous contraction. Human cardiomyocytes were identified as compact patches of muscle tissue incorporated within a host fibrocellular stroma and were vascularized by host neovessels. In conclusion, human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes can be used to engineer functional cardiac muscle tissue for studying the pathophysiology of cardiac disease, for drug discovery test beds, and potentially for generation of cardiac grafts to surgically replace damaged myocardium.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2013-07-26", "authors": ["Shiang YLim", "PriyadharshiniSivakumaran", "Duncan ECrombie", "Gregory JDusting", "AliceP\u00e9bay", "Rodney JDilley"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2012-0161"}

Therefore we investigated this in CIDP.\nEleven patients with CIDP fulfilling the international criteria on CIDP underwent ultrasonographic examination of the median, ulnar, fibular and posterior tibial nerves and sometimes the brachial plexus bilaterally, using a standardized protocol. We assessed presence of nerve thickening and increased nerve vascularization.\nIn 7 of the 11 patients multiple nerve enlargements were detected: ulnar nerve 7, fibular nerve 5, posterior tibial nerve 4 and median nerve in 4 patients. The number of enlarged nerves was related with the MRC sum-score (p=0.03) and the total protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at diagnosis (p=0.02). Increased vascularization was seen in 6 of the 11 patients: 4 in one nerve and in 2 in multiple nerves. The number of nerves with increased vascularization was associated with the number of enlarged nerves (p=0.01) and total protein in the CSF (p=0.006).\nMultiple nerve enlargements occur in CIDP showing a relation with a lower MRC sum-score, increased nerve vascularization and a higher total protein of the CSF.\nOur findings of nerve enlargement and increased nerve vascularization may be tools to monitor disease activity in CIDP, but further studies are needed.", "journal": "Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "date": "2013-07-25", "authors": ["H SGoedee", "G J FBrekelmans", "L HVisser"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2013.05.025"}
{"title": "Sunitinib enhances neuronal survival in vitro via NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis is tightly linked to inflammation and cancer. Regulation of angiogenesis is mediated primarily through activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, thus kinase inhibitors represent a new paradigm in anti-cancer therapy. However, these inhibitors have broad effects on inflammatory processes and multiple cell types. Sunitinib is a multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has shown promise for the treatment of glioblastoma, a highly vascularized tumor. However, there is little information as to the direct effects of sunitinib on brain-derived neurons. The objective of this study is to explore the effects of sunitinib on neuronal survival as well as on the expression of inflammatory protein mediators in primary cerebral neuronal cultures.\nPrimary cortical neurons were exposed to various doses of sunitinib. The drug-treated cultures were assessed for survival by MTT assay and cell death by lactate dehydrogenase release. The ability of sunitinib to affect NF-\u03baB, COX2 and NOS2 expression was determined by western blot. The NF-\u03baB inhibitors dicoumarol, SN50 and BAY11-7085 were employed to assess the role of NF-\u03baB in sunitinib-mediated effects on neuronal survival as well as COX2 and NOS2 expression.\nTreatment of neuronal cultures with sunitinib caused a dose-dependent increase in cell survival and decrease in neuronal cell death. Exposure of neurons to sunitinib also induced an increase in the expression of NF-\u03baB, COX2 and NOS2. Inhibiting NF-\u03baB blunted the increase in cell survival and decrease in cell death evoked by sunitinib. Treatment of cell cultures with both sunitinib and NF-\u03baB inhibitors mitigated the increase in COX2 and NOS2 caused by sunitinib.\nSunitinib increases neuronal survival and this neurotrophic effect is mediated by NF-\u03baB. Also, the inflammatory proteins COX2 and NOS2 are upregulated by sunitinib in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. These data are in agreement with a growing literature suggesting beneficial effects for inflammatory mediators such as NF-\u03baB, COX2 and NOS2 in neurons. Further work is needed to fully explore the effects of sunitinib in the brain and its possible use as a treatment for glioblastoma. Finally, sunitinib may be useful for the treatment of a range of central nervous system diseases where neuronal injury is prominent.", "journal": "Journal of neuroinflammation", "date": "2013-07-25", "authors": ["AlmaSanchez", "DebjaniTripathy", "XianglingYin", "JinhuaLuo", "Joseph MMartinez", "PaulaGrammas"], "doi": "10.1186/1742-2094-10-93\n10.1007/978-1-59745-447-6_8\n10.1056/NEJM197111182852108\n10.1053/j.seminoncol.2006.04.005\n10.1517/14656566.8.14.2359\n10.1038/nrd2380\n10.1371/journal.pone.0044372\n10.1182/blood-2003-12-4266\n10.1073/pnas.0501758102\n10.1073/pnas.0810246105\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4709\n10.1371/journal.pone.0056586\n10.1007/s00210-013-0861-4\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.09.039\n10.1254/jphs.12158FP\n10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2010.07.231\n10.1002/jnr.1119\n10.1016/j.bcp.2009.12.021\n10.1172/JCI11916\n10.1016/j.neulet.2004.09.074\n10.1016/j.neulet.2006.12.029\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.019\n10.1074/jbc.274.13.8531\n10.1073/pnas.96.16.9409\n10.1007/s11064-005-6961-x\n10.1186/1471-2199-3-16\n10.1007/s12975-009-0006-8\n10.1016/j.neulet.2007.09.056\n10.1074/jbc.270.24.14255\n10.1074/jbc.272.34.21096\n10.1093/abbs/36.3.235\n10.1089/ars.2005.7.395\n10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.00973.x\n10.1227/01.NEU.0000154060.14900.8F\n10.1073/pnas.95.18.10954\n10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00537-0\n10.1096/fj.06-5957fje\n10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02643.x\n10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02870.x\n10.1016/S0304-3940(02)00095-2\n10.1006/exnr.1996.6373\n10.1113/jphysiol.2011.221317\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5066-07.2008\n10.1074/jbc.M111.338095\n10.1111/jnc.12028\n10.1002/jnr.23154\n10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10074-6\n10.1215/15228517-2007-024"}

Animals were imaged pre- and postoperatively using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography. Images were collected using an NIR imaging system. Co-localization was achieved through use of an acrylic paint/hydrogen peroxide mixture. In all transplants, ICG first crossed graft suture lines on postoperative day (POD) 5. Clinical signs of rejection also appeared on POD 5 in allogeneic transplants, with most exhibiting Grade 3 rejection by POD 6. Injection of an acrylic paint/hydrogen peroxide mixture on POD 5 confirmed the existence of continuous lymphatic vessels crossing the suture line and draining into the inguinal lymph node. NIR lymphography is a minimally invasive imaging modality that can be used to study lymphatic vessels in a rat VCA model.

TME as an intricate milieu also consists of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that can resist against chemotherapies. In solid tumors, metabolism and vascularization appears to be aberrant and tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) functions as physiologic barrier. Thus, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and gene therapy often fail to provide cogent clinical outcomes. It looms that it is the time to accept the fact that initiation of cancer could be generation of another form of life that involves a cluster of thousands of genes, while we have failed to observe all aspects of it.

Two hundred and fifty-two patients with known PTC were examined for preoperative evaluation with conventional US and BFI. Only 83 with at least one metastatic LN were included. All patients included underwent surgery; the final diagnosis was based on the results of histology. The following LN characteristics were evaluated: shape, abnormal echogenicity, absent hilum, calcifications, cystic appearance, peripheral vascularization, and BFI-TS. A total of 604 LNs were analyzed. Of these, 298 were metastatic, according to histopathology. The BFI-TS showed high values of specificity (99.7%) and sensitivity (80.9%).

Therefore, we wanted to investigate direct effects of DPO on the liver tumor cell lines HepG2, SkHep1, Huh-7, AKN1, HCC-T and HCC-M, as well as on primary human hepatocytes (hHeps). DPO (0-40\u00a0ng/ml) did not affect viability of hHeps, HepG2, SkHep1, AKN1, HCC-T and HCC-M cells, as determined by Resazurin conversion. However, Huh-7 cells' viability dose-dependently decreased from 5\u00a0ng/ml DPO on. Lack of LDH release into culture medium and negative DNA laddering excluded apoptosis or necrosis as the cause for the reduced Resazurin conversion. In Huh-7 cells, DPO increased the expression of p53. Interestingly, Huh-7 cells showed the highest basal TGF-\u03b21 expression as compared to the other cell lines. Upon inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 signaling, DPO no longer reduced viability in Huh-7 cells. On the contrary, co-incubation with TGF-\u03b21 made the other cell lines responsive to DPO. Summarizing our data, we show that DPO reduces the growth of Huh-7 cells by up-regulation of the tumor-suppressor gene p53. This mechanism seems to be dependent on a strong TGF-\u03b2 expression and corresponding signaling in these cells, as other cell lines became responsive to DPO with TGF-\u03b21 supplementation.

In this study, we analyzed whether pseudoislets composed of islet cells and bone marrow cells can improve vascularization and function of islet transplants. Pancreatic islets isolated from Syrian golden hamsters were dispersed into single cells for the generation of pseudoislets containing 4\u00d710(3) cells. To create bone marrow cell-enriched pseudoislets 2\u00d710(3) islet cells were co-cultured with 2\u00d710(3) bone marrow cells. Pseudoislets and bone marrow cell-enriched pseudoislets were transplanted syngeneically into skinfold chambers to study graft vascularization by intravital fluorescence microscopy. Native islet transplants served as controls. Bone marrow cell-enriched pseudoislets showed a significantly improved vascularization compared to native islets and pseudoislets. Moreover, bone marrow cell-enriched pseudoislets but not pseudoislets normalized blood glucose levels after transplantation of 1000 islet equivalents under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals, although the bone marrow cell-enriched pseudoislets contained only 50% of islet cells compared to pseudoislets and native islets. Fluorescence microscopy of bone marrow cell-enriched pseudoislets composed of bone marrow cells from GFP-expressing mice showed a distinct fraction of cells expressing both GFP and insulin, indicating a differentiation of bone marrow-derived cells to an insulin-producing cell-type. Thus, enrichment of pseudoislets by bone marrow cells enhances vascularization after transplantation and increases the amount of insulin-producing tissue.

{"title": "Heparinized collagen scaffolds with and without growth factors for the repair of diaphragmatic hernia: construction and in vivo evaluation.", "abstract": "A regenerative medicine approach to restore the morphology and function of the diaphragm in congenital diaphragmatic hernia is especially challenging because of the position and flat nature of this organ, allowing cell ingrowth primarily from the perimeter. Use of porous collagen scaffolds for the closure of surgically created diaphragmatic defects in rats has been shown feasible, but better ingrowth of cells, specifically blood vessels and muscle cells, is warranted. To stimulate this process, heparin, a glycosaminoglycan involved in growth factor binding, was covalently bound to porous collagenous scaffolds (14%), with or without vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 0.4 \u00b5g/mg scaffold), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 0.5 \u00b5g/mg scaffold) or a combination of VEGF + HGF (0.2 + 0.5 \u00b5g/mg scaffold). All components were located primarily at the outside of scaffolds. Scaffolds were implanted in the diaphragm of rats and evaluated after 2 and 12 weeks. No herniations or eventrations were observed, and in several cases, growth factor-substituted scaffolds showed macroscopically visible blood vessels at the lung site.

{"title": "Key role of microRNA-15a in the KLF4 suppressions of proliferation and angiogenesis in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells.", "abstract": "While recent insights indicate that the transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is indispensable for vascular homeostasis, its exact role in proliferation and angiogenesis and how it functions remain unresolved. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of KLF4 in the proliferations of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as the angiogenesis. The overexpression of KLF4 in endothelial cells significantly impaired tube formation. KLF4 inhibited the formation of a vascular network in implanted Matrigel plugs in nude mice. Importantly, we found that KLF4 significantly upregulated the miR-15a expression in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, and conversely, KLF4 depletion reduced the amount of miR-15a. Furthermore, KLF4 blocked cell cycle progression and decreased cyclin D1 expression in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells through the induction of miR-15a. Intriguingly, the delivery of a miR-15a antagomir to nude mice resulted in marked attenuation of the anti-angiogenic effect of KLF4. Collectively, our present study provide the first evidence that miR-15a as a direct transcriptional target of KLF4 that mediates the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic actions of KLF4, which indicates that KLF4 upregulation of miR-15a may represent a therapeutic option to suppress proliferative vascular disorders.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["XuemeiZheng", "AiqinLi", "LiangZhao", "TengfeiZhou", "QiangShen", "QinghuaCui", "XiaomeiQin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.07.017"}
{"title": "Macrophages regulate corpus luteum development during embryo implantation in mice.", "abstract": "Macrophages are prominent in the uterus and ovary at conception. Here we utilize the Cd11b-Dtr mouse model of acute macrophage depletion to define the essential role of macrophages in early pregnancy. Macrophage depletion after conception caused embryo implantation arrest associated with diminished plasma progesterone and poor uterine receptivity. Implantation failure was alleviated by administration of bone marrow-derived CD11b+F4/80+ monocytes/macrophages. In the ovaries of macrophage-depleted mice, corpora lutea were profoundly abnormal, with elevated Ptgs2, Hif1a, and other inflammation and apoptosis genes and with diminished expression of steroidogenesis genes Star, Cyp11a1, and Hsd3b1. Infertility was rescued by exogenous progesterone, which confirmed that uterine refractoriness was fully attributable to the underlying luteal defect. In normally developing corpora lutea, macrophages were intimately juxtaposed with endothelial cells and expressed the proangiogenic marker TIE2. After macrophage depletion, substantial disruption of the luteal microvascular network occurred and was associated with altered ovarian expression of genes that encode vascular endothelial growth factors. These data indicate a critical role for macrophages in supporting the extensive vascular network required for corpus luteum integrity and production of progesterone essential for establishing pregnancy. Our findings raise the prospect that disruption of macrophage-endothelial cell interactions underpinning corpus luteum development contributes to infertility in women in whom luteal insufficiency is implicated.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2013-07-23", "authors": ["Alison SCare", "Kerrilyn RDiener", "Melinda JJasper", "Hannah MBrown", "Wendy VIngman", "Sarah ARobertson"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI60561\n10.1002/eji.200737638\n10.1189/jlb.1105656\n10.1038/nri2528\n10.1016/S0165-0378(96)88352-5\n10.1677/joe.0.1260417\n10.1095/biolreprod.110.085399\n10.1111/j.1600-0897.2006.00446.x\n10.1093/humupd/dmh011\n10.1095/biolreprod48.2.277\n10.1095/biolreprod62.4.1059\n10.1530/REP-10-0327\n10.1095/biolreprod56.1.110\n10.1095/biolreprod50.5.1161\n10.1095/biolreprod25.3.629\n10.1210/en.130.2.954\n10.1073/pnas.87.12.4828\n10.1016/0012-1606(91)90336-2\n10.1210/en.143.4.1413\n10.1095/biolreprod58.6.1469\n10.1016/S0143-4004(98)80009-X\n10.1172/JCI22675\n10.1530/reprod/120.2.423\n10.1210/er.2006-0022\n10.1210/en.139.8.3597\n10.1095/biolreprod.102.010819\n10.1074/jbc.M006016200\n10.1182/blood-2009-01-200931\n10.1210/er.18.1.4\n10.1095/biolreprod.112.099960\n10.1101/gad.9.18.2266\n10.1016/j.it.2007.09.004\n10.1172/JCI58832\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422758\n10.1071/RD12096\n10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.036\n10.1172/JCI20465\n10.1210/endo-127-2-965\n10.1210/jc.85.11.4302\n10.1210/jc.86.7.3377\n10.1530/rep.1.01064\n10.4049/jimmunol.0902501\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64255-1\n10.1073/pnas.95.2.548\n10.1093/emboj/16.13.3898\n10.1073/pnas.95.24.14389\n10.1161/01.RES.0000073584.46059.E3\n10.1038/ncb2331\n10.1038/nature04480\n10.1126/science.6823562\n10.1172/JCI20645\n10.1095/biolreprod63.6.1905\n10.1095/biolreprod56.1.186\n10.1210/me.9.11.1431\n10.1530/reprod/120.2.239\n10.1095/biolreprod62.3.704\n10.1210/en.2005-1189\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)61209-6\n10.2353/ajpath.2009.090248\n10.1242/dev.059261\n10.1210/jc.81.2.565\n10.1093/humrep/17.9.2287\n10.1136/bmj.d1914\n10.1097/MOL.0b013e32834a77b4\n10.1172/JCI29881\n10.1016/j.steroids.2003.08.010\n10.1093/intimm/4.9.1021"}

{"title": "Neonatal human dermal fibroblasts immobilized in RGD-alginate induce angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Promoting angiogenesis in a damaged tissue is a major challenge for tissue regeneration. Recent findings in tissue engineering suggest that fibroblasts (FBs) play an important role in orchestrating the angiogenic process. Fibroblasts maintain the structural integrity of connective tissue by continuously secreting growth factors and extracellular matrix precursors, which are essential for endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and spreading, thus playing a crucial role in angiogenesis. We hypothesized that FBs immobilized in alginate gels grafted with the RGD peptidic sequence could influence the recruitment of ECs to improve vascularization. In this work, the modulation of immobilized human FBs within the 3D synthetic extracellular matrix was assessed. Experiments using cocultures of ECs and FBs in indirect contact as well as angiogenic assays were performed to assess the influence of FBs immobilized in RGD-alginate in ECs' viability, stabilization, sprouting, and assembly into capillary-like structures. This study demonstrates the ability of FBs immobilized within RGD-alginate microspheres to modulate and support capillary-like structures' assembly. These findings indicate that the microenvironment created by these stromal cells in the scaffold modulates capillary morphogenesis, thus stimulating angiogenesis in situ and can potentially be used in regenerative medicine in clinical scenarios where vascularization is essential.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2013-07-20", "authors": ["Susana GGuerreiro", "Maria JOliveira", "M\u00e1rio ABarbosa", "RaquelSoares", "Pedro LGranja"], "doi": "10.3727/096368913X670183"}

For this aim, gelatin was firstly electrospun and then cross-linked at two different concentrations (0.1% and 0.5% w/v) by using genipin, a low toxic agent, in order to fabricate a suitable substrate to be loaded with VEGF. Collected fibers were homogeneous and free of beads, the fibrous structure was retained after cross-linking. Mechanical properties were deeply affected by the chemical treatment showing a different behavior, depending on the testing conditions (i.e., dry or wet state). VEGF release was assessed by means of ELISA assay: a cumulative release of about 90% (0.1% w/v) and 60% (0.5% w/v) at 28 days was measured. Both VEGF loaded mats induced cell viability, endothelial differentiation and showed chemoattractive properties when tested on human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). In vitro and in vivo angiogenic assays demonstrated that the VEGF loaded mats induced an angiogenic potential in stimulating new vessel formation similar, if not superior, to fresh VEGF. VEGF retains bioactive and pro-angiogenic potential for up to 14 days. The results demonstrated that genipin cross-linked electrospun gelatin mats loaded with VEGF could be part of a useful strategy to stimulate and induce angiogenesis in tissue engineered applications.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2013-07-19", "authors": ["CostantinoDel Gaudio", "SilviaBaiguera", "MargheritaBoieri", "BenedettaMazzanti", "DomenicoRibatti", "AlessandraBianco", "PaoloMacchiarini"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.06.040"}
{"title": "Generation of functionally competent and durable engineered blood vessels from human induced pluripotent stem cells.", "abstract": "Efficient generation of competent vasculogenic cells is a critical challenge of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell-based regenerative medicine. Biologically relevant systems to assess functionality of the engineered vessels in vivo are equally important for such development. Here, we report a unique approach for the derivation of endothelial precursor cells from hiPS cells using a triple combination of selection markers--CD34, neuropilin 1, and human kinase insert domain-containing receptor--and an efficient 2D culture system for hiPS cell-derived endothelial precursor cell expansion. With these methods, we successfully generated endothelial cells (ECs) from hiPS cells obtained from healthy donors and formed stable functional blood vessels in vivo, lasting for 280 d in mice. In addition, we developed an approach to generate mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) from hiPS cells in parallel. Moreover, we successfully generated functional blood vessels in vivo using these ECs and MPCs derived from the same hiPS cell line. These data provide proof of the principle that autologous hiPS cell-derived vascular precursors can be used for in vivo applications, once safety and immunological issues of hiPS-based cellular therapy have been resolved. Additionally, the durability of hiPS-derived blood vessels in vivo demonstrates a potential translation of this approach in long-term vascularization for tissue engineering and treatment of vascular diseases. Of note, we have also successfully generated ECs and MPCs from type 1 diabetic patient-derived hiPS cell lines and use them to generate blood vessels in vivo, which is an important milestone toward clinical translation of this approach.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2013-07-19", "authors": ["RekhaSamuel", "LaurenceDaheron", "ShanLiao", "TruptiVardam", "Walid SKamoun", "AnaBatista", "ChristaBuecker", "RichardSch\u00e4fer", "XiaoxingHan", "PatrickAu", "David TScadden", "Dan GDuda", "DaiFukumura", "Rakesh KJain"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1310675110"}

{"title": "Atypical femoral fractures.", "abstract": "Bisphosphonates (BPs) represent the most widely used therapy for osteoporosis. Recently, a relationship between long-term treatment with BPs and a subset of atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) from below the lesser trochanter to the sovracondilar line has been described. Many etiopathogenetic theories have been invoked to explain AFFs: reduced bone turnover and increased osteoblast bone apposition with accumulation of microdamage and decreased bone toughness with subsequent increased risk of micro-cracks and duration fractures, collagen fiber cross-linking and vascularization impairment. Based on published studies, a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research has redacted the diagnostic criteria of AFFs by classifying them according to their major and minor criteria. The treatment for displaced AFFs is osteosynthesis, but there is a lack of evidence for undisplaced AFFs and the duration of fracture treatment. BPs have a proven efficacy in osteoporotic fracture reduction as well as in the treatment of other bone diseases caused by the downregulation of osteoclast activity.

About fifty percent of high risk patients die despite treatment making the exploration of new and more effective strategies for improving stratification mandatory. Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension occurring in poorly vascularized areas of the tumor associated with poor prognosis. We had previously defined a robust gene expression signature measuring the hypoxic component of neuroblastoma tumors (NB-hypo) which is a molecular risk factor. We wanted to develop a prognostic classifier of neuroblastoma patients' outcome blending existing knowledge on clinical and molecular risk factors with the prognostic NB-hypo signature. Furthermore, we were interested in classifiers outputting explicit rules that could be easily translated into the clinical setting.\nShadow Clustering (SC) technique, which leads to final models called Logic Learning Machine (LLM), exhibits a good accuracy and promises to fulfill the aims of the work. We utilized this algorithm to classify NB-patients on the bases of the following risk factors: Age at diagnosis, INSS stage, MYCN amplification and NB-hypo. The algorithm generated explicit classification rules in good agreement with existing clinical knowledge. Through an iterative procedure we identified and removed from the dataset those examples which caused instability in the rules. This workflow generated a stable classifier very accurate in predicting good and poor outcome patients. The good performance of the classifier was validated in an independent dataset. NB-hypo was an important component of the rules with a strength similar to that of tumor staging.\nThe novelty of our work is to identify stability, explicit rules and blending of molecular and clinical risk factors as the key features to generate classification rules for NB patients to be conveyed to the clinic and to be used to design new therapies.

{"title": "Transdifferentiation of fast skeletal muscle into functional endothelium in vivo by transcription factor Etv2.", "abstract": "Etsrp/Etv2 (Etv2) is an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of vascular development in vertebrates. Etv2 deficiency prevents the proper specification of the endothelial cell lineage, while its overexpression causes expansion of the endothelial cell lineage in the early embryo or in embryonic stem cells. We hypothesized that Etv2 alone is capable of transdifferentiating later somatic cells into endothelial cells. Using heat shock inducible Etv2 transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that Etv2 expression alone is sufficient to transdifferentiate fast skeletal muscle cells into functional blood vessels. Following heat treatment, fast skeletal muscle cells turn on vascular genes and repress muscle genes. Time-lapse imaging clearly shows that muscle cells turn on vascular gene expression, undergo dramatic morphological changes, and integrate into the existing vascular network. Lineage tracing and immunostaining confirm that fast skeletal muscle cells are the source of these newly generated vessels. Microangiography and observed blood flow demonstrated that this new vasculature is capable of supporting circulation. Using pharmacological, transgenic, and morpholino approaches, we further establish that the canonical Wnt pathway is important for induction of the transdifferentiation process, whereas the VEGF pathway provides a maturation signal for the endothelial fate. Additionally, overexpression of Etv2 in mammalian myoblast cells, but not in other cell types examined, induced expression of vascular genes. We have demonstrated in zebrafish that expression of Etv2 alone is sufficient to transdifferentiate fast skeletal muscle into functional endothelial cells in vivo.

{"title": "The reconstruction of the spheno-orbital region using latissimus dorsi flap and costal graft.", "abstract": "To minimize complications in skull base surgery, it is necessary to separate intracranial structures from the upper aerodigestive tract with well-vascularized tissue. The majority of defects can be reconstructed using local flaps using pericranium, galea, or temporalis muscle. However, there are conditions that affect the suitability of the previously mentioned flaps, for example, previous surgical procedures or radiotherapy. Local flaps may also be inadequate to reconstruct particularly large defects. Extensive bony demolitions produce aesthetic deformities that need accurate reconstructions. Orbital wall defects have to be reconstructed to avoid complications such as the transmission of cerebral pulsation, bulbar dystopias, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. The microvascular latissimus dorsi flap is ideal in all these cases, and the use of a costal graft allows simultaneous reconstruction of bony defects. From January 2000 to January 2008, 17 patients have undergone surgical ablation of the spheno-orbital region and reconstruction with latissimus dorsi flap and costal grafts. The flap survival rate was 100%. One patient required revision of the venous anastomosis. No cerebrospinal fluid leak or intracranial infections have been detected. The only complications registered were dystopias in 6 patients and diplopia in 4; all of these spontaneously resolved within 2 months. The microvascular latissimus dorsi flap with costal graft is an effective method for the reconstruction of the spheno-orbital region when local flaps are not indicated. It has a negligible donor-site morbidity, an ideal vascular pedicle, and an easy harvesting technique.

In this clinical pilot study, we report a novel method for reconstruction of mandibular continuity defect by in vivo tissue engineering. In 3 patients with critical-size mandibular bone defects, the allogenic mandibular bone scaffold was customized, loaded by ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells, and transplanted into the surgical defect site. According to the bone scintigraphy, vascularized bone was identified in 2 cases. In spiral computed tomography, normal bone healing without significant bone resorption was seen at the 2 viable grafts, but at the failed construction, there was a lack of osteointegration to the adjacent host bone and a higher density in the medullary bone. According to the serial panoramic imaging, the patients with viable bone grafts had normal bone healing, whereas the other patient had progressive overall bone resorption. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of allogenic bone scaffold loaded by mesenchymal stem cells in the reconstruction of mandibular continuity defects. Although long-term results are not yet available, it may be a novel method of reconstruction and a basis for further studies.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["BarbadZamiri", "ShoalehShahidi", "Mohamadreza BaghabanEslaminejad", "AhadKhoshzaban", "MehdiGholami", "EmadBahramnejad", "RezaMoghadasali", "SouraMardpour", "NasserAghdami"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e318294288a"}

In this study, we investigate the local immunomodulatory properties of soluble CD83 (sCD83) at the graft-host interface using the high-risk corneal transplantation model. In this model, which mimics the inflammatory status and the preexisting vascularization of high-risk patients undergoing corneal transplantation, allogeneic donor corneas are transplanted onto sCD83-treated recipient animals. This model allows the direct and precise application of the immune modulator at the transplantation side. Interestingly, sCD83 was able to prolong graft survival after systemic application as well as after topical application, which is therapeutically more relevant. The therapeutic effect was accompanied by an increase in the frequency of regulatory T cells and was mediated by the immune-regulatory enzyme IDO and TGF-\u03b2. In vitro, sCD83 induced long-term IDO expression in both conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells via autocrine or paracrine production of TGF-\u03b2, a cytokine previously shown to be an essential mediator of IDO-dependent, long-term tolerance.

{"title": "Role of vascular endothelial progenitor cells in construction of new vascular loop.", "abstract": "Since bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been detected in adult peripheral blood, the mode of vasculogenesis in the adult tissue has caught attention in field of vascularization research. To confirm the role of EPCs in construction of new vascular loop, we took the biomaterial scaffold implanted into adult rat as an experimental model to observe and examine the actions of the EPCs in neovascularization of the material by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, by establishing a chemotactic migration model for vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and EPCs, the migrations of ECs and EPCs were explored in simulations. The results of 20,000 simulations showed that the number of the vascular loops assisted by the EPCs was 2-5 times that of the vascular sprouts being naturally joined. Based on the results of experiments and simulations, we conclude that the EPCs are able to assist the angiogenic sprouts in joining under the condition of plenty of the EPCs being mobilized, which aggregate at sites close to sprout tips, forming a cell cord and differentiating to ECs in situ, and become vessel segments between neighboring sprouts. This suggests that there is a difference between the adult and embryo in the manner of vasculogenesis and that a small number of EPCs can play an important role to make the new blood vessels achieve rapid functionalization.", "journal": "Microvascular research", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["KuihuaZhan", "LunBai", "JianmeiXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mvr.2013.06.010"}

Lymph leaks remain a common cause of morbidity in patients who have undergone groin dissection. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence for prevention and treatment of lymphatic fistulas after arterial surgery in the groin.\nA systematic review of the English language literature was undertaken to determine the success of the various treatment options described.\nA comprehensive literature search identified 46 studies describing several treatment options for lymphatic fistulas. A qualitative synthesis of these studies was performed. There was no consensus definition of lymphatic fistula. Treatments reviewed were: conservative management; lymphatic ligation; vascularized muscle flaps; and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Due to poor study quality and the paucity of data no one treatment could be identified as superior.\nThere was no quantifiable cut-off for either the amount of lymphatic output or number of days postoperatively that leakage continued to help determine when conservative measures should be abandoned and surgical intervention undertaken. There is some evidence supporting use of vascularized muscle flaps to reduce the volume of lymphatic drainage and help prevent secondary graft infection. The use of NPWT is also promising, but must be weighed against the associated risk of anastomotic bleeding and requirement for additional inpatient stay.", "journal": "Annals of vascular surgery", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["Christopher PTwine", "Ian FLane", "Ian MWilliams"], "doi": "10.1016/j.avsg.2013.01.003"}
{"title": "Evaluation of reconstructive techniques for anterior and middle skull base defects following tumor ablation.", "abstract": "Reconstruction after resection of head and neck cancer can be challenging, especially when tumors extend to the base of the skull. Vascularized flaps are the option of choice, whether free or pedicled. Free flaps have the added benefit of access to the more cephalad defects of the anterior cranial base without the constraints of the rotation arc of pedicled flaps. The authors compared various flaps used for the reconstruction of defects of the anterior or middle skull base after resection of malignant tumors.\nThe authors identified 12 patients in whom 14 flaps were performed. All patients had malignant neoplasms extending to the anterior or middle cranial base that were reconstructed with free or pedicled flaps. A retrospective analysis was performed to compare the characteristics of patient demographics, tumor, and surgical technique. Complications among the various flaps were compared. Patients' assessments of function and quality of life were assessed by conducting a telephone survey.\nMost patients had stage 3 or 4 squamous cell carcinoma originating in the paranasal sinuses and extending to the anterior or middle skull base, requiring orbital exenteration. The flaps used included 6 radial forearm free flaps (RFFFs), 3 anterolateral thigh flaps (ALTs), 4 thoracodorsal artery perforator free flaps (TDAPs), and 1 pedicled supraclavicular flap. There were no major complications, such as perioperative heart attack, stroke, death, or meningitis. Minor complications included 3 mesh exposures after radiation treatment, 1 wound infection, and 2 flaps with wound dehiscence after radiation. These 2 dehiscences were seen with RFFFs and were later reoperated using TDAPs. There were no cerebrospinal fluid leaks or donor-site morbidity. There were no complaints of functional deficits, such as feeding difficulties or speech impairments. Some visual disturbance was reported after orbital exenteration, although this was an expected outcome.\nVascularized flaps provide reliable and durable reconstructive options for anterior and middle skull base defects after resection of large complex malignant neoplasms of the craniofacial region. Free flaps, such as RFFFs, ALTs, and TDAPs, are well suited for these defects. They have a low risk of complications and low donor-site morbidity and offer good functional and esthetic outcomes.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["Jayini SThakker", "RuiFernandes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2013.05.017"}
{"title": "Automated characterization of blood vessels as arteries and veins in retinal images.", "abstract": "In recent years researchers have found that alternations in arterial or venular tree of the retinal vasculature are associated with several public health problems such as diabetic retinopathy which is also the leading cause of blindness in the world. A prerequisite for automated assessment of subtle changes in arteries and veins, is to accurately separate those vessels from each other. This is a difficult task due to high similarity between arteries and veins in addition to variation of color and non-uniform illumination inter and intra retinal images. In this paper a novel structural and automated method is presented for artery/vein classification of blood vessels in retinal images. The proposed method consists of three main steps. In the first step, several image enhancement techniques are employed to improve the images. Then a specific feature extraction process is applied to separate major arteries from veins. Indeed, vessels are divided to smaller segments and feature extraction and vessel classification are applied to each small vessel segment instead of each vessel point. Finally, a post processing step is added to improve the results obtained from the previous step using structural characteristics of the retinal vascular network. In the last stage, vessel features at intersection and bifurcation points are processed for detection of arterial and venular sub trees. Ultimately vessel labels are revised by publishing the dominant label through each identified connected tree of arteries or veins. Evaluation of the proposed approach against two different datasets of retinal images including DRIVE database demonstrates the good performance and robustness of the method. The proposed method may be used for determination of arteriolar to venular diameter ratio in retinal images. Also the proposed method potentially allows for further investigation of labels of thinner arteries and veins which might be found by tracing them back to the major vessels.", "journal": "Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["QazalehMirsharif", "FarshadTajeripour", "HamidrezaPourreza"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compmedimag.2013.06.003"}
{"title": "Tumour-stroma interactions in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: rationale and current evidence for new therapeutic strategies.", "abstract": "Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced/metastatic disease and have a dismal prognosis. Despite the proven albeit modest benefits of gemcitabine demonstrated over a decade ago, subsequent advances have been slow, suggesting it may be time to take a different approach. It is thought that some key characteristics of pancreatic cancer, such as the desmoplasia, restricted vasculature and hypoxic environment, may prevent the delivery of chemotherapy to the tumour thereby explaining the limited benefits observed to-date. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that the stroma is not only a mechanical barrier but also constitutes a dynamic compartment of pancreatic tumours that is critically involved in tumour formation, progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting the stroma and the tumour represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Currently, several stroma-targeting agents are entering clinical development. Among these, nab-paclitaxel appears promising since it combines cytotoxic therapy with targeted delivery via its proposed ability to bind SPARC on tumour and stromal cells. Preclinical data indicate that co-treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine results in stromal depletion, increased tumour vascularization and intratumoural gemcitabine concentration, and increased tumour regression compared with either agent alone. Phase I/II study data also suggest that a high level of antitumor activity can be achieved with this combination in pancreatic cancer. This was recently confirmed in a Phase III study which showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved overall survival (HR 0.72) and progression-free survival (HR 0.69) versus gemcitabine alone for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.", "journal": "Cancer treatment reviews", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["VHeinemann", "MReni", "MYchou", "D JRichel", "TMacarulla", "MDucreux"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ctrv.2013.04.004"}

We investigated differentiation by means of histology, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. Data suggest that the guinea pig's yolk sac was not sufficiently developed to facilitate substantial fetal nutrition in early pregnancy. On Day 12, it was a flat, inverted, but avascular structure. This was followed by differentiation to form the typical, highly villous and vascularized condition of advanced gestation. Finally, the yolk sac degenerated toward term. We suggest that the guinea pig and other caviomorphs rely predominantly on hemotrophic nutrition via the placenta even in very early pregnancy. In contrast to the general pattern of mammals, histiotrophic nutrition via yolk sac routes seems to be most essential during mid-gestation.", "journal": "Theriogenology", "date": "2013-07-16", "authors": ["Bruno GomesVasconcelos", "Phelipe OliveiraFavaron", "Maria AngelicaMiglino", "Andrea MariaMess"], "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.06.007"}

Allografts may suffer from additional insults further weakening their overall benefits. Changes in local blood flow, lack of fully restored neurologic function, infection, inflammation with subsequent dysregulated regenerative activity, and paucity of appropriate growth factors may all be involved in reducing the potential of CTAs and therefore serve as new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes. Strategies involving minimized immunosuppression and pro-regenerative therapy may provide a greater path to optimizing long-term CTA function. One such strategy may include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can provide unique anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative effects.

{"title": "Regulation of Bone Marrow Angiogenesis by Osteoblasts during Bone Development and Homeostasis.", "abstract": "Bone marrow is a highly heterogeneous and vascularized tissue. The various cell types populating the bone marrow extensively communicate with each other, and cell-to-cell cross talk is likely to be essential for proper bone development and homeostasis. In particular, the existence of osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling has been recently proposed. Despite its high degree of vascularization, a gradient of oxygenation is present in the bone marrow, and the endosteal surface of cortical bone appears to be among the most hypoxic areas in the body. Oxygen (O2) is both an essential metabolic substrate and a regulatory signal that is in charge of a specific genetic program. An important component of this program is the family of transcription factors known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs).

All corneas were obtained from eye banks in the US. Indications, complications, and outcomes of surgery were recorded. This study was approved by the institutional review board.\nEighty-five consecutive eyes were included in this study. There were 52 (61.2%) males and 33 (38.8%) females. The median age was 35.0 years (range 3-85 years), and the median follow-up period was 24 months (range 6-108 months). The indications for PKP were keratoconus, bullous keratopathy, corneal scars, corneal dystrophy, and corneal regraft. The overall graft survival time was 88.9 months \u00b1 4.9 months (mean \u00b1 standard error of mean, 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.4 months -98.4 months) while the 3-year and 5-year cumulative survival rates were 90.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Surgical indication (P = 0.038), immune rejection (P < 0.001), preoperative corneal vascularization (P = 0.022), and perioperative high intraocular pressure (P = 0.032) were associated significantly with corneal graft failure in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis reduced these significant associations to rejection (P < 0.001) and vascularization (P = 0.009). Relative risk for failure in rejected cornea was 16.22 (95% CI 4.99-52.69) and in vascularized cornea was 3.89 (95% CI 1.36-11.09). At last visit following PKP, 34 (40%) eyes had best spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 51 (60.0%) eyes had 20/80 or better. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was worse than 20/400 in 15 (17.6%) eyes.\nThe overall corneal graft survival in a private setting in Saudi Arabia can be excellent.

{"title": "Lamina propria: the functional center of the bladder?", "abstract": "The bladder mucosa consists of the urothelium, basement membrane, and lamina propria (LP). Although the urothelium has been given much attention, it may be regarded as one part of a signaling system involving another equally important component of the bladder mucosa, namely, the LP. The LP lies between the basement membrane of the mucosa and the detrusor muscle and is composed of an extracellular matrix containing several types of cells, including fibroblasts, adipocytes, interstitial cells, and afferent and efferent nerve endings. In addition, the LP contains a rich vascular network, lymphatic vessels, elastic fibers, and smooth muscle fascicles (muscularis mucosae). The roles of the LP and its components in bladder function have not been definitively established, though it has been suggested to be the capacitance layer of the bladder, determining bladder compliance and enabling adaptive changes to increasing volumes. However, the bladder LP may also serve as a communication center, with an important integrative role in signal transduction to the central nervous system (nociception, mechanosensation). The LP may also, by means of its different components, make it possible for the urothelium to transmit information to other components of the bladder wall, contributing to activation of the detrusor muscle. In addition, the LP may serve as a source for production of factors influencing the growth of both the overlying urothelium and the underlying detrusor muscle.", "journal": "Neurourology and urodynamics", "date": "2013-07-13", "authors": ["Karl-ErikAndersson", "Karen DMcCloskey"], "doi": "10.1002/nau.22465"}

It does so by stimulating a sequence of well studied anti-apoptotic pro-survival mechanisms in a similar manner to various 'ischemic' pre-/post-conditioning approaches which achieve their cardio protective effects in both laboratory and clinical situations. Proliferation of newly formed blood vessels, resulting in formation of highly vascularized granulation tissue, is an essential stage of infarct healing. It can be evaluated by detecting various angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) or by quantification of expression of vascular smooth muscle progenitors, such as Nestin. Expression of these three markers was used to evaluate the effect of early isoflurane post-conditioning in ischemia-reperfusion type cardiac injury. A large reduction in infarct size (59.3% of control), and marked increase of expression of VEGF (43.4%), PECAM-1/CD31 (136%) and Nestin (77.9%) was found in experimental animals when compared to control animals that did not receive isoflurane treatment.

Revascularization of the stenotic renal artery alone does not restore renal medullary structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that addition of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) can restore stenotic-kidney medullary tubular transport function and attenuate its remodeling. Twenty-seven swine were divided into three ARAS (high-cholesterol diet and renal artery stenosis) and a normal control group. Six weeks after ARAS induction, two groups were treated with PTRA alone or PTRA supplemented with adipose-tissue-derived MSC (10 \u00d7 10(6) cells intra-renal). Multi-detector computed tomography and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI studies were performed 4 weeks later to assess kidney hemodynamics and function, and tissue collected a few days later for histology and micro-CT imaging. PTRA effectively decreased blood pressure, yet medullary vascular density remained low. Addition of MSC improved medullary vascularization in ARAS+PTRA+MSC and increased angiogenic signaling, including protein expression of vascular endothelial growth-factor, its receptor (FLK-1), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1. ARAS+PTRA+MSC also showed attenuated inflammation, although oxidative-stress remained elevated.

Therefore, adjunctive MSC delivery in addition to PTRA reduces inflammation, fibrogenesis and vascular remodeling, and restores oxygen-dependent tubular function in the stenotic-kidney medulla, although additional interventions might be required to reduce oxidative-stress.

Deletion of Bmp2 in osteoblasts also leads to defective mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which correlates with the reduced microvascular bed in the periosteum and trabecular bones. Expression of several MSC marker genes (\u03b1-SMA, CD146 and Angiopoietin-1) in vivo, in vitro CFU assays and deletion of Bmp2 in vitro in \u03b1-SMA(+) MSCs support our conclusions. Critical roles of Bmp2 in osteoblasts and MSCs are a vital link between bone formation, vascularization and mesenchymal stem cells.", "journal": "Journal of cell science", "date": "2013-07-12", "authors": ["WuchenYang", "DayongGuo", "Marie AHarris", "YongCui", "JelicaGluhak-Heinrich", "JunjieWu", "Xiao-DongChen", "CharlesSkinner", "Jeffry SNyman", "James REdwards", "Gregory RMundy", "AlexLichtler", "Barbara EKream", "David WRowe", "IvoKalajzic", "ValDavid", "Darryl LQuarles", "DemetriVillareal", "GregScott", "ManasRay", "SLiu", "James FMartin", "YujiMishina", "Stephen EHarris"], "doi": "10.1242/jcs.118596\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.07.014\n10.1016/j.bone.2010.04.606\n10.1089/ten.tea.2012.0367\n10.1371/journal.pgen.0020216\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.06.012\n10.1089/hum.2010.136\n10.1007/s00223-002-1057-y\n10.1242/dev.073197\n10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00815-3\n10.1038/nature10144\n10.1359/jbmr.070725\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.003\n10.1210/en.2009-0216\n10.1210/en.143.4.1545\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.05.001\n10.1210/en.137.1.331\n10.1006/bbrc.2001.5351\n10.1074/jbc.M205053200\n10.11613/BM.2008.008\n10.1016/j.bone.2010.02.024\n10.1002/stem.780\n10.1359/jbmr.080103\n10.1016/j.bone.2008.04.023\n10.1002/jcb.23289\n10.1387/ijdb.041816fl\n10.1172/JCI61209\n10.2106/JBJS.H.01177\n10.1038/emboj.2009.361\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.07.010\n10.1038/nrrheum.2012.36\n10.1016/j.bone.2010.02.030\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.02.017\n10.1002/tera.1420220306\n10.1002/jbmr.1691\n10.1038/nm.2252\n10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03577.x\n10.1002/jbmr.326\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.003\n10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.025\n10.1359/jbmr.090602\n10.1242/jcs.083659\n10.1016/j.cytogfr.2009.10.007\n10.1159/000143431\n10.1371/journal.pbio.0000069\n10.1074/jbc.M111.288472\n10.1038/ng1916\n10.2106/JBJS.G.01109\n10.1016/j.bone.2010.10.178\n10.1038/cr.2008.323\n10.1016/j.bone.2009.06.030\n10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00545.x\n10.1016/j.bone.2008.09.010\n10.1177/0022034511424409\n10.1073/pnas.0500031102\n10.1359/jbmr.090204\n10.1016/j.bone.2012.09.029\n10.1083/jcb.200109012"}
{"title": "Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the germinal matrix induces neurovascular proteases and intraventricular hemorrhage.", "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage in preterm neonates may result in neonatal mortality and functional disabilities, but its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly defined and better therapies are needed. We used a tetracycline-regulated transgenic system to test whether the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the germinal matrix leads to intracranial hemorrhage. This genetic strategy initially induced a dense network of loosely adjoined endothelial cells and pericytes near lateral ventricles, similar to the immature vascular rete in human fetal brains. Yet, this rich vascular network transformed into low-vasculature patches correlated with hemorrhage and caspase-3 activation near birth. Gene expression and biochemical analyses suggested that downstream mediators of VEGF in this network include transcriptional factors ETS1 and HIF2\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1), components of the PDGF\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor \u03b2) and TGF\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2) receptor signaling pathways, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and cathepsins. Prenatal administration of glucocorticoids markedly reduced mortality and cerebral hemorrhage in mutant animals, as in human neonates. This protective effect was not due to blocking vasculogenesis, but was instead associated with inhibition of neurovascular proteases, notably MMP-9, cathepsin B, and caspase-3. Collectively, these results support a causative role of VEGF in perinatal cerebral hemorrhage and implicate its downstream proteases as potential therapeutic targets.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2013-07-12", "authors": ["DianerYang", "Jessica MBaumann", "Yu-YoSun", "MianzhiTang", "Richard ScottDunn", "Ann LAkeson", "Steven GKernie", "SuhasKallapur", "Diana MLindquist", "Eric JHuang", "Stanley StevenPotter", "Hung-ChiLiang", "Chia-YiKuan"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.3005794"}

Resection of the neuroma causing the syndrome, reconstruction of the nerve gap of the median nerve, and covering up the reconstructed median nerve with well-vascularized soft tissue for prevention of CTS re-recurrence are the essential procedures. We report a case of recurrent CTS with severe pain due to a neuroma-in-continuity successfully treated using a free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap with a vascularized lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). A 2 cm neuroma existed in the median nerve and was resected. The nerve gap was repaired using a vascularized LFCN included in the ALT flap. The ALT flap was transferred to the wrist to cover the median nerve. The severe pain disappeared completely and the sensory and motor impairment of the median nerve improved 5 months after the free flap surgery, as the Tinel's sign moved distally away from the wrist and disappeared. The result of the Semmes-Weinstein test improved from 5.08 to 4.31 and she was able to flex and extend the right wrist and fingers without pain. CTS did not recur 15 months after the surgery.

It has 2 distinct clinical forms: unicentric and multicentric. Unicentric Castleman's disease arising from an intrapulmonary lymph node is rare, and establishing a preoperative diagnosis of this disease is very difficult mainly due to a lack of specific imaging features. We report a case of intrapulmonary unicentric Castleman's disease in an asymptomatic 19-year-old male patient who was accurately diagnosed by preoperative computed tomography (CT). The mass was incidentally found on a routine chest X-ray. A subsequent dynamic CT showed a well-defined, hypervascular, soft-tissue mass with small calcifications located in the perihilar area of the right lower lung. Three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) angiography indicated that the mass was receiving its blood supply through a vascular network at its surface that originated from 2 right bronchial arteries. The clinical history and CT findings were consistent with a diagnosis of unicentric Castleman's disease, and we safely and successfully removed the tumor via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical lobectomy.

Pre-pubertal ovary-intact New Zealand white rabbits received daily oral administration of either vehicle (control) or RES (200 mg/kg) until growth plate fusion occurred. Bone growth and growth plate size were longitudinally monitored by X-ray imaging, while at the endpoint, bone length was assessed by a digital caliper. In addition, pubertal ovariectomized (OVX) rabbits were treated with vehicle, RES or estradiol cypionate (positive control) for 7 or 10 weeks and fetal rat metatarsal bones were cultured in vitro with RES (0.03 \u00b5M-50 \u00b5M) and followed for up to 19 days. In ovary-intact rabbits, sixteen-week treatment with RES increased tibiae and vertebrae bone growth and subsequently improved final length. In OVX rabbits, RES delayed fusion of the distal tibia, distal femur and proximal tibia epiphyses and femur length and vertebral bone growth increased when compared with controls. Histomorphometrical analysis showed that RES-treated OVX rabbits had a wider distal femur growth plate, enlarged resting zone, increased number/size of hypertrophic chondrocytes, increased height of the hypertrophic zone, and suppressed chondrocyte expression of VEGF and laminin. In cultured fetal rat metatarsal bones, RES stimulated growth at 0.3 \u00b5M while at higher concentrations (10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) growth was inhibited. We conclude that RES has the potential to improve longitudinal bone growth. The effect was associated with a delay of growth plate fusion resulting in increased final length. These effects were accompanied by a profound suppression of VEGF and laminin expression suggesting that impairment of growth plate vascularization might be an underlying mechanism.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-07-11", "authors": ["ElhamKarimian", "ChenTamm", "Andrei SChagin", "KarinSamuelsson", "Krist\u00edn R\u00f3sKjartansd\u00f3ttir", "ClaesOhlsson", "LarsS\u00e4vendahl"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067859"}

Consistently, ChIP analysis revealed multiple binding sites for beta-actin in the Gata2 promoter. Gata2 mRNA levels were almost completely rescued by expression of an erythroid lineage restricted ROSA26-promotor based GATA2 transgene. As a result, erythroid differentiation was restored and the knockout embryos showed significant improvement in yolk sac and embryo vascularization.

{"title": "The axonal guidance cue semaphorin 3C contributes to alveolar growth and repair.", "abstract": "Lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants and emphysema lack efficient treatments. Understanding the mechanisms contributing to normal and impaired alveolar growth and repair may identify new therapeutic targets for these lung diseases. Axonal guidance cues are molecules that guide the outgrowth of axons. Amongst these axonal guidance cues, members of the Semaphorin family, in particular Semaphorin 3C (Sema3C), contribute to early lung branching morphogenesis. The role of Sema3C during alveolar growth and repair is unknown. We hypothesized that Sema3C promotes alveolar development and repair. In vivo Sema3C knock down using intranasal siRNA during the postnatal stage of alveolar development in rats caused significant air space enlargement reminiscent of BPD. Sema3C knock down was associated with increased TLR3 expression and lung inflammatory cells influx. In a model of O2-induced arrested alveolar growth in newborn rats mimicking BPD, air space enlargement was associated with decreased lung Sema3C mRNA expression. In vitro, Sema3C treatment preserved alveolar epithelial cell viability in hyperoxia and accelerated alveolar epithelial cell wound healing. Sema3C preserved lung microvascular endothelial cell vascular network formation in vitro under hyperoxic conditions. In vivo, Sema3C treatment of hyperoxic rats decreased lung neutrophil influx and preserved alveolar and lung vascular growth. Sema3C also preserved lung plexinA2 and Sema3C expression, alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and decreased lung apoptosis. In conclusion, the axonal guidance cue Sema3C promotes normal alveolar growth and may be worthwhile further investigating as a potential therapeutic target for lung repair.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-07-11", "authors": ["ArulVadivel", "Rajesh SAlphonse", "Jennifer J PCollins", "Timvan Haaften", "MeganO'Reilly", "FarahEaton", "BernardTh\u00e9baud"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0067225"}

To investigate vascularization by semiquantitative analyses, these biofunctionalized scaffolds were then subjected to in vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cells formation assays, and were also investigated in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis model, an in vivo angiogenesis assay, which uses the CAM of the hen's egg. In their native, nonbiofunctionalized state, neither Bioglass(\u00ae)-based nor biologically inert fibrous polypropylene control scaffolds showed angiogenic properties. However, significant vascularization was induced by hASC-seeded scaffolds (Bioglass(\u00ae) and polypropylene) in the CAM angiogenesis assay. Biofunctionalized scaffolds also showed enhanced tube lengths, compared to unmodified scaffolds or constructs seeded with fibroblasts. In case of biologically inert hernia meshes, the quantification of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion as the key angiogenic stimulus strongly correlated to the tube lengths and vessel numbers in all models. This correlation proved the CAM angiogenesis assay to be a suitable semiquantitative tool to characterize angiogenic effects of larger 3D implants.

In this report we attempt to analyze perioperative factors associated with failures. Such factors are generally independent of technical performance and can be assessed to better define regulations applied to VCA. Ninety-one VCA procedures were identified, and 18 (19.8%) of them failed. Significant (P < 0.05) failure rates were associated with idiosyncratic cases (100%), cases performed without psychological screening (56.3%), cases performed without competent social support systems (44%), and cases done in developing countries (52.4%). A substantial but not significant failure rate was observed in cases performed without institutional review (36.4%). These findings suggest that institutional, professional, social, and ethical standards applied to VCA should require clarification of perioperative risk managements for any clinical VCA program, because such managements can be critical factors in determining outcome.

To investigate whether modulating lymphatic vessel function might affect the course of chronic inflammation, the major lymphangiogenic receptor, vascular growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3, FLT4), was blocked in an established model of inflammatory bowel disease.\nInterleukin 10 (IL10)-deficient mice that spontaneously develop inflammatory bowel disease were treated with a blocking antibody to VEGFR-3 for 18 days, and the inflammatory changes in colon tissue and the blood and lymphatic vascularization were quantitatively analyzed.\nWe found a significant increase in the severity of colon inflammation in anti-VEGFR-3-treated mice. This was accompanied by an increased number of enlarged and tortuous lymphatic vessels and edema in colon submucosa, indicating impaired lymphatic function. In contrast, no major effects of the treatment on the blood vasculature were observed.\nThese results indicate that therapies aimed at promoting lymphatic function, e.g., with prolymphangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-C, might provide a novel strategy for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease.", "journal": "Inflammatory bowel diseases", "date": "2013-07-10", "authors": ["GiorgiaJurisic", "John PSundberg", "MichaelDetmar"], "doi": "10.1097/MIB.0b013e31829292f7"}

Among the many RTKs, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) stands out for its multiple effects on immunity, vascularization, and cell migration. Herein, we examined whether VEGFR participated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. We found that RTK inhibitors (RTKIs) and VEGF or VEGFR-2 antibodies reversed diabetes when administered at the onset of hyperglycemia. Increased VEGF expression promoted islet vascular remodeling in NOD mice, and inhibition of VEGFR activity with RTKIs abrogated the increase in islet vascularity, impairing T-cell migration into the islet and improving glucose control. Metabolic studies confirmed that RTKIs worked by preserving islet function, as treated mice had improved glucose tolerance without affecting insulin sensitivity. Finally, examination of human pancreata from patients with T1D revealed that VEGFR-2 was confined to the islet vascularity, which was increased in inflamed islets. Collectively, this work reveals a previously unappreciated role for VEGFR-2 signaling in the pathogenesis of T1D by controlling T-cell accessibility to the pancreatic islets and highlights a novel application of VEGFR-2 antagonists for the therapeutic treatment of T1D.", "journal": "Diabetes", "date": "2013-07-10", "authors": ["S ArmandoVillalta", "JienaLang", "SamanthaKubeck", "BeniwendeKabre", "Gregory LSzot", "BorisCalderon", "CliveWasserfall", "Mark AAtkinson", "Rolf ABrekken", "NickPullen", "Robert HArch", "Jeffrey ABluestone"], "doi": "10.2337/db12-1619"}

We assessed the impact of lymphopenia on cardiac allograft survival in recipients conditioned with peritransplant costimulatory blockade (CB) to promote long-term graft acceptance. After vascularized MHC-mismatched heterotopic heart grafts were stably accepted through CB, lymphopenia was induced on day 60 posttransplant by 6.5 Gy irradiation or by administration of anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 mAb. Long-term surviving allografts were gradually rejected after lymphodepletion (MST = 74 \u00b1 5 days postirradiation). Histological analyses indicated signs of severe rejection in allografts following lymphodepletion, including mononuclear cell infiltration and obliterative vasculopathy. Lymphodepletion of CB conditioned recipients induced increases in CD44(high) effector/memory T cells in lymphatic organs and strong recovery of donor-reactive T cell responses, indicating lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) and donor alloimmune responses occurring in the host. T regulatory (CD4(+) Foxp(3+)) cell and B cell numbers as well as donor-specific antibody titers also increased during allograft rejection in CB conditioned recipients given lymphodepletion. These observations suggest that allograft rejection following partial lymphocyte depletion is mediated by LIP of donor-reactive memory T cells.

{"title": "Primary vascularization of allografts governs their immunogenicity and susceptibility to tolerogenesis.", "abstract": "We investigated the influence of allograft primary vascularization on alloimmunity, rejection, and tolerance in mice. First, we showed that fully allogeneic primarily vascularized and conventional skin transplants were rejected at the same pace. Remarkably, however, short-term treatment of mice with anti-CD40L Abs achieved long-term survival of vascularized skin and cardiac transplants but not conventional skin grafts. Nonvascularized skin transplants triggered vigorous direct and indirect proinflammatory type 1 T cell responses (IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3), whereas primarily vascularized skin allografts failed to trigger a significant indirect alloresponse. A similar lack of indirect alloreactivity was also observed after placement of different vascularized organ transplants, including hearts and kidneys, whereas hearts placed under the skin (nonvascularized) triggered potent indirect alloresponses. Altogether, these results suggest that primary vascularization of allografts is associated with a lack of indirect T cell alloreactivity. Finally, we show that long-term survival of vascularized skin allografts induced by anti-CD40L Abs was associated with a combined lack of indirect alloresponse and a shift of the direct alloresponse toward a type 2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-10)-secretion pattern but no activation/expansion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.

{"title": "Learning from rejection: what transplantation teaches us about (other) vascular pathologies.", "abstract": "Allograft vasculopathy is an accelerated intimal hyperplastic lesion leading to progressive vascular stenosis; it represents the major long-term limitation to successful solid organ transplant. Although allograft vasculopathy is not formally an autoimmune disease, nor does it constitute a major cause of cardiovascular disease on a purely numerical basis, its pathogenesis provides an important window on the mechanisms by which immune injury can drive more common vascular pathologic entities. Thus, insights gleaned from vascularized solid organ transplants can shed new mechanistic (and therapeutic) light on: 1) the intimal vascular responses accompanying typical atherosclerosis and other inflammatory vessel diseases (e.g., scleroderma); 2) the pathogenesis of vascular stenosis versus aneurysm formation; 3) the sources of intimal smooth muscle cells in the healing of any vascular injury; and 4) the mechanisms by which smooth muscle cells are recruited into intimal lesions. Indeed, research on allograft vasculopathy has led to the understanding that interferon-\u03b3 plays a similar pathogenic role in a host of vascular stenosing lesions-and that Th2 cytokines can drive vascular remodeling and aneurysm formation. Moreover, circulating precursors (and not just medial smooth muscle cells) contribute to the intimal hyperplasia seen in atherosclerosis and in-stent restenosis. That non-vessel smooth muscle cells can be recruited to sites of vessel injury further suggests that chemokine and adhesion molecule interactions may be viable targets to limit vascular stenosis in a wide range of vascular lesions. This review will describe the pathogenesis of allograft vasculopathy, and will relate how understanding the underlying pathways informs our understanding of both human transplant-associated disease, as well as other human vascular pathologies.", "journal": "Journal of autoimmunity", "date": "2013-07-09", "authors": ["Richard NMitchell"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jaut.2013.05.006"}

{"title": "Vascularized bone graft is a better option for the reconstruction of maxillary defects.", "abstract": "We read the article of Kinnunen et al., which evaluated the result of maxillary defects, and feel some objections. We present our considerations of their operative indication and thoughts based on our surgical experiences. Defects after palatectomy, which have left no dentition for the retention of an obturator, require vascularized bone-containing free flaps. Local flaps are available in only small defects of Class 1 and 2a. Most palatomaxillary defects following malignant tumor abrasion are classified as 2b, 2c, 3, or 4, which require microsurgical free flap transfer combined with bony reconstruction. Regarding bony reconstruction, non-vascularized bone grafts tend to be absorbed. Thus, we believe that bony reconstruction should be performed with vascularized bone. We agree with the authors' comment that PTMF may be useful in repairing defects due to complications in microvascular procedures in the palatal area. However, even when bone segment is required for salvage surgery, using a vascularized bone flap is more preferable. A parietal bone-fascial-periosteal flap based on the superficial temporal vessels is a suitable and reliable bone flap for the reconstruction of a maxillary defect following free skin flap transfer to the palate.", "journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "date": "2013-07-05", "authors": ["MasakiFujioka", "KenjiHayashida", "ChikakoMurakami"], "doi": "10.1007/s00405-013-2619-5"}

Despite many reports describing functional cell differentiation, no studies have succeeded in generating a three-dimensional vascularized organ such as liver. Here we show the generation of vascularized and functional human liver from human iPSCs by transplantation of liver buds created in vitro (iPSC-LBs). Specified hepatic cells (immature endodermal cells destined to track the hepatic cell fate) self-organized into three-dimensional iPSC-LBs by recapitulating organogenetic interactions between endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Immunostaining and gene-expression analyses revealed a resemblance between in vitro grown iPSC-LBs and in vivo liver buds. Human vasculatures in iPSC-LB transplants became functional by connecting to the host vessels within 48\u2009hours. The formation of functional vasculatures stimulated the maturation of iPSC-LBs into tissue resembling the adult liver. Highly metabolic iPSC-derived tissue performed liver-specific functions such as protein production and human-specific drug metabolism without recipient liver replacement. Furthermore, mesenteric transplantation of iPSC-LBs rescued the drug-induced lethal liver failure model. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a functional human organ from pluripotent stem cells.

Management of patients with an open abdomen and an enteroatmospheric fistula is very challenging. Intensive care support of organs and systems is vital in order to manage the severely septic patient and the associated multiple organ failure syndrome. Many of the principles applied to classic enterocutaneous fistulae are used as well. Control of enteric spillage, attempts to seal the fistula, and techniques of peritoneal access for excision of the involved loop are reviewed in this report.

To evaluate this possibility, human carotid artery endothelial (HCtAE) cells were cultured and cellular migration and the proinflammatory and/or thrombotic activity of SAA (0, 1 or 10 \u03bcg/mL) on vascular endothelial cells was verified by determining gene regulation relative to control (in the absence of SAA). Exposure of HCtAE cells to SAA increased expression of the transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NFKB), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and pro-coagulative tissue factor (F3), and stimulated phosphorylation of the P65 subunit of the NFKB complex. Enhanced production of TNF and NFKB was paralleled by increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression, as demonstrated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and ELISA. Administration of 10 \u03bcg/mL SAA enhanced endothelial cell migration (1.6-fold vs control), stimulated regrowth of HCtAE cells after mechanical injury (~1.2-fold vs control) and increased endothelial tube formation relative to control after 6 h. The SAA-mediated enhancement of endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation were markedly inhibited by pretreatment of HCtAE cells with the multi-angiokinase receptor inhibitor BIBF1120 (100 nmol/L), although SAA-stimulated gene responses for F3 and NFKB were unaffected by 100 nmol/L BIBF1120 pretreatment.

After the degree of decellularization was assessed, the fetal porcine aorta and mesenteric acellular matrix (FPAMAM) were transplanted into dogs.\nGross and histologic examination demonstrated the removal of cellular constituents with preservation of ECM architecture, including macrochannels and microchannels. The residual DNA content in the FPAMAM was less than 2\u00a0%. The aorta and microchannels were perfused well, and the fetal porcine aorta had good patency for more than 3\u00a0months.\nThe integrity of the FPAMAM provided a scaffold for the reconstruction of a rich vascular network with numerous segmentally radiating branches.

Three major lines of thought regarding the molecular mechanisms of immune privilege in the eye are as follows: (a) anatomical, cellular, and molecular barriers in the eye; (b) anterior chamber-associated immune deviation; and (c) immunosuppressive microenvironment in the eye. However, cornea transplants suffer allograft rejection when breached by vascularization. In recent developments, cellular corneal transplantation from cultivated limbal epithelial cells has shown impressive advances as a future therapy. The limbal stem cell niche contains stem cells that promote proliferation and migration and have immunosuppressive mechanisms to protect them from immunological reactions. Limbal stem cells are also noted to display an enhanced expression of genes for the antiapoptotic proteins, a property that is imperative for the survival of transplanted tissues. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms regulating the immune regulation of limbal stem cells is relevant in the clinical setting to promote the survival of whole corneal and limbal stem cell transplantation.", "journal": "Stem cells translational medicine", "date": "2013-07-03", "authors": ["BakiahShaharuddin", "SajjadAhmad", "AnnetteMeeson", "SimiAli"], "doi": "10.5966/sctm.2012-0143"}
{"title": "Activin Receptor-like kinase 1: a novel anti-angiogenesis target from TGF-\u03b2 family.", "abstract": "Anti-angiogenic therapy represents a very promising approach in cancer treatment, as most tumors needs to be supplied by a functional vascular network in order to grow beyond the local boundaries and metastatize. The accessibility of vessels to drug delivery and the broad spectrum of cancers treatable with the same compound have arisen interest in research of suitable molecules, with several, especially targeting the VEGF pathway, entered in clinical trials and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Despite good results, the major hurdle resides in the limited duration of an effective clinical response before tumors start to grow again. Thus, researchers are looking for different alternative targets for a combined and parallel multi-targeting of angiogenic signaling circuits. Activin Receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor with high affinity for the BMP9 member of Bone Morphogenic Proteins superfamily: it is expressed mainly, even if not exclusively, on endothelial cells and seems to be involved in the regulatory phase of angiogenesis. Despite a non-completely elucidated mechanism, the targeting of this pathway, both by a soluble ALK1-Fc receptor developed by Acceleron Pharma and by a fully human monoclonal antibody developed by Pfizer, has achieved encouraging results. After having briefly summarized the state of the art of anti-angiogenic therapy, we will first review existing evidence about the molecular mechanisms of ALK1 signaling and we will then analyse in detail the pre-clinical and clinical data available about these two drugs.", "journal": "Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry", "date": "2013-07-03", "authors": ["LucaVecchia", "CarlaOlivieri", "ClaudiaScotti"], "doi": "10.2174/13895575113139990065"}

{"title": "An automated method for retinal arteriovenous nicking quantification from color fundus images.", "abstract": "Retinal arteriovenous (AV) nicking is one of the prominent and significant microvascular abnormalities. It is characterized by the decrease in the venular caliber at both sides of an artery-vein crossing. Recent research suggests that retinal AV nicking is a strong predictor of eye diseases such as branch retinal vein occlusion and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke. In this study, we present a novel method for objective and quantitative AV nicking assessment. From the input retinal image, the vascular network is first extracted using the multiscale line detection method. The crossover point detection method is then performed to localize all AV crossing locations. At each detected crossover point, the four vessel segments, two associated with the artery and two associated with the vein, are identified and two venular segments are then recognized through the artery-vein classification method. The vessel widths along the two venular segments are measured and analyzed to compute the AV nicking severity of that crossover. The proposed method was validated on 47 high-resolution retinal images obtained from two population-based studies. The experimental results indicate a strong correlation between the computed AV nicking values and the expert grading with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.70. Sensitivity was 77% and specificity was 92% (Kappa \u03ba = 0.70) when comparing AV nicking detected using the proposed method to that detected using a manual grading method, performed by trained photographic graders.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2013-06-29", "authors": ["Uyen T VNguyen", "AlauddinBhuiyan", "Laurence A FPark", "RyoKawasaki", "Tien YWong", "Jie JinWang", "PaulMitchell", "KotagiriRamamohanarao"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2013.2271035"}

Twenty-three articles were screened and identified from the time period 1972 to 2012, representing two general treatment groups: decompression with flap interposition and repeated open decompression. A meta-analysis was then performed, generating forest and funnel plots of the data.\nIn total, 294 patients from 14 studies in the flap arm of the meta-analysis had a weighted success rate of 86 percent (95 percent CI, 0.75 to 0.96), and 364 patients from nine studies in the nonflap arm had a weighted 75 percent success rate (95 percent CI, 0.66 to 0.84). Heterogeneity was statistically analyzed and revealed low heterogeneity with the I statistic. Forest plots were created and analyzed between subgroups, and chi-square analysis revealed a highly statistically significant difference (p = 0.001). The odds ratio of success in the nonflap group was 0.50 (95 percent CI, 0.33 to 0.75).\nDecompression with the use of vascularized flap coverage appears to have a higher success rate over simple repeated decompression.

After total RNA was extracted from each dissected ocular tissue, the RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.\nThe RIN values from corneal and trabecular meshwork tissues were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those from the ciliary body at an earlier DP time (<6 h), but were not different among all tissues after 8 h. Interestingly, the RIN values from non-vascularized tissues were significantly (p=0.0002) higher than those from vascularized ocular tissues at early DP times (<6 h). The RIN value from the cornea was significantly (p<0.05) higher at short DP times compared to longer DP times. The RIN values from corneal tissues were significantly correlated to DP time according to regression analysis (p<0.05).\nIn this study, we determined RNA quality from postmortem ocular tissues with various DP times.

The single-kidney glomerular filtration rate (SK-GFR) was measured in 15 patients with atherosclerotic RAS with DCE-MRI and radioisotopes at baseline and 4 mo after revascularization. DCE-MRI also produced measurements of blood flow, blood volume, extraction fraction, tubular transit time, and functional volume. Stented kidneys (n = 22) were divided into three response groups on the basis of the changes in radioisotope SK-GFR: improved (n = 5), stable (n = 13), and deteriorated (n = 4). A good agreement was found between SK-GFR values from DCE-MRI and radioisotopes (correlation coefficient: 0.91). Before intervention, kidneys that improved had lower extraction fraction, higher blood volume, longer tubular transit time, and lower SK-GFR. After intervention, improved kidneys had increased functional volume, and deteriorated kidneys had reduced functional volume and extraction fraction. Revascularization improved blood flow and blood volume in all groups. This pilot study led to the hypothesis that well-vascularized kidneys with reduced extraction fractions are most likely to benefit from revascularization.

{"title": "Oatp58Dc contributes to blood-brain barrier function by excluding organic anions from the Drosophila brain.", "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) physiologically isolates the brain from the blood and, thus, plays a vital role in brain homeostasis. Ion transporters play a critical role in this process by effectively regulating access of chemicals to the brain. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatps) transport a wide range of amphipathic substrates and are involved in efflux of chemicals across the vertebrate BBB. The anatomic complexity of the vascularized vertebrate BBB, however, creates challenges for experimental analysis of these processes. The less complex structure of the Drosophila BBB facilitates measurement of solute transport. Here we investigate a physiological function for Oatp58Dc in transporting small organic anions across the BBB. We used genetic manipulation, immunocytochemistry, and molecular techniques to supplement a whole animal approach to study the BBB. For this whole animal approach, the traceable small organic anion fluorescein was injected into the hemolymph. This research shows that Oatp58Dc is involved in maintaining a chemical barrier against fluorescein permeation into the brain. Oatp58Dc expression was found in the perineurial and subperineurial glia, as well as in postmitotic neurons. We specifically targeted knockdown of Oatp58Dc expression in the perineurial and subperineurial glia to reveal that Oatp58Dc expression in the perineurial glia is necessary to maintain the barrier against fluorescein influx into the brain.

This study aimed to determine whether these defects could be classified and repaired at a single stage.

They were classified into four types on the basis of the conditions of the bone defects, soft tissue defects, and injured limb length, including Type A (without soft tissue defects), Type B (with soft tissue defects of 10 \u00d7 20 cm or less), Type C (with soft tissue defects of 10 \u00d7 20 cm or more), and Type D (with the limb shortening of 3 cm or more). Four types of single-stage microsurgical repair protocols were planned accordingly and implemented respectively. These protocols included the following: Protocol A, where vascularized fibular graft was implemented for Type A; Protocol B, where vascularized fibular osteoseptocutaneous graft was implemented for Type B; Protocol C, where vascularized fibular graft and anterior lateral thigh flap were used for Type C; and Protocol D, where limb lengthening and Protocols A, B, or C were used for Type D. There were 12, 33, 4, and 2 cases of Types A, B, C, and D, respectively, according to this classification. During the surgery, three cases of planned Protocol B had to be shifted into Protocol C; however, all microsurgical repairs were completed.

{"title": "Brown adipose tissue: research milestones of a potential player in human energy balance and obesity.", "abstract": "Obesity and diabetes mellitus are worldwide epidemics driven by the disruption in energy balance. In recent years, it was discovered that functional brown adipose tissue (BAT), once thought to exist mainly in infants, is present in adults, and can be detected during cold stimulation, and is associated with decreased adiposity. Brown fat pads were shown to be highly vascularized and metabolically active and on stimulation, they caused enhanced energy expenditure and increased glucose and fatty acid uptake. These observations drew attention to the possibility that nonshivering thermogenesis mediated by activation of BAT might be important in human energy balance and a potential tool to counter obesity. Recent investigations have revealed significant advances in the understanding of the role of BAT-mediated thermogenesis, uncovering essential knowledge on the origin, differentiation, activation, and regulation of BAT in both murine models and humans. In addition to classic BAT depots, transformation of white adipocytes into brown-like adipocytes, and the development of \"beige\" cells from distinct precursors, were demonstrated in different animal models and resulted in increased thermogenic activity. Several transcription factors, activating proteins, and hormones are increasingly identified as regulating the development and function of both brown-like adipocytes and classic brown fat pads. This review will summarize the evolution of research on BAT in humans, in light of the renewed scientific interest and growing body of evidence showing that recruitment and activation of BAT and browning of white adipose tissue can affect energy expenditure and may be a future feasible target in the treatment of metabolic diseases.", "journal": "Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme", "date": "2013-06-28", "authors": ["BZafrir"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0033-1348264"}

Hematologic and biochemical analyses, abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography, and abdominocentesis with cytologic and biochemical analysis revealed no significant abnormalities. Cytological examination of an aqueous humor sample revealed a population of predominantly large lymphoblasts with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, round or irregular nuclei, clumped nuclear chromatin, multiple large prominent nucleoli, and a small volume of basophilic cytoplasm. The cytologic diagnosis was intraocular lymphoma. Biopsy of the right submandibular lymph node revealed no evidence of neoplastic invasion. Euthanasia and a complete necropsy were performed and revealed no evidence of neoplasia in any tissue other than the right eye, which had an extensive, well-defined infiltrate of neoplastic lymphocytes expanding the ciliary body and iris, infiltrating the ciliary epithelium, and extending into the pars plana and peripheral choroid. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that neoplastic cells expressed the T-cell marker CD3. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of primary, solitary uveal T-cell lymphoma in a horse. Although apparently rare, lymphoma should be considered in horses with uveitis, even when inflammation is unilateral and in the absence of extraocular signs of neoplasia.

{"title": "Water transport across the peritoneal membrane.", "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis involves diffusive and convective transports and osmosis through the highly vascularized peritoneal membrane. The capillary endothelium offers the rate-limiting hindrance for solute and water transport. It can be functionally described in terms of a three-pore model including transcellular, ultrasmall pores responsible for free-water transport during crystalloid osmosis. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP1) corresponds to the ultrasmall pore located in endothelial cells. Studies in Aqp1 mice have shown that deletion of AQP1 is reflected by a 50% decrease in ultrafiltration and a disappearance of the sodium sieving. Haploinsufficiency in AQP1 is also reflected by a significant attenuation of water transport. Conversely, studies in a rat model and in PD patients have shown that the induction of AQP1 in peritoneal capillaries by corticosteroids is reflected by increased water transport and ultrafiltration, without affecting the osmotic gradient and small-solute transport. Recent data have demonstrated that a novel agonist of AQP1, predicted to stabilize the open-state conformation of the channel, modulates water transport and improves ultrafiltration. Whether increasing the expression of AQP1 or gating the already existing channels would be clinically useful in PD patients remains to be investigated.", "journal": "Kidney international", "date": "2013-06-27", "authors": ["OlivierDevuyst", "BengtRippe"], "doi": "10.1038/ki.2013.250"}

Eight Syrian golden hamsters had their right buccal pouch treated with DMBA 0.5% and 10% carbamide peroxide for 90 days in order to produce squamous cell carcinoma in this site. Next, buccal pouches of the animals were submitted to the vascular corrosion technique and then analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The vascular figures of sprouts were observed in the entire vascular network of the buccal pouches, as opposed to the intussusceptive angiogenesis that was predominantly observed in the sub-epithelial network. It was possible to differentiate the figures of sprouts from artifacts by the analysis of the blind ending of these structures. Intussusceptive angiogenesis was identified by the presence of holes trespassing the lumen of the capillaries. Vascular expansion occurred through intussusceptive angiogenesis in two ways: by the fusion of the pillars to form a new capillary and, by increasing the girth of the pillar to form meshes.

{"title": "Identification of inter-organ vascular network: vessels bridging between organs.", "abstract": "Development and homeostasis of organs and whole body is critically dependent on the circulatory system. In particular, the circulatory system, the railways shuttling oxygen and nutrients among various organs, is indispensible for inter-organ humoral communication. Since the modern view of the anatomy and mechanics of the circulatory system was established in 17(th) century, it has been assumed that humoral factors are carried to and from organs via vascular branches of the central arteries and veins running along the body axis. Over the past few decades, major advances have been made in understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the vascularization of organs. However, very little is known about how each organ is linked by vasculature (i.e., inter-organ vascular networks). In fact, the exact anatomy of inter-organ vascular networks has remained obscure. Herein, we report the identification of four distinct vessels, V1(LP), V2(LP), V3(LP) and V4(LP), that bridge between two organs, liver and pancreas in developing zebrafish. We found that these inter-organ vessels can be classified into two types: direct and indirect types. The direct type vessels are those that bridge between two organs via single distinct vessel, to which V1(LP) and V2(LP) vessels belong. The indirect type bridges between two organs via separate branches that emanate from a stem vessel, and V3(LP) and V4(LP) vessels belong to this type. Our finding of V1(LP), V2(LP), V3(LP) and V4(LP) vessels provides the proof of the existence of inter-organ vascular networks. These and other yet-to-be-discovered inter-organ vascular networks may facilitate the direct exchange of humoral factors that are necessary for the coordinated growth, differentiation and homeostasis of the connected organs. It is also possible that the inter-organ vessels serve as tracks for their connected organs to follow during their growth to establish their relative positions and size differences.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-06-27", "authors": ["MadokaOmae", "NorioTakada", "ShoheiYamamoto", "HiroyukiNakajima", "Thomas NSato"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0065720"}

Laser treatment was performed at 830 nm wavelength, 100 mW (energy 80 J/cm(2), 2.2 J), for 22 s in the vestibular surface and 22 s in the palatal surface, 1 mm away from the dental root mucosa. Three staining methods were performed: hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Masson's Trichrome method and Gomori's method.\nThe pulp histology parameters were evaluated and the results classified in to 3 parts: an inflammatory response, soft tissue response (dental pulp) and hard tissue response (dentin and predentin). There was no inflammation (chronic or acute) in any of the evaluated groups. The zones of pulp necrosis were found in one premolar of G3 and in one of G4; in groups G2 and G4 there was higher angiogenesis than in the other two groups. G4 group presented the highest level of vascularization. A reduced nerve density was observed in G3. A G2 specimen showed increased nerve density. A higher rate of calcification was observed in G1 compared to G2. Denticles, either real or false, were observed in G1, G2 and G3. Sclerosis of dentin and focal dentin loss was observed among all the groups. Secondary dentin was present in one sample in G1 and G2. A necrosis zone was found in one sample of G3 and G4. No differences between groups were observed in the odontoblast irregularity layer but the layer was wider in the group treated with laser only. A notable difference was detected in reduction of the cell-free layer between the groups G1 and G4. The findings in pulp tissue favor its adaptative response against dental movement induced by orthodontics. No definitive conclusions may be derived as this is a pilot study.\nThe protocol described here was shown to be an effective method to evaluate changes in dental pulp submitted to low level laser in teeth under orthodontic movement.", "journal": "World journal of methodology", "date": "2013-06-26", "authors": ["AngelaDom\u00ednguez", "Rosa EmiliaBallesteros", "Jairo Hern\u00e1nVi\u00e1fara", "Oscar MarioTamayo"], "doi": "10.5662/wjm.v3.i2.19"}
{"title": "Photoreceptor avascular privilege is shielded by soluble VEGF receptor-1.", "abstract": "Optimal phototransduction requires separation of the avascular photoreceptor layer from the adjacent vascularized inner retina and choroid. Breakdown of peri-photoreceptor vascular demarcation leads to retinal angiomatous proliferation or choroidal neovascularization, two variants of vascular invasion of the photoreceptor layer in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized nations. Here we show that sFLT-1, an endogenous inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), is synthesized by photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and is decreased in human AMD. Suppression of sFLT-1 by antibodies, adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, or Cre/lox-mediated gene ablation either in the photoreceptor layer or RPE frees VEGF-A and abolishes photoreceptor avascularity. These findings help explain the vascular zoning of the retina, which is critical for vision, and advance two transgenic murine models of AMD with spontaneous vascular invasion early in life.

In most cases, some kind of intercalary bone graft is used to bridge the bony defect. However, due to low stability of a single fibula autograft and disadvantages of exogenous graft material when performing combined allo- and autograft reconstruction, efforts to develop new surgical techniques, with the intention to lower the complication rates, are ongoing.\nWe present a detailed description of the surgical technique and the outcome of three patients with osteosarcomas of the proximal humerus, which were treated with tumor resection and autologous double-barrel vascularized fibula bone graft for arthrodesis of the shoulder. The construct was stabilized using a 4.5-mm pelvic reconstruction plate positioned on the scapular spine and the lateral aspect of the humerus.\nA wide surgical margin was achieved in all patients. Two of them could be reintegrated and are able to work with excellent shoulder function. In one patient, who developed metastasis, a deep infection under chemotherapy 16\u00a0months after index surgery complicated the postoperative course.\nThe fibula's unique dual endosteal and periosteal blood supply makes it effective as a double-barrel bone graft for major long bone defects, which requires extra bone volume to prevent fractures until bone hypertrophy occurs.

Previously, we observed that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) increases cyclooxygenase-2 derived - prostaglandin E2 production during implantation in the rat uterus and that it augments the expression of decidualization (IGFBP-1) and vascularization (IL-10) markers. Both cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are known enzymes involved in these processes. Thus, we became interested in studying which factors contribute to LPA receptor-specific role during the decidual and the vascular reaction at implantation.\nWe adopted a pharmacological approach in\u00a0vitro incubating the uterus from rats on day 5 of gestation (day of implantation) with LPA, DGPP (a highly selective antagonist of LPA3, an LPA receptor) and cyclooxygenase and NOS selective and non-selective inhibitors. We determined NOS activity, prostaglandin E2 production and IGFBP-1 and IL-10 expression to evaluate decidualization and vascularization.\nWe observed that LPA augmented the activity of the inducible NOS isoform through LPA1/LPA3. Inducible NOS activity participated in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 increase stimulated by LPA. Also, cyclooxygenase-2 derived prostaglandins mediated LPA-stimulatory action on NOS activity. Both cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NOS mediated LPA effect on IGFBP-1 and IL-10 expression.\nThese results suggest the participation of LPA/LPA3 in the production of crucial molecules involved in vascularization and decidualization, two main processes that prepare the uterine milieu for embryo invasion during implantation.", "journal": "Placenta", "date": "2013-06-25", "authors": ["J SBeltrame", "M SSordelli", "MCella", "SPerez Martinez", "A MFranchi", "M LRibeiro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.placenta.2013.06.001"}

Compared to primary somatic cells, ECs and SMCs, which were differentiated from hiPSCs, strongly cooperated to enhance in vitro tubular network formation. In vivo gel assays in athymic nude mice showed that the coimplantation of differentiated ECs and SMCs significantly increased vascularization, unlike that observed in the case of implantation of differentiated ECs alone. In a murine full-thickness wound model, when compared with the transplantation of primary somatic cells or phosphate-buffered saline, cotransplantation of differentiated ECs and SMCs markedly enhanced neovascularization in injured tissues and accelerated wound healing.

{"title": "Landscape of transcriptional deregulations in the preeclamptic placenta.", "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy disease affecting 5 to 8% of pregnant women and a leading cause of both maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Because of a default in the process of implantation, the placenta of preeclamptic women undergoes insufficient vascularization. This results in placental ischemia, inflammation and subsequent release of placental debris and vasoactive factors in the maternal circulation causing a systemic endothelial activation. Several microarray studies have analyzed the transcriptome of the preeclamptic placentas to identify genes which could be involved in placental dysfunction. In this study, we compared the data from publicly available microarray analyses to obtain a consensus list of modified genes. This allowed to identify consistently modified genes in the preeclamptic placenta. Of these, 67 were up-regulated and 31 down-regulated. Assuming that changes in the transcription level of co-expressed genes may result from the coordinated action of a limited number of transcription factors, we looked for over-represented putative transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of these genes. Indeed, we found that the promoters of up-regulated genes are enriched in putative binding sites for NFkB, CREB, ANRT, REEB1, SP1, and AP-2. In the promoters of down-regulated genes, the most prevalent putative binding sites are those of MZF-1, NFYA, E2F1 and MEF2A. These transcriptions factors are known to regulate specific biological pathways such as cell responses to inflammation, hypoxia, DNA damage and proliferation.

Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) is a naturally derived, absorbable polymer. P4HB has been manufactured into PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug designs for soft tissue repair. The objective of this study was to evaluate mechanical strength, resorption properties, and histologic characteristics in a porcine model. Methods. Bilateral defects were created in the abdominal wall of n = 20 Yucatan minipigs and repaired in a bridged fashion with PHASIX Mesh or P4HB Plug fixated with SorbaFix or permanent suture, respectively. Mechanical strength, resorption properties, and histologic characteristics were evaluated at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks (n = 5 each). Results. PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug repairs exhibited similar burst strength, stiffness, and molecular weight at all time points, with no significant differences detected between the two devices (P > 0.05). PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug repairs also demonstrated significantly greater burst strength and stiffness than native abdominal wall at all time points (P < 0.05), and material resorption increased significantly over time (P < 0.001). Inflammatory infiltrates were mononuclear, and both devices exhibited mild to moderate granulation tissue/vascularization. Conclusions. PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug demonstrated significant mechanical strength compared to native abdominal wall, despite significant material resorption over time.

Thirty-six large bone defects were repaired in rabbits using engineering bone composed of allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), bFGF, BMP-2 and scaffolds composed of PLGA/PCL/nHA loaded with PLCL/Col/nHA. The experiments were divided into six groups: BMSCs/bFGF/BMP-2/scaffold, BMSCs/BMP-2/scaffold, BMSCs/bFGF/scaffold, BMSCs/scaffold, scaffold alone and no treatment. Sodium alginate hydrogel was used as the carrier for BMP-2 and bFGF and its features, including gelling, degradation and controlled release properties, was detected by the determination of gelation and degradation time coupled with a controlled release study of bovine serum albumin (BSA). AlamarBlue assay and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were used to evaluate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in different groups. X-ray and histological examinations of the samples were performed after 4 and 12 weeks post-implantation to clarify new bone formation in the mandible defects. The results verified that the use of sodium alginate hydrogel as a controlled release carrier has good sustained release ability, and the combined application of bFGF and BMP-2 could significantly promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). In addition, X-ray and histological examinations of the samples exhibited that the dual release group had significantly higher bone formation than the other groups.

Drug delivery from BTE scaffolds to induce the formation of functional tissues, which may need to vary temporally and spatially, represents a versatile approach to manipulating the local environment for directing cell function and/or to treat common bone diseases or local infection. In addition, drug delivery from BTE is proposed to either increase the expression of tissue inductive factors or to block the expression of others factors that could inhibit bone tissue formation. Composite scaffolds which combine biopolymers and bioactive ceramics in mechanically competent 3D structures, including also organic-inorganic hybrids, are being widely developed for BTE, where the affinity and interaction between biomaterials and therapeutic drugs or biomolecular signals play a decisive role in controlling the release rate.\nThis review covers current developments and applications of 3D composite scaffolds for BTE which exhibit the added capability of controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs or growth factors. A summary of drugs and biomolecules incorporated in composite scaffolds and approaches developed to combine biopolymers and bioceramics in composites for drug delivery systems for BTE is presented. Special attention is given to identify the main challenges and unmet needs of current designs and technologies for developing such multifunctional 3D composite scaffolds for BTE.\nOne of the major challenges for developing composite scaffolds for BTE is the incorporation of a drug delivery function of sufficient complexity to be able to induce the release patterns that may be necessary for effective osseointegration, vascularization and bone regeneration. Loading 3D scaffolds with different biomolecular agents should produce a codelivery system with different, predetermined release profiles. It is also envisaged that the number of relevant bioactive agents that can be loaded onto scaffolds will be increased, whilst the composite scaffold design should exploit synergistically the different degradation profiles of the organic and inorganic components.", "journal": "Expert opinion on drug delivery", "date": "2013-06-20", "authors": ["VivianaMouri\u00f1o", "Juan PCattalini", "Judith ARoether", "PrachiDubey", "IpsitaRoy", "Aldo RBoccaccini"], "doi": "10.1517/17425247.2013.808183"}

A miR-126 binding site was predicted in the 3' UTR (untranslated region) of chicken Spred1. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-126 could bind to the predicted site to repress the expression of Spred1. These data validate Spred1 as a target gene of chicken miR-126.

{"title": "Accelerating the early angiogenesis of tissue engineering constructs in vivo by the use of stem cells cultured in matrigel.", "abstract": "In tissue engineering research, generating constructs with an adequate extent of clinical applications remains a major challenge. In this context, rapid blood vessel ingrowth in the transplanted tissue engineering constructs is the key factor for successful incorporation. To accelerate the microvascular development in engineered tissues, we preincubated osteoblast-like cells as well as mesenchymal stem cells or a combination of both cell types in Matrigel-filled PLGA scaffolds before transplantation into the dorsal skinfold chambers of balb/c mice. By the use of preincubated mesenchymal stem cells, a significantly accelerated angiogenesis was achieved. Compared with previous studies that showed a decisive increase of vascularization on day 6 after the implantation, we were able to halve this period and achieve explicitly denser microvascular networks 3 days after transplantation of the tissue engineering constructs. Thereby, the inflammatory host tissue response was acceptable and low, comparable with former investigations. A co-incubation of osteoblast-like cells and stem cells showed no additive effect on the density of the newly formed microvascular network. Preincubation of mesenchymal stem cells in Matrigel is a promising approach to develop rapid microvascular growth into tissue engineering constructs. After the implantation into the host organism, scaffolds comprising stem cells generate microvascular capillary-like structures exceptionally fast. Thereby, transplanted stem cells likely differentiate into vessel-associated cells. For this reason, preincubation of mesenchymal stem cells in nutrient solutions supporting different steps of angiogenesis provides a technique to promote the routine use of tissue engineering in the clinic.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

GelMA hydrogels containing human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be photopolymerized ex vivo and then surgically transplanted in vivo as a means to generate vascular networks. However, the full clinical potential of GelMA will be best captured by enabling minimally invasive implantation and in situ polymerization. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of bioengineering human vascular networks inside GelMA constructs that were first subcutaneously injected into immunodeficient mice while in liquid form, and then rapidly crosslinked via transdermal exposure to UV light. These bioengineered vascular networks developed within 7 days, formed functional anastomoses with the host vasculature, and were uniformly distributed throughout the constructs. Most notably, we demonstrated that the vascularization process can be directly modulated by adjusting the initial exposure time to UV light (15-45 s range), with constructs displaying progressively less vascular density and smaller average lumen size as the degree of GelMA crosslinking was increased.

What controls the formation of vascular strands with these properties?

By contrast, polar, continuous auxin transport-though required-is insufficient to promote internal alignment of vascular strands, implicating additional factors. The auxin canalization hypothesis was derived from the response of mature tissue to auxin application but is consistent with molecular and cellular events in embryo axis formation and shoot organ development. Objections to the hypothesis have been raised based on vascular organizations in callus tissue and shoot organs but seem unsupported by available evidence.

{"title": "Evolutionary implications of the divergent long bone histologies of Nothosaurus and Pistosaurus (Sauropterygia, Triassic).", "abstract": "Eosauropterygians consist of two major clades, the Nothosauroidea of the Tethysian Middle Triassic (e.g., Nothosaurus) and the Pistosauroidea. The Pistosauroidea include rare Triassic forms (Pistosauridae) and the Plesiosauria of the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Long bones of Nothosaurus and Pistosaurus from the Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic) of Germany and France and a femur of the Lower Jurassic Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus were studied histologically and microanatomically to understand the evolution of locomotory adaptations, patterns of growth and life history in these two lineages.\nWe found that the cortex of adult Nothosaurus long bones consists of lamellar zonal bone. Large Upper Muschelkalk humeri of large-bodied Nothosaurus mirabilis and N. giganteus differ from the small Lower Muschelkalk (Nothosaurus marchicus/N. winterswijkensis) humeri by a striking microanatomical specialization for aquatic tetrapods: the medullary cavity is much enlarged and the cortex is reduced to a few millimeters in thickness. Unexpectedly, the humeri of Pistosaurus consist of continuously deposited, radially vascularized fibrolamellar bone tissue like in the Plesiosaurus sample. Plesiosaurus shows intense Haversian remodeling, which has never been described in Triassic sauropterygians.\nThe generally lamellar zonal bone tissue of nothosaur long bones indicates a low growth rate and suggests a low basal metabolic rate. The large triangular cross section of large-bodied Nothosaurus from the Upper Muschelkalk with their large medullary region evolved to withstand high bending loads. Nothosaurus humerus morphology and microanatomy indicates the evolution of paraxial front limb propulsion in the Middle Triassic, well before its convergent evolution in the Plesiosauria in the latest Triassic. Fibrolamellar bone tissue, as found in Pistosaurus and Plesiosaurus, suggests a high growth rate and basal metabolic rate. The presence of fibrolamellar bone tissue in Pistosaurus suggests that these features had already evolved in the Pistosauroidea by the Middle Triassic, well before the plesiosaurs radiated. Together with a relatively large body size, a high basal metabolic rate probably was the key to the invasion of the Pistosauroidea of the pelagic habitat in the Middle Triassic and the success of the Plesiosauria in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.", "journal": "BMC evolutionary biology", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["AnnaKrahl", "NicoleKlein", "P MartinSander"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2148-13-123\n10.1080/02724634.2011.550363\n10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[76:NIOTSO]2.0.CO;2\n10.2475/ajs.246.1.46\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.1987.tb01351.x\n10.1666/0022-3360(2003)077<0738:ANSOTS>2.0.CO;2\n10.2517/1342-8144-14.3.179\n10.1080/02724634.1997.10010999\n10.1007/s12052-009-0139-y\n10.4202/app.2008.0083\n10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0577:TSOTPA]2.0.CO;2\n10.1016/S0031-0182(99)00067-X\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.1998.tb00568.x\n10.2475/ajs.293.A.63\n10.1660/062.113.0201\n10.1111/j.1469-7998.1987.tb05113.x\n10.1002/ar.20533\n10.1007/s10914-010-9130-1\n10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.02002.x\n10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01431.x\n10.1139/z89-300\n10.1098/rstb.1989.0103\n10.1007/BF00387004\n10.1016/S0016-6995(95)80216-9\n10.1111/j.1749-4877.2009.00146.x\n10.1016/j.tree.2005.08.012\n10.1666/0094-8373(2008)034[0247:OSITLB]2.0.CO;2\n10.1098/rsbl.2007.0254\n10.1666/0094-8373(2000)026<0466:LHOTTS>2.0.CO;2\n10.1111/j.1463-6395.1934.tb00661.x\n10.1144/gsjgs.153.6.0873\n10.1080/02724634.2010.483543\n10.1016/j.crpv.2011.03.009\n10.1126/science.1174638\n10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[326:APSAIH]2.0.CO;2\n10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030<0589:TEOLBM>2.0.CO;2\n10.1111/j.1463-6409.2005.00198.x\n10.1126/science.1120125\n10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027<0039:COOSEA>2.0.CO;2\n10.1038/nature03050\n10.1016/j.ode.2003.12.002\n10.1111/j.1096-3642.2000.tb02201.x\n10.1016/S0940-9602(04)80071-2\n10.1007/s001980170161\n10.1007/BF00687481\n10.1126/science.1187443\n10.1038/344858a0\n10.1016/j.jembe.2007.12.023\n10.1080/08912961003637066\n10.1126/science.1160904\n10.1371/journal.pone.0005361"}

{"title": "Assessment of mucocele formation after endoscopic nasoseptal flap reconstruction of skull base defects.", "abstract": "Advances in endoscopic skull base (SB) surgery have led to the resection of increasingly larger cranial base lesions, resulting in large SB defects. These defects have initially led to increased postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. The development of the vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNSF) has successfully reduced postoperative CSF leaks. Mucocele formation, however, has been reported as a complication of this technique. In this study, we analyze the incidence of mucocele formation after repair of SB defects using a PNSF. A retrospective review was performed from December 2008 to December 2011 to identify patients who underwent PNSF reconstruction for large ventral SB defects. Demographic data, defect site, incidence of postoperative CSF leaks, and rate of mucocele formation were collected. Seventy patients undergoing PNSF repair of SB defects were identified. No postoperative mucocele formation was noted at an average radiological follow-up of 11.7 months (range, 3-36.9 months) and clinical follow-up of 13.8 months (range, 3-38.9 months), making the overall mucocele rate 0%. The postoperative CSF leak rate was 2.9%. Proper closure of SB defects is crucial to prevent CSF leaks. The PNSF is an efficient technique for these repairs.

Previous reports focused the studies on the union rate and the revascularization of the transferred graft. However, the postoperative wrist stiffness still a challenging problem and remaining to be solved. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the combination of vascularized bone-grafting pedicled on 1,2 ICSRA and wrist external fixator immobilization provides a more effective strategy for treating established scaphoid nonunion complicated with AVN and improving postoperative range of motion (ROM) of the injured wrist.\nWe retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 11 patients who had cases of established scaphoid nonunion involving AVN of the proximal pole were treated with vascularized bone-grafting pedicled on 1,2 1,2 ICSRA, internal fixation, and wrist external fixator immobilization. Procedure of wrist arthrolysis was performed before vascularized bone graft transferring. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation included measurement of clinical (wrist ROM and grip strength), radiographic (intrascaphoid angle, scapholunate angle) and functional (Mayo wrist score) parameters.\nOsseous union was achieved in all of the 11 cases within an average period of 11.4 weeks. On an average 6.1 years follow-up, there were three excellent, six good and two fair results. Significant improvements were found for Mayo wrist score, wrist ROM, and grip strength (p < 0.01). Intrascaphoid angle and scapholunate angle were significantly improved postoperatively, and there was no significant difference between the postoperative values and the values at the last follow-up. Early functional rehabilitation of the injured wrist under the protection of the fixator did not result in displacement of the transferred graft.\nThe results of the present investigation support the use of the vascularized bone graft pedicled on 1,2 ICSRA in the treatment of scaphoid nonunion complicated with proximal pole AVN. Procedures of wrist arthrolysis and early institution of wrist functional rehabilitation under the protection of the external fixator play important role in the restoration of range of motion of the injured wrist. \u00a0", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["KLiang", "ZKe", "LChen", "MNie", "YCheng", "ZDeng"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Adipose tissue angiogenesis: impact on obesity and type-2 diabetes.", "abstract": "The growth and function of tissues are critically dependent on their vascularization. Adipose tissue is capable of expanding many-fold during adulthood, therefore requiring the formation of new vasculature to supply growing and proliferating adipocytes. The expansion of the vasculature in adipose tissue occurs through angiogenesis, where new blood vessels develop from those pre-existing within the tissue. Inappropriate angiogenesis may underlie adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity, which in turn increases type-2 diabetes risk. In addition, genetic and developmental factors involved in vascular patterning may define the size and expandability of diverse adipose tissue depots, which are also associated with type-2 diabetes risk. Moreover, the adipose tissue vasculature appears to be the niche for pre-adipocyte precursors, and factors that affect angiogenesis may directly impact the generation of new adipocytes. Here we review recent advances on the basic mechanisms of angiogenesis, and on the role of angiogenesis in adipose tissue development and obesity. A substantial amount of data points to a deficit in adipose tissue angiogenesis as a contributing factor to insulin resistance and metabolic disease in obesity. These emerging findings support the concept of the adipose tissue vasculature as a source of new targets for metabolic disease therapies.

{"title": "Macroporosity enhances vascularization of electrospun scaffolds.", "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in scaffold-based tissue engineering remains poor and inefficient penetration of cells into scaffolds to generate thick vascularized and cellular tissues. Electrospinning has emerged as a preferred method for producing scaffolds with high surface area-to-volume ratios and resemblance to extracellular matrix. However, cellular infiltration and vascular ingrowth are insufficient because of lack of macropore interconnectivity in electrospun scaffolds with high-fiber density. In this study, we report a novel two-step electrospinning and laser cutting fabrication method to enhance the macroporosity of electrospun scaffolds.\nPolycaprolactone dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol was electrospun at 25 kV to create uniform 100-120 \u03bcm sheets of polycaprolactone fiber mats (1- to 5-\u03bcm fiber diameter) with an array of pores created using VERSA LASER CUTTER 2.3. Three groups of fiber mats with three distinct pore diameters (300, 160, and 80 \u03bcm, all with 15% pore area) were fabricated and compared with a control group without laser cut pores. After laser cutting, all mats were collagen coated and manually wrapped around a catheter six times to form six concentric layers before implantation into the omentum of Lewis rats. Cellular infiltration and vascular ingrowth were examined after 2 wk.\nHistologic analysis of 14-d samples showed that scaffolds with laser cut pores had close to 40% more cellular infiltration and increased vascular ingrowth in the innermost layers of the construct compared with the control group. Despite keeping pore area percentage constant between the three groups, the sheets with the largest pore size performed better than those with the smallest pore sizes.\nPorosity is the primary factor limiting the extensive use of electrospun scaffolds in tissue engineering.

This suboptimal outcome is likely due to the fact that graft survival is compromised long term because grafts are subjected to a host's microglial inflammatory response, to a lack of adequate trophic support, and possibly to cortical excitotoxicity. However, graft demise may also relate to more straightforward issues such as cell preparation methodology (solid grafts vs. cell suspension). Indeed, we recently reported that solid grafts are poorly revascularized in HD patients transplanted 9 and 12 years previously. To evaluate whether methodological issues relating to cell preparation may have an impact on graft viability, we implanted green fluorescent protein (GFP(+)) single-cell suspensions of fetal striatal neuronal cells into the striatum of YAC128 HD mice. Postmortem evaluation yielded comparable graft survival in YAC128 mice and their wild-type littermates (noncarrier) at 1 and 3 months posttransplantation. Additionally, the degrees of graft revascularization in the YAC128 and noncarrier mice were similar, with both capillaries and large-caliber vessels observable within the grafted tissue. Furthermore, GFP(+) cells interacted well with host blood vessels, indicating integration of the donor cells within the recipient brain. These observations, combined with our recent report of poor revascularization of solid grafts in the HD-transplanted patients, suggest that the success of cell transplantation can be improved by optimizing methodological aspects relating to cell preparation.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["GCisbani", "MSaint-Pierre", "FCicchetti"], "doi": "10.3727/096368913X668636"}

In the present study, we investigated the effects of reduced serum (to mimic a suppressed blood supply) on cell signaling events and the functional role of the calcium store in cultured, pterygial-derived fibroblasts.\nPure fibroblast cultures were established from cell outgrowths of pterygial tissue. Growth and migration of pterygial-derived fibroblast was evaluated using a patch growth assay, MTS assay, and a scratch wound assay. Intracellular calcium levels were determined using Fura-2 detection in response to ligand stimulation using a 96-well plate format.\nA progressive increase in serum concentration resulted in promotion of pterygial cell growth detected using the MTS assay. A significant increase in intracellular calcium level was observed in response to histamine (10 and 100 \u03bcM), ATP (10 and 100 \u03bcM), acetylcholine (10 and 100 \u03bcM) and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/mL) in serum-maintained cells.

{"title": "Expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) mRNA in healthy bone tissue around implants and in peri-implantitis.", "abstract": "Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory process involving peri-implant bone. Angiogenesis is critical for the development, remodeling and healing of bone. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a glycoprotein that induces endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis and capillary permeability. VEGF is expressed in a variety of highly vascularized tissues and seems to be a prerequisite for tumor growth and invasion. VEGF takes part in bone cell differentiation and by promoting angiogenesis at the site of bone formation. Aim of the present study was an evaluation of VEGF mRNA in bone around healthy and failing dental implants. Twenty patients participated in this study. Twenty bone biopsies were obtained, 10 at second-stage surgery from bone covering the healing screws (control), and 10 from implants presenting the typical signs and symptoms for peri-implantitis lesions (test). VEGF mRNA levels were not present in any of the controls, while it was identified in all tissues obtained from test implants. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Our results point to the fact that VEGF may be important in the regulation of tissue healing and bone remodeling in the peri-implantitis lesions because VEGF has been reported to play a role in the formation and attraction of osteoclasts, and osteoclasts have been shown to be a prominent feature of the peri-implantitis lesions.", "journal": "Minerva stomatologica", "date": "2013-06-13", "authors": ["LDi Alberti", "ARossetto", "MAlbanese", "AD'agostino", "DDe Santis", "DBertossi", "P FNocini"], "doi": "10.23736/S0026-4970.18.03640-3"}

Retinal astrocytes were suggested to be involved in retinal angiogenesis. This study aimed to describe their localization and cell density during the course of physiological vascularization and pathological revascularization. Mice expressing H2B-GFP (green fluorescent protein fused to histone 2B) from the endogenous Pdgfra promoter were kept in 75% oxygen from P7 (post natal day 7) to P12 (mouse model of OIR). Retinal flatmounts or cryosections were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap), glutamine synthetase (Glul), collagen IV (Col IV), desmin (Des), caspase 3 (Casp3), paired box 2 (Pax2), or Ki67. Astrocytic nuclei were counted with the ImageJ macro AuTOCellQuant. The hypoxic state of the retina was investigated by Hypoxyprobe. The GFP signal of the Pdgfra reporter mice co-localized with Pax2, a nuclear marker for retinal astrocytes. This bright label was much easier to quantify than Gfap or Pax2 staining. Quantification of the cell density of astrocytes during physiological development specified the spreading of astrocytes in a concentrical wave from the optic nerve head towards the periphery. Astrocyte density was reduced during the remodelling of the primary vascular plexus into a hierarchical vascular tree (maximal astrocyte density at P1: 2800 astrocytes/mm2, final astrocyte density: 800 astrocytes/mm2). In the OIR model, cell density of astrocytes was elevated in the peripheral vascularized zone. In contrast, astrocyte density dropped to a half (400 astrocytes/mm2) of the normal value in the central avascular zone during the hyperoxic phase between P8 and P10 by apoptosis and rose only after P17 as the retinal network normalized. An additional drop of astrocyte density was observed within the angles between the large vessels of the central avascular zone during hypoxia between P12 and P17. Astrocyte density was not altered at vascular tufts. The hyperoxia effect on astrocytes including the reduced astrocyte density is not the reason for vascular tuft formation.

Lots of kinase inhibitors have entered into market and show promising clinical benefits. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule, well-tolerated, orally active kinase inhibitor, R1498, majorly targeting both angiogenic and mitotic pathways for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastric cancer (GC). A series of biochemical and cell-based assays indicated that the target kinase cluster of R1498 included Aurora kinases and VEGFR2 et al. R1498 showed moderate in vitro growth inhibition on a panel of tumor cells with IC50 of micromole range. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of R1498 was evaluated on a panel of GC and HCC xenografts in a parallel comparison with another multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. R1498 demonstrated superior efficacy and toxicity profile over sorafenib in all test models with >80% tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression in some xenogratfts. The therapeutic potential of R1498 was also highlighted by its efficacy on three human GC primary tumor derived xenograft models with 10-30% tumor regression rate. R1498 was shown to actively inhibit the Aurora A activity in vivo, and decrease the vascularization in tumors. Furthermore, R1498 presented good in vivo exposure and therapeutic window in the pharmacokinetic and dose range finding studies.

Here, we summarized recent important findings of YKL-40 derived from cancerous cells and smooth muscle cells during tumor angiogenesis and development. YKL-40 is a potent angiogenic factor capable of stimulating tumor vascularization mediated by endothelial cells and maintaining vascular integrity supported by smooth muscle cells. In addition, YKL-40 induces FAK-MAPK signaling and up-regulates VEGF receptor 2 in endothelial cells; but a neutralizing antibody (mAY) against YKL-40 inhibits its angiogenic activity. While YKL-40 is essential for angiogenesis, little is known about its functional role in tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated tumor development. Therefore, significant efforts are urgently needed to identify pathophysiological function of YKL-40 in the dynamic interaction between tumor cells and TAMs in the tumor microenvironment, which may offer substantial mechanistic insights into tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and also point to a therapeutic target for treatment of cancers and other diseases.", "journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "date": "2013-06-12", "authors": ["RongShao"], "doi": "10.3389/fphys.2013.00122\n10.1083/jcb.200404171\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1317\n10.1146/annurev.biochem.68.1.729\n10.1002/path.1027\n10.1186/bcr3108\n10.1186/1742-2094-7-34\n10.1074/jbc.270.44.26252\n10.1200/JCO.2007.14.5375\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.09.005\n10.1016/j.clim.2011.04.007\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.05.038\n10.1016/j.ccr.2011.02.006\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199903)178:3<275::AID-JCP1>3.0.CO;2-Q\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690238\n10.1002/cncr.10644\n10.1038/nature01322\n10.1006/bbrc.2001.5253\n10.1097/PPO.0b013e3181eb33bc\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.021\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0868\n10.1136/gut.2010.207423\n10.1038/onc.2013.160\n10.1074/jbc.M110.212514\n10.1165/rcmb.2010-0080OC\n10.1074/jbc.M303137200\n10.1186/1476-4598-9-122\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1016/j.imbio.2011.11.003\n10.1002/ana.22360\n10.1074/jbc.271.32.19415\n10.1023/A:1024431000710\n10.2217/fon.09.66\n10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.11.011\n10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00026.x\n10.1038/onc.2011.498\n10.1186/1477-7819-5-17\n10.1002/ana.22220\n10.1080/00365540110080233\n10.1016/j.urolonc.2007.07.020\n10.1016/j.metabol.2011.09.004\n10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142250\n10.1016/j.coi.2008.10.002\n10.1084/jem.20081271\n10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200003)190:4<430::AID-PATH538>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4005\n10.1002/ijc.26379\n10.1006/excr.1999.4511\n10.1242/jcs.02970\n10.1186/ar3391\n10.1016/S0014-4827(03)00069-7\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.027\n10.1074/jbc.M110.103416\n10.1074/jbc.R000008200\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1765\n10.1371/journal.pone.0016032\n10.1016/j.diabres.2011.12.008\n10.1189/jlb.1211627\n10.3748/wjg.v17.i33.3830\n10.1038/nrc1256\n10.1242/jcs.058321\n10.1002/ijc.22881\n10.1007/s00011-006-0076-y\n10.1042/BJ20020075\n10.1006/geno.1997.4778\n10.1074/jbc.M306792200\n10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2510504.x\n10.1097/01.pai.0000213146.77772.6a\n10.1007/s10549-007-9870-7\n10.1002/ijc.23313\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025819\n10.1074/jbc.270.22.13076\n10.1038/bjc.2011.347\n10.1038/onc.2009.292\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0988\n10.1186/1471-2407-9-444\n10.1053/joca.2000.0377\n10.1002/stem.188\n10.1056/NEJMra0708126\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.9027"}

We show that endothelial cells initially enter the thymus at E13.5, with PDGFR-\u03b2(+) mesenchymal cells following at E14.5. Using an allelic series of the thymic epithelial cell (TEC) specific transcription factor Foxn1, we showed that these events are delayed by 1-2 days in Foxn1 (\u0394/\u0394) mice, and this phenotype was exacerbated with reduced Foxn1 dosage. At subsequent stages there were fewer capillaries, leaky blood vessels, disrupted endothelium - perivascular cell interactions, endothelial cell vacuolization, and an overall failure of vascular organization. The expression of both VEGF-A and PDGF-B, which are both primarily expressed in vasculature-associated mesenchyme or endothelium in the thymus, were reduced at E13.5 and E15.5 in Foxn1 (\u0394/\u0394) mice compared with controls. These data suggest that Foxn1 is required in TECs both to recruit endothelial cells and for endothelial cells to communicate with thymic mesenchyme, and for the differentiation of vascular-associated mesenchymal cells. These data show that Foxn1 function in TECs is required for normal thymus size and to generate the cellular and molecular environment needed for normal thymic vascularization.

{"title": "Tantalum rod implantation and vascularized iliac grafting for osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a progressive disease. Without operative intervention, it most often results in collapse and deterioration of the joint. Many joint-preserving surgeries have been implemented, but no uniform treatment exists. The authors report a modified technique of tantalum rod implantation combined with vascularized iliac grafting for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Fifty-two patients (56 hips) with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (Association Research Circulation Osseous classification stage II-IV) treated with this technique were retrospectively reviewed. The major steps of this technique included vascularized iliac graft harvested, necrotic lesion excised, and combined interventions implantation. All patients were followed for a mean of 60 months. Seven hips had to be converted to a total hip arthroplasty. The 5-year joint-preserving success rate of entire group was 87.5%, with 95% for Association Research Circulation Osseous stage II hips, 92% for Association Research Circulation Osseous stage III hips, and 63.6% for Association Research Circulation Osseous stage IV hips. The success rate was lower for stage IV hips compared with stage II and III hips. Mean Harris Hip score of the 49 hips improved significantly from 50 to 91 points. Forty-three (76.8%) of 56 hips remained stable on radiographs. The technique of tantalum rod implantation combined with vascularized iliac grafting may be an effective joint-preserving method for the treatment of intermediate-stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

{"title": "A facile method to fabricate hydrogels with microchannel-like porosity for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Hydrogels are widely used as three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering scaffolds due to their tissue-like water content, as well as their tunable physical and chemical properties. Hydrogel-based scaffolds are generally associated with nanoscale porosity, whereas macroporosity is highly desirable to facilitate nutrient transfer, vascularization, cell proliferation and matrix deposition. Diverse techniques have been developed for introducing macroporosity into hydrogel-based scaffolds. However, most of these methods involve harsh fabrication conditions that are not cell friendly, result in spherical pore structure, and are not amenable for dynamic pore formation. Human tissues contain abundant microchannel-like structures, such as microvascular network and nerve bundles, yet fabricating hydrogels containing microchannel-like pore structures remains a great challenge. To overcome these limitations, here we aim to develop a facile, cell-friendly method for engineering hydrogels with microchannel-like porosity using stimuli-responsive microfibers as porogens. Microfibers with sizes ranging 150-200 \u03bcm were fabricated using a coaxial flow of alginate and calcium chloride solution. Microfibers containing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were encapsulated within a 3D gelatin hydrogel, and then exposed to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution at varying doses and duration. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed effective dissolution of alginate microfibers after EDTA treatment, leaving well-defined, interconnected microchannel structures within the 3D hydrogels. Upon release from the alginate fibers, HEK cells showed high viability and enhanced colony formation along the luminal surfaces of the microchannels. In contrast, HEK cells in non-EDTA treated control exhibited isolated cells, which remained entrapped in alginate microfibers. Together, our results showed a facile, cell-friendly process for dynamic microchannel formation within hydrogels, which may simultaneously release cells in 3D hydrogels in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. This platform may be adapted to include other cell-friendly stimuli for porogen removal, such as Matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive peptides or photodegradable gels. While we used HEK cells in this study as proof of principle, the concept described in this study may also be used for releasing clinically relevant cell types, such as smooth muscle and endothelial cells that are useful for repairing tissues involving tubular structures.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Inhibition of angiogenesis: a novel antitumor mechanism of the herbal compound arctigenin.", "abstract": "Arctigenin, a functional ingredient of several traditional Chinese herbs, has been reported to have potential antitumor activity. However, its mechanisms of action are still not well elucidated. Because the establishment and metastatic spread of tumors is crucially dependent on angiogenesis, here we investigated whether arctigenin inhibits tumor growth by disturbing blood vessel formation. For this purpose, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to different arctigenin doses to study their viability, proliferation, protein expression, migration, and tube formation compared with vehicle-treated controls. In addition, arctigenin action on vascular sprouting was analyzed in an aortic ring assay. Furthermore, we studied direct arctigenin effects on CT26.WT colon carcinoma cells. Spheroids of these tumor cells were transplanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of arctigenin-treated and vehicle-treated BALB/c mice for the in-vivo analysis of tumor vascularization and growth by intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. We found that noncytotoxic doses of arctigenin dose dependently reduced the proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells without affecting their migratory and tube-forming capacity. Arctigenin treatment also resulted in a decreased cellular expression of phosphorylated serine/threonine protein kinase AKT, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen and inhibited vascular sprouting from aortic rings. In addition, proliferation, but not secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor, was decreased in arctigenin-treated tumor cells. Finally, arctigenin suppressed the vascularization and growth of engrafting CT26.WT tumors in the dorsal skinfold chamber model. Taken together, these results show for the first time an antiangiogenic action of arctigenin, which may contribute considerably toward its antitumor activity.", "journal": "Anti-cancer drugs", "date": "2013-06-08", "authors": ["YuanGu", "ClaudiaScheuer", "DiluFeng", "Michael DMenger", "Matthias WLaschke"], "doi": "10.1097/CAD.0b013e328362fb84"}

However, vascularization remains one of the main obstacles that must be overcome to reconstruct large bone defects. In vitro prevascularization of the three-dimensional (3-D) constructs using co-cultures of human progenitor-derived endothelial cells (PDECs) with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs) appeared as a potential strategy. However, the crosstalk between the two lineages has been studied in two-dimensional (2-D), but remains unknown in 3-D. The aim of this study is to investigate the cell interactions between PDECs and HBMSCs in a porous matrix composed of polysaccharides. This biodegradable scaffold promotes cell interactions by inducing multicellular aggregates composed of HBMSCs surrounded by PDECs. Cell aggregation contributes to the formation of junctional proteins composed of Connexin43 (Cx43) and VE-cadherin, and an activation of osteoblastic differentiation of HBMSCs stimulated by the presence of PDECs. Inhibition of Cx43 by mimetic peptide 43GAP27 induced a decrease in mRNA levels of Cx43 and all the bone-specific markers. Finally, subcutaneous implantations for 3 and 8 weeks in NOG mice revealed an increase in osteoid formation with the tissue-engineered constructs seeded with HBMSCs/PDECs compared with those loaded with HBMSCs alone.

High-frequency ultrasound (HFU, >20 MHz) is utilized to obtain high-resolution anatomical images of small animals while PAI provides high-contrast images of the vascular network. The imaging system is based on a 40 MHz, 5-element, 6 mm aperture annular-array transducer with a 800 \u03bcm diameter hole through its central element. The transducer was integrated in a cage-plate assembly allowing for a collimated laser beam to pass through the hole so that the optical and acoustic beams were collinear. The assembly was mounted on a two-axis, motorized stage to enable the simultaneous acquisition of co-registered HFU and PA volumetric data. Data were collected from all five elements in receive and a synthetic-focusing algorithm was applied in post-processing to beamform the data and increase the spatial resolution and depth-of-field (DOF) of the HFU and PA images. Phantom measurements showed that the system could achieve high-resolution images (down to 90 \u03bcm for HFU and 150 \u03bcm for PAI) and a large DOF of >8 mm.

The activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 family type 1 receptor that is expressed on both blood and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Its high-affinity ligand, bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), has been shown to be critical for retinal angiogenesis. The aim of this work was to investigate whether BMP9 could play a role in lymphatic development. We found that Bmp9 deficiency in mice causes abnormal lymphatic development. Bmp9-knockout (KO) pups presented hyperplastic mesenteric collecting vessels that maintained LYVE-1 expression. In accordance with this result, we found that BMP9 inhibited LYVE-1 expression in LECs in an ALK1-dependent manner. Bmp9-KO pups also presented a significant reduction in the number and in the maturation of mesenteric lymphatic valves at embryonic day 18.5 and at postnatal days 0 and 4. Interestingly, the expression of several genes known to be involved in valve formation (Foxc2, Connexin37, EphrinB2, and Neuropilin1) was upregulated by BMP9 in LECS. Finally, we demonstrated that Bmp9-KO neonates and adult mice had decreased lymphatic draining efficiency.

Loss of CDH1 is a trademark of the cellular event epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which increases the metastatic potential of malignant cells. PTEN is a tumor-suppressor gene commonly mutated in many human cancers, including endometrial cancer. In the mouse uterus, ablation of Pten induces epithelial hyperplasia, leading to endometrial carcinomas. However, loss of Pten alone does not affect longevity until around 5 mo. Similarly, conditional ablation of Cdh1 alone does not predispose mice to cancer. In this study, we characterized the impact of dual Cdh1 and Pten ablation (Cdh1(d/d) Pten(d/d)) in the mouse uterus. We observed that Cdh1(d/d) Pten(d/d) mice died at Postnatal Days 15-19 with massive blood loss. Their uteri were abnormally structured with curly horns, disorganized epithelial structure, and increased cell proliferation. Co-immunostaining of KRT8 and ACTA2 showed invasion of epithelial cells into the myometrium. Further, the uteri of Cdh1(d/d) Pten(d/d) mice had prevalent vascularization in both the endometrium and myometrium. We also observed reduced expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, loss of cell adherens, and tight junction molecules (CTNNB1 and claudin), as well as activation of AKT in the uteri of Cdh1(d/d) Pten(d/d) mice. However, complex hyperplasia was not found in the uteri of Cdh1(d/d) Pten(d/d) mice.

The retinal circulation, in particular, is supported by a central retinal artery branching into superficial arteries, which dive into the retina to form a dense network of capillaries in the deeper retinal layers. The function of the retina is highly dependent on the integrity and proper functioning of its vascular network and numerous ocular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinopathy of prematurity are caused by vascular abnormalities culminating in total and sometimes irreversible loss of vision. CCN1 and CCN2 are inducible extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins which play a major role in normal and aberrant formation of blood vessels as their expression is associated with developmental and pathological angiogenesis. Both CCN1 and CCN2 achieve disparate cell-type and context-dependent activities through modulation of the angiogenic and synthetic phenotype of vascular and mesenchymal cells respectively. At the molecular level, CCN1 and CCN2 may control capillary growth and vascular cell differentiation by altering the composition or function of the constitutive ECM proteins, potentiating or interfering with the activity of various ligands and/or their receptors, physically interfering with the ECM-cell surface interconnections, and/or reprogramming gene expression driving cells toward new phenotypes. As such, these proteins emerged as important prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in neovascular and fibrovascular diseases of the eye. The purpose of this review is to highlight our current knowledge and understanding of the most recent data linking CCN1 and CCN2 signaling to ocular neovascularization bolstering the potential value of targeting these proteins in a therapeutic context.", "journal": "Journal of cell communication and signaling", "date": "2013-06-07", "authors": ["LuluYan", "BrahimChaqour"], "doi": "10.1007/s12079-013-0206-6\n10.1007/s12079-012-0180-4\n10.1016/S0945-053X(03)00005-2\n10.1615/CritRevEukarGeneExpr.v21.i1.40\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81618-9\n10.1016/S0955-0674(02)00361-7\n10.1111/j.1365-2184.2004.00306.x\n10.1677/joe.0.1780169\n10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00332.x\n10.1167/iovs.10-6351\n10.1002/1097-4652(200009)184:3<301::AID-JCP3>3.0.CO;2-H\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2011.11.003\n10.1016/j.biocel.2008.07.025\n10.1074/jbc.M406813200\n10.1002/jcb.21194\n10.1074/jbc.M112.386565\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2003.08.001\n10.1073/pnas.0502935102\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012909\n10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.031\n10.1371/journal.pone.0009356\n10.1016/j.exer.2009.01.002\n10.1016/S1386-6346(03)00241-9\n10.1038/nm.2052\n10.1371/journal.pone.0030562\n10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03723.x\n10.1074/jbc.M109.019059\n10.1056/NEJMra1208129\n10.1074/jbc.M110.198689\n10.1001/archopht.121.9.1283\n10.1186/1471-213X-8-18\n10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01016.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000127952.90508.9D\n10.2337/diacare.27.3.758\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1997\n10.1007/s12079-009-0048-4\n10.1007/s00125-007-0621-4\n10.1038/nm877\n10.1242/dev.00505\n10.1165/rcmb.2005-0144OC\n10.1038/nrd3599\n10.1371/journal.pone.0031303\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.12.006\n10.2337/db06-0581\n10.1371/journal.pone.0002675\n10.1369/jhc.2008.950980\n10.1056/NEJMra0804630\n10.1242/jcs.03270\n10.1161/01.RES.0000257945.97958.77\n10.1074/jbc.M301009200\n10.1210/en.2007-1415\n10.1038/eye.2009.318\n10.1097/IAE.0b013e318275394a\n10.1007/s12079-009-0038-6\n10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2012.09.019\n10.1161/01.RES.0000248426.35019.89\n10.1128/MCB.22.24.8709-8720.2002\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.12.027\n10.1016/j.preteyeres.2012.04.001\n10.1165/rcmb.4692\n10.1002/jcb.20887\n10.1016/S1350-9462(01)00012-X\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61423-7\n10.1387/ijdb.041895ms\n10.1182/blood.V99.12.4457\n10.1097/00055735-200404000-00011\n10.1074/jbc.M105180200\n10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022414\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.203356\n10.1128/MCB.26.8.2955-2964.2006\n10.1016/j.exer.2009.02.007\n10.1210/en.142.5.1760\n10.1007/s12079-012-0178-y\n10.1146/annurev.biophys.35.040405.102013\n10.1042/0264-6021:3590089\n10.1080/08820530701745124\n10.1097/00006982-200510000-00015\n10.1002/jcb.23015\n10.1196/annals.1394.000\n10.1006/exer.2000.0844"}
{"title": "Is the renin-angiotensin system actually hypertensive?", "abstract": "The historical view of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is that of an endocrine hypertensive system that is controlled by renin and mediated via the action of angiotensin II on its type 1 receptor. Numerous new angiotensins (Ang) and receptors have been described, the majority being hypotensive and natriuretic, namely Ang-(1-7) and its receptor rMas. Renin and its precursor (pro-renin) can bind their common receptor. In addition to the production of Ang II, this receptor triggers intracellular effects. Given the control of renin production by intracellular calcium, calcium homeostasis is of particular importance. Ang-(1-12), which is not controlled by renin, is converted to several different angiotensin peptides and is a new pathway of the RAS. Local RAS enzymes produce or transform the different hyper- or hypotensive angiotensin within vessels and organs, but also in blood through circulating forms of the enzymes. In the kidney, a powerful local vascular RAS allows for the independence of renal vascularization from systemic control. Moreover, the kidney also contains an independent urinary RAS, which counterbalances the systemic RAS and coordinates proximal and distal sodium reabsorption. The systemic and local effects of renal RAS cannot be analyzed without taking into account the antagonistic effect of renalase. Our concept of RAS needs to evolve to take into account its dual potentiality (hyper- or hypotensive).", "journal": "Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2013-06-07", "authors": ["EtienneB\u00e9rard", "OlivierNiel", "AmandineRubio"], "doi": "10.1007/s00467-013-2481-0"}

A total of 240 newborn rats were randomly divided into a normoxia control (N) group, a hyperoxia (H) group and a H + FSD (HF) group. The rats were sacrificed, and the eyes were enucleated from postnatal day (P)12 to P21. Samples were prepared for retinal flat mounts, mRNA and protein quantification. On P14, a higher number of circuitous retinal veins was observed in the H group compared with the HF group. In the HF group, the avascular area was significantly reduced compared with the H group on P18 (P<0.01). In the HF group, the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased on P15 compared with the N and H group (P<0.01). On P15 and P17 in the H group and on P13 in the HF group, the mRNA expression of ICAM\u20111 was significantly increased compared with the other groups (P<0.05). In the H and HF group, the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was significantly increased on P12 compared with the N group (P<0.05). On P19 and P21, HIF-1\u03b1 expression was significantly increased to a maximum level in the HF group compared with the H and N group (P<0.01). In conclusion, these results suggest that FSD inhibits the expression of ICAM-1, assisting in the release of Bcl-2, suppressing caspase-3. In the HF group, the retinal flat mounts revealed that FSD had a vasorelaxant effect. On P18, a double-layered retinal vascular network was formed, and the number of non-perfused regions was significantly reduced. However, the late-phase peak expression of HIF-1\u03b1 resulted in an inevitable increase in vascular endothelial growth factor expression and further accelerated neovascularization and vascular reconstruction in the immature retinal model.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2013-06-07", "authors": ["HaiyingWang", "XiaolongChen"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2013.1410"}

Both types of cells were seeded on temperature-responsive culture dishes with PDLSCs alone, HUVECs alone and various ratios of the latter cells (1 : 1, 2 : 1, 5 : 1 and 1 : 5) to obtain confluent cell sheets. The expressions of osteo/odontogenic pathway markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), were analyzed at 3 and 7 d using RT-PCR. Further ALP protein quantification was performed at 7 and 14 d using ALP assay. The calcium nodule formation was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by alizarin red assay. Histological evaluations of three cell sheet constructs treated with different combinations (PDLSC-PDLSC-PDLSC/PDLSC-HUVEC-PDLSC/co-culture-co-culture-co-culture) were performed with hematoxylin and eosin and immunofluorescence staining. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test (p < 0.05).\nSignificantly higher ALP gene expression was observed at 3 d in 1 : 1 (PDLSC-HUVEC) (2.52 \u00b1 0.67) and 5 : 1 (4.05 \u00b1 1.07) co-culture groups compared with other groups (p < 0.05); this was consistent with ALP protein quantification. However, the expression of BSP and RUNX2 genes was higher at 7 d compared to 3 d. Significant calcium mineralization was detected as quantified by alizarin red assay at 14 d in 1 : 1 (1323.55 \u00b1 6.54 \u03bcm) and 5 : 1 (994.67 \u00b1 4.15 \u03bcm) co-cultures as compared with monoculture cell sheets (p < 0.05). Hematoxylin and eosin and CD31 immunostaining clearly exemplified the development of a layered cell sheet structure with endothelial cell islands within the constructed PDLSC-HUVEC-PDLSC and co-culture groups. Furthermore, HUVECs invaded the layered cell sheet, suggestive of rudimentary vascular network initiation.\nThis study suggests that the PDLSC-HUVEC co-culture, cell sheet, model exhibits significantly high levels of osteo/odontogenic markers with signs of initial vascular formation.

Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is the product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and the substrate for O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) modification. This modification affects a wide range of proteins by altering their activity, cellular localization, and/or protein interactions. However, the role O-GlcNAcylation may play in normal postnatal retinal vascular development and in the ocular complications of diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, requires further investigation.\nThe total levels of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis of lysates prepared from retinas obtained at different days during postnatal retinal vascularization and oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy. Similar experiments were performed with retinal lysate prepared from diabetic Ins2(Akita/+) mice with different durations of diabetes and retinal vascular cells cultured under various glucose conditions. The localization of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in the retinal vasculature was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. The impact of altered O-GlcNAcylation on the migration of retinal vascular cells was determined using scratch wound and transwell migration assays.\nWe detected an increase in protein O-GlcNAcylation during mouse postnatal retinal vascularization and aging, in part through the regulation of the enzymes that control this modification. The study of the diabetic Ins2(Akita/+) mouse retina showed an increase in the O-GlcNAc modification of retinal proteins. We also observed an increase in retinal O-GlcNAcylated protein levels during the neovascularization phase of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy. Our fluorescence microscopy data confirmed that the alterations in retinal O-GlcNAcylation are similarly represented in the retinal vasculature and in retinal pericytes and endothelial cells. Particularly, the migration of retinal pericytes, but not retinal endothelial cells, was attenuated by increased O-GlcNAc modification.\nThe O-GlcNAc modification pattern changes during postnatal retinal vascular development and neovascularization, and its dysregulation under hyperglycemia and/or ischemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of the diabetic retinopathy and retinal neovascularization.", "journal": "Molecular vision", "date": "2013-06-05", "authors": ["ZaferGurel", "Kelsey MSieg", "Keegan DShallow", "Christine MSorenson", "NaderSheibani"], "doi": null}

Two types of scaffolds with complementary porous structures were fabricated by spherulite-accumulating and porogen-preparing methods, and were named spherulite HA-positive and porogen HA-negative, respectively. After implantation for 1 month, histological observation showed that all the scaffolds were encapsulated by normal muscle tissue and multiple vascular net with cells, indicating excellent biocompatibility and pore interconnectivity of the scaffolds. In the spherulite HA-positive scaffolds, a number of osteoclasts and osteoblasts coupled with new bone tissues were found after 3 and 6 months' implantations, which was better than those in the porogen HA-negative scaffolds. Similarly, the improvement of mechanical properties and the reconstruction of materials in the spherulite HA-positive scaffolds were superior to those in the porogen HA-negative scaffolds.

{"title": "Ovarian tumor attachment, invasion, and vascularization reflect unique microenvironments in the peritoneum: insights from xenograft and mathematical models.", "abstract": "Ovarian cancer relapse is often characterized by metastatic spread throughout the peritoneal cavity with tumors attached to multiple organs. In this study, interaction of ovarian cancer cells with the peritoneal tumor microenvironment was evaluated in a xenograft model based on intraperitoneal injection of fluorescent SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells. Intra-vital microscopy of mixed GFP-red fluorescent protein (RFP) cell populations injected into the peritoneum demonstrated that cancer cells aggregate and attach as mixed spheroids, emphasizing the importance of homotypic adhesion in tumor formation. Electron microscopy provided high resolution structural information about local attachment sites. Experimental measurements from the mouse model were used to build a three-dimensional cellular Potts ovarian tumor model (OvTM) that examines ovarian cancer cell attachment, chemotaxis, growth, and vascularization. OvTM simulations provide insight into the relative influence of cancer cell-cell adhesion, oxygen availability, and local architecture on tumor growth and morphology. Notably, tumors on the mesentery, omentum, or spleen readily invade the \"open\" architecture, while tumors attached to the gut encounter barriers that restrict invasion and instead rapidly expand into the peritoneal space. Simulations suggest that rapid neovascularization of SKOV3.ip1 tumors is triggered by constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia. This research highlights the importance of cellular adhesion and tumor microenvironment in the seeding of secondary ovarian tumors on diverse organs within the peritoneal cavity. Results of the OvTM simulations indicate that invasion is strongly influenced by features underlying the mesothelial lining at different sites, but is also affected by local production of chemotactic factors.

{"title": "Ectopic bone formation in severely combat-injured orthopedic patients -- a hematopoietic niche.", "abstract": "Combat-related heterotopic ossification (HO) has emerged as a common and problematic complication of modern wartime extremity injuries, contributing to substantial patient morbidity and loss of function. We have previously reported that HO-forming patients exhibit a more pronounced systemic and local inflammatory response very early in the wound healing process. Moreover, traumatized muscle-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells from these patients have a skewed differentiation potential toward bone. Here, we demonstrate that HO lesions excised from this patient population contain highly vascularized, mature, cancellous bone containing adipogenic marrow. Histologic analysis showed immature hematopoietic cells located within distinct foci in perivascular regions. The adipogenic marrow often contained low numbers of functional erythroid (BFU-E), myeloid (CFU-GM, CFU-M) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) colony-forming hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Conversely, tissue from control muscle and non-HO traumatic wound granulation tissue showed no evidence of hematopoietic progenitor cell activity. In summary, our findings suggest that ectopic bone can provide an appropriate hematopoietic microenvironment for supporting the proliferation and differentiation of HPCs. This reactive and vibrant cell population may help maintain normal hematopoietic function, particularly in those with major extremity amputations who have sustained both massive blood loss, prompting systemic marrow stimulation, as well as loss of available native active marrow space. These findings begin to characterize the functional biology of ectopic bone and elucidate the interactions between HPC and non-hematopoietic cell types within the ectopic intramedullary hematopoietic microenvironmental niche identified.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2013-06-04", "authors": ["Thomas ADavis", "YelenaLazdun", "Benjamin KPotter", "Jonathan AForsberg"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2013.05.016"}
{"title": "[Atlas of skin perforator arteries of trunk and limbs - guide in the realization of perforator flaps].", "abstract": "Since Harvey, anatomists and surgeons have developed better knowledge of skin vascularization. Descriptive anatomy evolved from the direct and indirect cutaneous arteries concept to that of skin perforator arteries. These skin perforator arteries have preferential locations or clusters. An atlas of skin perforator arteries allows identifying these clusters in relation to anatomical landmarks.\nA literature review was undertaken in order to find the characteristics of perforator arteries originating in the source arteries described by Taylor. This research allowed us to uncover 895 citations. We have selected from this abundant literature source only the articles that specifically treated the perforator arteries localization. All the data concerning the perforator arteries localization, their source artery, the caliber and territory, were analyzed and recorded. We described the perforators that were covered most frequently.\nThe definition of these clusters is based on a work of collecting and synthesizing of anatomical, radiological and clinical data. The preferential territories or clusters of skin perforators were defined using simple anatomical landmarks. A synthesized iconography was imagined to allow easy and fast usage of the atlas.\nThis atlas is a learning tool that helps realizing locoregional or free perforator flaps. It can form a \"winning duo\" with the acoustic Doppler in preoperatory design of a perforator flap. This duo is easily available, portable, easy to use, non-invasive and inexpensive. In conclusion, the precise localization of perforator arteries associated to adherence to the big principles and definitions of the perforator flaps will allow users to better understand the surface and orientation of the skin paddle that can be taken on one perforator artery.", "journal": "Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique", "date": "2013-06-04", "authors": ["FBoucher", "AMojallal"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anplas.2013.04.004"}

Animals were killed either 3 or 12\u00a0months after surgery. Explanted knees were processed for histology (n\u00a0= 10) or mechanical tests including tests of laxity and loading to failure in tension (n\u00a0= 15).\nWell-vascularized tissue ingrowth within the artificial ligament was only observed in the portions of the ligament in contact with the host's tissues (native ligament and bone tunnels). Ligament wear was observed in 40% of explanted knees. The ultimate tensile failure loads of the operated knees at both time points were inferior to those of the contralateral, intact knees (144 \u00b1 69 N at 3 months and 260 \u00b1 126 N at 12 months versus 1,241 \u00b1 270 N and 1,218 \u00b1 189 N, respectively) (P < .01). In specimens with intact artificial ligaments, failure occurred by slippage from the bone tunnels in all specimens explanted 3 months postoperatively and in half of the specimens explanted 12 months postoperatively.\nThis study provides evidence that the LARS AC has a satisfactory biointegration but that it is not suitable for ACL replacement if uniform tissue ingrowth is contemplated. Despite good clinical performance up to 1 year after implantation, none of the reconstructions approached the mechanical performance of the normal ACL in the ovine model. Partial tearing of the artificial ligament, which led to a significant decrease in ultimate tensile strength, was observed in 40% of cases in the ovine model.\nThe LARS is not a suitable scaffold for ACL replacement.

{"title": "Intravenous contrast-enhanced sonography in children and adolescents - a single center experience.", "abstract": "Compared to adult patients, ultrasonography in children and adolescents is much more common, due to lack of ionizing radiation, and its wide availability. With the introduction of contrast-media for use in ultrasonography, one major drawback of the method could be overcome. In Europe, SonoVue(\u00ae) is the only widely available agent, which due to improved stability makes it possible to image normal and diseased tissue perfusion and vascularization with high accuracy. Inability to hold the breath and voluntary body movement of the patient is less of an obstacle compared to color Doppler techniques and makes the method very attractive for use in children, which, depending on age, may not be very cooperative. Use of intravenous contrast-medium in minors is currently very limited for several reasons: availability, lack of recommendation in national and international guidelines, and lack of official licensing. The article will touch medical indications, technique, safety considerations, and perspective of intravenous use of contrast-media in children and adolescents, including data from a 6-year period in 37 patients.\nThe purpose of the study was to collect data on ultrasonographic examinations, expanded by intravenous administration of the contrast agent SonoVue(\u00ae) in children and adolescents. Besides assessing diagnostic yield, data on adverse medication effects was collected.\nThe study includes contrast-enhanced ultrasound examinations in 37 children at a single institution. Indications for the examinations were tumor lesions, infections, traumatic organ injuries, and parenchymal organ ischemia. Parents of the patients and adolescent patients were informed about the off-label use of the contrast agent. Thirty-nine examinations were performed, the average age of the patient was 11.1 years (range 1 to 17 years).\nAll of the examinations yielded additional diagnostic value, always expanding results from B mode and color coded sonography. Overall, most examinations were done to assess the liver (n=16), followed by the kidney in 10 cases. The different etiologies were encountered in the following order: tumor (n=22), infection (n=9), trauma (n=5), ischemia (n=4). Most examinations were performed to evaluate a hepatic lesion (n=12). There was one incident recorded that fit the criteria of a possible adverse effect. In an 8-year-old girl nausea was noted, that started 15 minutes after the end of the examination and resolved spontaneously. In none of the patients medical treatment for adverse effects was necessary.\nUltrasonography in children, enhanced by intravenous use of contrast medium is feasible and allows for further evaluating cystic and solid tumors, and organ perfusion. Given that proper medical equipment and correct ultrasound machine settings are used, it is a robust method without diagnostic failures. In this small-sized case series there were no severe adverse effects, however, off-label use in children needs to be addressed.\nBadania ultrasonograficzne s\u0105 wykonywane w populacji pediatrycznej znacznie cz\u0119\u015bciej ni\u017c u os\u00f3b doros\u0142ych.

{"title": "Effects of cell grafting on coronary remodeling after myocardial infarction.", "abstract": "With recent advances in therapeutic applications of stem cells, cell engraftment has become a promising therapy for replacing injured myocardium after infarction. The survival and function of injected cells, however, will depend on the efficient vascularization of the new tissue. Here we describe the arteriogenic remodeling of the coronary vessels that supports vascularization of engrafted tissue postmyocardial infarction (post-MI).\nFollowing MI, murine hearts were injected with a skeletal myoblast cell line previously shown to develop into large grafts. Microcomputed tomography at 28 days postengraftment revealed the 3-dimensional structure of the newly formed conducting vessels. The grafts elicited both an angiogenic response and arteriogenic remodeling of the coronary arteries to perfuse the graft. The coronaries upstream of the graft also remodeled, showing an increase in branching, and a decrease in vascular density. Histological analysis revealed the presence of capillaries as well as larger vascular lumens within the graft. Some graft vessels were encoated by smooth muscle \u03b1-actin positive cells, implying that vascular remodeling occurs at both the conducting arterial and microvascular levels.\nFollowing MI and skeletal myoblast engraftment, the murine coronary vessels exhibit plasticity that enables both arteriogenic remodeling of the preexisting small branches of the coronary arteries and development of large and small smooth muscle encoated vessels within the graft.

{"title": "A microfluidic platform for generating large-scale nearly identical human microphysiological vascularized tissue arrays.", "abstract": "This paper reports a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic model system that can develop an array of nearly identical human microtissues with interconnected vascular networks. The microfluidic system design is based on an analogy with an electric circuit, applying resistive circuit concepts to design pressure dividers in serially-connected microtissue chambers. A long microchannel (550, 620 and 775 mm) creates a resistive circuit with a large hydraulic resistance. Two media reservoirs with a large cross-sectional area and of different heights are connected to the entrance and exit of the long microchannel to serve as a pressure source, and create a near constant pressure drop along the long microchannel. Microtissue chambers (0.12 \u03bcl) serve as a two-terminal resistive component with an input impedance >50-fold larger than the long microchannel. Connecting each microtissue chamber to two different positions along the long microchannel creates a series of pressure dividers. Each microtissue chamber enables a controlled pressure drop of a segment of the microchannel without altering the hydrodynamic behaviour of the microchannel. The result is a controlled and predictable microphysiological environment within the microchamber. Interstitial flow, a mechanical cue for stimulating vasculogenesis, was verified by finite element simulation and experiments. The simplicity of this design enabled the development of multiple microtissue arrays (5, 12, and 30 microtissues) by co-culturing endothelial cells, stromal cells, and fibrin within the microchambers over two and three week periods. This methodology enables the culturing of a large array of microtissues with interconnected vascular networks for biological studies and applications such as drug development.", "journal": "Lab on a chip", "date": "2013-06-01", "authors": ["Yu-HsiangHsu", "Monica LMoya", "Christopher C WHughes", "Steven CGeorge", "Abraham PLee"], "doi": "10.1039/c3lc50424g"}

For hs-3DCG, the necessary preoperative radiographic images were fused. A hybrid model of volume and surface rendering was created from the fused images. The simulation results were compared with the operative results, and the MVA estimation rate was compared between VOF and contrast-enhanced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition.\nBy using VOF, the point at which the main feeder penetrated the tumor was estimated in all cases, and using this information, the MVA was detected. All patients underwent resection of the main feeder in the same way as simulated preoperatively. Estimation rates of MVA were 37.5% in CE-FIESTA and 100% in VOF (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test).\nThe hs-3DCG method was of sufficiently high quality to enable VOF of CPA meningioma.

After 6 cycles, patients on the fosbretabulin arm without progression could continue to receive fosbretabulin on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week schedule until progression. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\nEighty patients were assigned (planned, 180) when enrollment was stopped due to rarity of disease and very low accrual. Median OS was 5.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1, 9.0] for the CP/fosbretabulin arm (n=55; hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.44, 1.21]) and 4.0 months [95% CI 2.8, 6.2] for the CP arm (n=25; p=0.22 [log rank test]). One-year survival for CP/fosbretabulin versus CP was 26% versus 9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in progression-free survival between the two arms. Grade 1-2 hypertension and grade 3-4 neutropenia were more common with CP/fosbretabulin. There were no significant adverse cardiovascular side effects.\nAlthough the study did not meet statistical significance in improvement in OS with the addition of fosbretabulin to carboplatin/paclitaxel, it represents the largest prospective randomized trial ever conducted in ATC.

{"title": "Loss of Pten promotes angiogenesis and enhanced vegfaa expression in zebrafish.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the emergence of vessels from an existing vascular network, is pathologically associated with tumor progression and is of great interest for therapeutic intervention. PTEN is a frequently mutated tumor suppressor and has been linked to the progression of many types of tumors, including hemangiosarcomas in zebrafish. Here, we report that mutant zebrafish embryos lacking functional Pten exhibit enhanced angiogenesis, accompanied by elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt). Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by LY294002 treatment and application of sunitinib, a widely used anti-angiogenic compound, suppressed enhanced angiogenesis in Pten mutants. Vegfaa has a crucial role in angiogenesis and vegfaa expression was upregulated in embryos lacking functional Pten. Interestingly, vegfaa expression was also upregulated in hemangiosarcomas from haploinsufficient adult zebrafish Pten mutants. Elevated vegfaa expression in mutant embryos lacking functional Pten was suppressed by LY294002. Surprisingly, sunitinib treatment dramatically enhanced vegfaa expression in Pten mutant embryos, which might account for tumor relapse in human patients who are treated with sunitinib. Combined treatment with suboptimal concentrations of sunitinib and LY294002 rescued enhanced angiogenesis in pten mutant embryos without the dramatic increase in vegfaa expression, suggesting a new approach for therapeutic intervention in VEGFR-signaling-dependent tumors.", "journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "date": "2013-05-31", "authors": ["SumaChoorapoikayil", "BartWeijts", "RianneKers", "Alainde Bruin", "Jeroenden Hertog"], "doi": "10.1242/dmm.012377"}

With the growing interest in regenerative medicine, approaches to supplement fat grafts with adipose-derived stem cells are evolving in hopes of promoting vascularization and neoadipogenesis.\nThe authors evaluated the outcomes of the most common processing techniques for fat grafting--decantation, washing, high-speed centrifugation--and stromal vascular cell-supplemented lipotransfer to determine which method yields a higher percentage of retention and better quality graft.\nA total of 32 subcutaneous injections of processed human lipoaspirate were carried out in 8 athymic rats. Each animal received all 4 processing conditions, with end points at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postinjection. Evaluation of graft survival included serial measurements of volume retention and histologic analysis.\nAt 12 weeks postinjection, cell-supplemented and centrifuged grafts showed the most consistent volume maintenance. Based on histologic analysis, cell-supplemented and washed grafts had higher scores of viability and vascularity, with the former presenting the least cystic necrosis and calcification as well as minimal inflammation.\nCell-supplemented lipotransfer had optimal outcomes for graft retention, viability, and vascularity, while washing resulted in high viability with a less intensive process.

In this study, we explore the effects of in vitro induced donor antigen-specific CD4(-) CD8(-) double negative (DN) Treg-based therapy, in a fully MHC mismatched mouse VCA such as a vascularized osteomyocutaneous as compared to a non-VCA such as a full thickness skin (FTS) transplantation model to elucidate the unique features of VCA rejection and tolerance. We demonstrate that combined therapy with antigen-induced CD4 derived DN Tregs and a short course of anti-lymphocyte serum, rapamycin and IL-2/Fc fusion protein results in donor-specific tolerance to VCA, but not FTS allografts. Macrochimerism was detected in VCA but not FTS allograft recipients up to >60 days after transplantation.

Compared to porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), the effect of these matrices on the regenerative capacity of blood vessels is still not ideal. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) can more effectively transport VEGF to cells or tissues because of their large specific surface area and interior cavity. In this study, we explored the safety and efficacy of implanted VEGF-loaded MWNT composite scaffolds in vitro and vivo to repair abdominal wall defects.\nVEGF-loaded MWNTs were prepared by a modified plasma polymerization treatment. Four composite scaffolds were evaluated for cytotoxicity, proliferation, and release dynamics. We created 3 cm\u00d74 cm abdominal wall defects in 43 Sprague-Dawley rats. After implantation times of 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, the scaffolds and the surrounding tissues were collected and examined by gross inspection, biomechanical testing, and histological examination.\nA 5-10 nm poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) film was evenly distributed on MWNTs. The 3% MWNT composite group showed lower cytotoxicity and appropriate release performance, and it was thus tested in vivo. In rats with the 3% composite implanted, host cells were prevented from migrating to the ADM at 2 weeks, vascularization was established more rapidly at 12 weeks, and the values for both the maximum load and the elastic modulus were significantly lower than in the ADM-alone group (p<0.01). Histological staining revealed that the MWNT was still not completely eliminated 12 weeks after implantation.\nMWNTs were able to carry VEGF to cells or tissues, and the 3% MWNT composite material showed lower cytotoxicity and had an appropriate release performance, which prompted faster vascularization of the ADM than other scaffolds.

In a large Dutch FEVR family, we performed linkage analysis, exome sequencing, and segregation analysis of DNA variants. We identified putative disease-causing DNA variants in proline-alanine-rich ste20-related kinase (c.791dup; p.Ser265ValfsX64) and zinc finger protein 408 (ZNF408) (c.1363C>T; p.His455Tyr), the latter of which was also present in an additional Dutch FEVR family that subsequently appeared to share a common ancestor with the original family. Sequence analysis of ZNF408 in 132 additional individuals with FEVR revealed another potentially pathogenic missense variant, p.Ser126Asn, in a Japanese family. Immunolocalization studies in COS-1 cells transfected with constructs encoding the WT and mutant ZNF408 proteins, revealed that the WT and the p.Ser126Asn mutant protein show complete nuclear localization, whereas the p.His455Tyr mutant protein was localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Moreover, in a cotransfection assay, the p.His455Tyr mutant protein retains the WT ZNF408 protein in the cytoplasm, suggesting that this mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion. Finally, morpholino-induced knockdown of znf408 in zebrafish revealed defects in developing retinal and trunk vasculature, that could be rescued by coinjection of RNA encoding human WT ZNF408 but not p.His455Tyr mutant ZNF408.

{"title": "Specification of chondrocytes and cartilage tissues from embryonic stem cells.", "abstract": "Osteoarthritis primarily affects the articular cartilage of synovial joints. Cell and/or cartilage replacement is a promising therapy, provided there is access to appropriate tissue and sufficient numbers of articular chondrocytes. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent a potentially unlimited source of chondrocytes and tissues as they can generate a broad spectrum of cell types under appropriate conditions in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that mouse ESC-derived chondrogenic mesoderm arises from a Flk-1(-)/Pdgfr\u03b1(+) (F(-)P(+)) population that emerges in a defined temporal pattern following the development of an early cardiogenic F(-)P(+) population. Specification of the late-arising F(-)P(+) population with BMP4 generated a highly enriched population of chondrocytes expressing genes associated with growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes. By contrast, specification with Gdf5, together with inhibition of hedgehog and BMP signaling pathways, generated a population of non-hypertrophic chondrocytes that displayed properties of articular chondrocytes. The two chondrocyte populations retained their hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic properties when induced to generate spatially organized proteoglycan-rich cartilage-like tissue in vitro. Transplantation of either type of chondrocyte, or tissue generated from them, into immunodeficient recipients resulted in the development of cartilage tissue and bone within an 8-week period. Significant ossification was not observed when the tissue was transplanted into osteoblast-depleted mice or into diffusion chambers that prevent vascularization. Thus, through stage-specific manipulation of appropriate signaling pathways it is possible to efficiently and reproducibly derive hypertrophic and non-hypertrophic chondrocyte populations from mouse ESCs that are able to generate distinct cartilage-like tissue in vitro and maintain a cartilage tissue phenotype within an avascular and/or osteoblast-free niche in vivo.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2013-05-30", "authors": ["April MCraft", "NazishAhmed", "Jason SRockel", "Gurpreet SBaht", "Benjamin AAlman", "Rita AKandel", "Agamemnon EGrigoriadis", "Gordon MKeller"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.087890"}

{"title": "Epiphyseal growth plate growth hormone receptor signaling is decreased in chronic kidney disease-related growth retardation.", "abstract": "Linear growth retardation in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been ascribed to insensitivity to growth hormone. This resistance state has been attributed to impaired growth hormone signaling through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in liver and skeletal muscle leading to reduced insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Here we determine whether systemic and growth plate alterations in growth hormone signaling contribute to CKD-induced linear growth retardation using partially nephrectomized and pair-fed control 20-day-old rats. Serum growth hormone did not change in rats with CKD, yet serum IGF-I levels were decreased and growth retarded. The tibial growth plate hypertrophic zone was wider and vascularization at the primary ossification center was reduced in CKD. This was associated with a decrease in growth plate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and immunostainable VEGF and IGF-I levels. Growth plate growth hormone receptor and STAT5 protein levels were unchanged, while JAK2 was reduced. Despite comparable growth hormone and growth hormone receptor levels in CKD and control rats, relative STAT5 phosphorylation was significantly depressed in CKD. Of note, the mRNA of SOCS2, an inhibitor of growth hormone signaling, was increased. Thus, linear growth impairment in CKD can in part be explained by impaired long bone growth plate growth hormone receptor signaling through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, an abnormality that may be caused by an increase in SOCS2 expression.", "journal": "Kidney international", "date": "2013-05-30", "authors": ["ArielTroib", "DanielLandau", "LeonidKachko", "RalphRabkin", "YaelSegev"], "doi": "10.1038/ki.2013.196"}

{"title": "Intraoral microvascular anastomosis for segmental mandibular reconstruction following removal of an ameloblastoma.", "abstract": "Cases of immediate bony microvascular reconstruction following segmental mandibulectomy in children are hard to find in the current literature. Moreover, microvascular segmental mandibular reconstruction that adopts an intraoral anastomosis technique has not been described so far. Therefore, the present clinical report aims at extending the armamentarium of bony microvascular reconstruction in pediatric cases of segmental mandibulectomy by highlighting an intraoral microvascular anastomosing technique.A 6-year-old boy, who suffered from an ameloblastoma of the mural type in the mandible, received a radical segmental mandibular resection because of the high recurrence rate of this tumor entity. Immediate reconstruction was carried out with a fibular double-barrel graft. Microvascular anastomoses were performed in an end-to-end fashion with the facial artery and vein as recipient vessels. The postoperative course was uneventful. There was no impairment of speech, deglutition, mastication, and facial nerve function. The facial appearance remained unobtrusive. On removal of the reconstruction plate 3 months after the reconstruction procedure, bleeding from the reconstructed mandibular segment indicated vascularization of the graft.It seems that segmental mandibulectomy and simultaneous microvascular bony reconstruction do not necessarily lead to impaired function as far as speech, deglutition, and mastication are concerned. Instead, the intraoral anastomosis technique allows waiving extraoral skin incisions and subsequent scarring, leaving the facial appearance unchanged and unobtrusive. Especially, the potential risk of stigmatization of the patient is avoided.

{"title": "The use of self-inflating soft tissue expanders prior to bone augmentation of atrophied alveolar ridges.", "abstract": "Extensive bone augmentation procedures are frequently performed prior to implant surgery. To achieve tension-free wound closure at the grafted site and thus avoid dehiscence and exposure or total loss of the bone graft, extensive soft tissue mobilization is required. In vitro studies have shown the potential of self-filling osmotic tissue expanders to optimize the amount of resulting soft tissue and vascularization of the recipient site.\nThe purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the application and complication rate of osmotic hydrogel expanders inserted subperiosteally prior to bone grafting.\nIn this prospective observational study, eight patients were implanted with 11 intraoral osmotic hydrogel expanders prior to bone augmentation procedures. All expanders were placed in subperiosteal positions using the tunnel technique. The occurrence of soft tissue-related complications such as necrosis, perforation, infection, or wound dehiscence leading to expander loss was defined as the primary parameter for analysis and evaluation. Further clinical parameters were soft tissue quality and quantity as well as expansion duration.\nThe expansion time depended upon defect size and expander dimensions. Complications, that is, perforation of the expanders through the oral mucosa, occurred in two patients (3 expanders) who suffered from extreme preoperative scarring in the treated areas owing to prior trauma in one patient and cleft surgery in the other. Patients were grafted with autologous (n\u2009=\u20097) or synthetic (n\u2009=\u20091) block grafts. The expanders were removed during bone grafting surgery. No further dehiscence occurred during the observation period, and all patients were treated successfully with dental implants and subsequent prosthetic reconstruction.\nWithin the limits of this observational clinical study, hydrogel expanders may help to generate additional soft tissue, and they might contribute to the overall improvement of the bone augmentation process by reducing the risk of complications related to the lack of soft tissue.

{"title": "Surgical rehabilitation following ocular chemical injury.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the management of limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) secondary to chemical ocular burns.\nThe charts of 48 eyes of 40 patients with grade 2 or higher chemical injury were evaluated retrospectively. Subjects with follow-up longer than 1 year were included. Medical treatment, surgical correction of abnormalities of ocular adnexial structures, limbal stem cell transplantation from patient's fellow eye, from living relatives or from cadaveric donor, amniotic membrane transplantation, conjunctival epitheliectomy, chelation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and penetrating keratoplasty were the treatment modalities. Outcome measures were ocular surface stability and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). Failure was defined as the appearance of persistent epithelial defect (nonhealing epithelial defect for more than 2 weeks) with progressive corneal conjunctivalization/vascularization and thinning, and also progression of conjunctivalization to the central 6\u2009mm of the cornea in eyes with subsequent keratoplasty.\nThe mean age of 31 male and 9 female patients were 32.32\u2009\u00b1\u200912.6 years.

{"title": "Co-culture of adipose-derived stem cells and endothelial cells in fibrin induces angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in a chorioallantoic membrane model.", "abstract": "Neovascularization of adipose tissue equivalents is a crucial step in successful adipose tissue engineering, since insufficient vascularization results in graft resorption in an in vivo situation. A possible cellular approach to overcome this limitation is the co-implantation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) with endothelial cells to stimulate the formation of a vascular network. We investigated the potential of ASCs derived from human abdominal fat tissue co-cultured with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from human peripheral blood to stimulate neovascularization of fibrin constructs on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of fertilized chicken eggs, in direct comparison to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). After 9\u2009days of incubation, cell-fibrin constructs were explanted and histologically evaluated with respect to ingrowth of avian blood vessels into the construct and formation of human blood vessels by co-implanted endothelial cells. When administered on the CAM, ASCs successfully guided host vasculature into the construct (angiogenesis) and guided formation of capillary-like structures by co-implanted human endothelial cells (vasculogenesis), with HUVECs being superior to EPCs, leading to a perfused avian and human capillary network within the fibrin construct. However, the results also showed that perfused human blood vessels were only observed near the CAM compared to unperfused capillary-like structures near the top of the construct, indicating that perfusion of the cell-fibrin construct takes longer than 9\u2009days. In conclusion, as blood vessel formation is an essential step during adipogenic differentiation, the data support our hypothesis that cellular communication between transplanted ASCs and endothelial cells is beneficial for vasculogenesis.

{"title": "Influence of soluble or matrix-bound isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor-A on tumor response to vascular-targeted strategies.", "abstract": "Antiangiogenic therapy based on blocking the actions of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) can lead to \"normalization\" of blood vessels in both animal and human tumors. Differential expression of VEGF isoforms affects tumor vascular maturity, which could influence the normalization process and response to subsequent treatment. Fibrosarcoma cells expressing only VEGF120 or VEGF188 isoforms were implanted either subcutaneously (s.c.) or in dorsal skin-fold \"window\" chambers in SCID mice. VEGF120 was associated with vascular fragility and hemorrhage. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with repeat doses of SU5416, an indolinone receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against VEGFR-2 and proven preclinical ability to induce tumor vascular normalization. SU5416 reduced vascularization in s.c. implants of both VEGF120 and VEGF188 tumors. However, in the window chamber, SU5416 treatment increased red cell velocity in VEGF120 (representing vascular normalization) but not VEGF188 tumors. SU5416 treatment had no effect on growth or necrosis levels in either tumor type but tended to counteract the increase in interstitial fluid pressure seen with growth of VEGF120 tumors. SU5416 pretreatment resulted in the normally fragile blood vessels in VEGF120-expressing tumors becoming resistant to the vascular damaging effects of the tubulin-binding vascular disrupting agent (VDA), combretastatin A4 3-O-phosphate (CA4P). Thus, vascular normalization induced by antiangiogenic treatment can reduce the efficacy of subsequent VDA treatment. Expression of VEGF120 made tumors particularly susceptible to vascular normalization by SU5416, which in turn made them resistant to CA4P. Therefore, VEGF isoform expression may be useful for predicting response to both antiangiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapy.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2013-05-29", "authors": ["SimonAkerman", "MatthewFisher", "Rachel ADaniel", "DianeLefley", "Constantino CReyes-Aldasoro", "Sarah JaneLunt", "SheilaHarris", "MeitBjorndahl", "Leigh JWilliams", "HelenEvans", "Paul RBarber", "Vivien EPrise", "BorivojVojnovic", "ChrysoKanthou", "Gillian MTozer"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.28281"}

{"title": "Mast cell isolation from the immature rat brain.", "abstract": "Mast cells are immune cells of hematopoietic origin that circulate as precursor cells prior to migration into vascularized tissues where they mature and undergo terminal differentiation in response to different cytokines within the local environment. Mast cells are well known as important regulators of inflammatory processes in peripheral tissues and recent studies support the involvement of mast cells in mediating the inflammatory response to cerebral hypoxia-ischemia in both the neonatal and adult brain. To better study mast cell function in vivo, it is important to be able to identify their environment-specific phenotype, as well as to study their interaction with other neural cells in vitro. Previous such studies of mast cells have relied on mast cells isolated from gut or bone marrow, or on a number of mast cell lines, all of which may behave differently from brain mast cells. The purpose of this study was to develop a technique for the isolation of mast cells from neonatal rat brain and to characterize these cells following hypoxia and hypoxia-ischemia. We adapted a previously described technique of coupling an antibody to the mast cell-specific Fc\u03b5R1 receptor to a MACS microbead for the selective removal of intact mast cells from a neonatal brain preparation. We have isolated toluidine blue-positive brain mast cells that provide substrate for both protein analysis and in vitro studies. These cells express proteins previously used to specifically identify microglia in the brain, Iba-1 and coronin-1a. A subpopulation of mast cells in vivo also expresses Iba-1. Thus, we report a novel method for isolation of brain mast cells suitable for the study of mast cell phenotype under a variety of conditions. Further, we suggest that the use of proteins such as Iba-1 for the identification of microglia in the brain includes the caveat that mast cells may also be detected.", "journal": "Developmental neuroscience", "date": "2013-05-29", "authors": ["Shyama DPatel", "GillianBrennan", "JacquelineBrazin", "Amber JCiardiello", "Randi BSilver", "Susan JVannucci"], "doi": "10.1159/000350928"}

This reconstructional technique was used in 11 patients undergoing metadiaphyseal resection of lower limb malignant bone tumors. All patients with Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma had multimodal treatment according to the EURO-E.W.I.N.G 99 or COSS-96 protocol. Median FU was 63 months. None of the patients experienced local recurrence during FU. 2 patients died due to distant disease during FU. Full weight- bearing was permitted after a mean of 8 months. The median MSTS score was 87%. Complications occurred in five patients. None of the complications led to failure of the biological reconstruction or to amputation. Biological reconstruction of osseous defects is always desirable when possible and aims at a permanent solution.

{"title": "Enhanced wound vascularization using a dsASCs seeded FPEG scaffold.", "abstract": "The bioengineering of autologous vascular networks is of great importance in wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are of interest due to their ability to differentiate toward various cell types, including vascular. We hypothesized that adult human ASCs embedded in a three-dimensional PEG-fibrin (FPEG) gel have the ability to modulate vascularization of a healing wound. Initial in vitro characterization of ASCs isolated from discarded burn skin samples (dsASCs) and embedded in FPEG gels indicated they could express such pericyte/smooth muscle cell markers as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2, NG2 proteoglycan, and angiopoietin-1, suggesting that these cells could potentially be involved in a supportive cell role (i.e., pericyte/mural cell) for blood vessels. Using a rat skin excision model, wounds treated with dsASCs-FPEG gels showed earlier collagen deposition and wound remodeling compared to vehicle FPEG treated wounds. Furthermore, the dsASCs-seeded gels increased the number of vessels in the wound per square millimeter by day 16 (~66.7 vs. ~36.9/mm(2)) in these same studies. dsASCs may support this increase in vascularization through their trophic contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor, as determined by in vitro analysis of mRNA and the protein levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that dsASCs were localized to the surrounding regions of large blood-perfused vessels. Human dsASCs may play a supportive role in the formation of vascular structures in the healing wound through direct mechanisms as well as indirect trophic effects. The merging of autologous grafts or bioengineered composites with the host's vasculature is critical, and the use of autologous dsASCs in these procedures may prove to be therapeutic.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2013-05-28", "authors": ["David OZamora", "ShanmugasundaramNatesan", "SandraBecerra", "NicoleWrice", "EunnaChung", "Laura JSuggs", "Robert JChristy"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-013-9352-y"}
{"title": "Membrane phospholipids, EML4-ALK, and Hsp90 as novel targets in lung cancer treatment.", "abstract": "Approximately one third of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have unresectable stage IIIA or stage IIIB disease; combined cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy delivered concurrently has been established as the standard treatment for such patients. Despite many clinical trials that tested several different radiochemotherapy combinations, it seems that a plateau of efficiencies at the acceptable risk of complications has been reached. Clinical studies indicate that the improved efficacy of radiochemotherapy is associated with the radiosensitizing effects of chemotherapy. Improvement of outcomes of this combined modality by developing novel radiosensitizers is a viable therapeutic strategy. In addition to causing cell death, ionizing radiation also induces a many-faceted signaling response, which activates numerous prosurvival pathways that lead to enhanced proliferation in the endothelial cells and increased vascularization in tumors. Radiation at doses used in the clinic activates cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, leading to increased production of arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine. The former is the initial step in the generation of eicosanoids, while the later is the initial step in the formation of lysophosphatidic acid, leading to the activation of inflammatory pathways. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) is member of the insulin superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EML4-ALK fusion gene appears unique to lung cancer and signals through extracellular signal regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is often overexpressed and present in an activated multichaperone complex in cancer cells, and it is now regarded as essential for malignant transformation and progression.

{"title": "Reciprocal epithelial:endothelial paracrine interactions during thyroid development govern follicular organization and C-cells differentiation.", "abstract": "The thyroid is a highly vascularized endocrine gland, displaying a characteristic epithelial organization in closed spheres, called follicles. Here we investigate how endothelial cells are recruited into the developing thyroid and if they control glandular organization as well as thyrocytes and C-cells differentiation. We show that endothelial cells closely surround, and then invade the expanding thyroid epithelial cell mass to become closely associated with nascent polarized follicles. This close and sustained endothelial:epithelial interaction depends on epithelial production of the angiogenic factor, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A), as its thyroid-specific genetic inactivation reduced the endothelial cell pool of the thyroid by > 90%. Vegfa KO also displayed decreased C-cells differentiation and impaired organization of the epithelial cell mass into follicles. We developed an ex vivo model of thyroid explants that faithfully mimicks bilobation of the thyroid anlagen, endothelial and C-cells invasion, folliculogenesis and differentiation. Treatment of thyroid explants at e12.5 with a VEGFR2 inhibitor ablated the endothelial pool and reproduced ex vivo folliculogenesis defects observed in conditional Vegfa KO. In the absence of any blood supply, rescue by embryonic endothelial progenitor cells restored folliculogenesis, accelerated lumen expansion and stimulated calcitonin expression by C-cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that, in developing mouse thyroid, epithelial production of VEGF-A is necessary for endothelial cells recruitment and expansion.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous messenger produced mainly by cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), is a proangiogenic vasodilator. We hypothesized that a reduction in CSE activity may alter the angiogenic balance in pregnancy and induce abnormal placentation and maternal hypertension.\nPlasma levels of H2S were significantly decreased in women with preeclampsia (P<0.01), which was associated with reduced placental CSE expression as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Inhibition of CSE activity by DL-propargylglycine reduced placental growth factorproduction from first-trimester (8-12 weeks gestation) human placental explants and inhibited trophoblast invasion in vitro. Knockdown of CSE in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by small-interfering RNA increased the release of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endoglin, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas adenoviral-mediated CSE overexpression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibited their release. Administration of DL-propargylglycine to pregnant mice induced hypertension and liver damage, promoted abnormal labyrinth vascularization in the placenta, and decreased fetal growth. Finally, a slow-releasing H2S-generating compound, GYY4137, inhibited circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endoglin levels and restored fetal growth in mice that was compromised by DL-propargylglycine treatment, demonstrating that the effect of CSE inhibitor was attributable to inhibition of H2S production.\nThese results imply that endogenous H2S is required for healthy placental vasculature and that a decrease in CSE/H2S activity may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2013-05-25", "authors": ["KeqingWang", "ShakilAhmad", "MengCai", "JillianRennie", "TakeshiFujisawa", "FatimaCrispi", "JamesBaily", "Mark RMiller", "MelissaCudmore", "Patrick W FHadoke", "RuiWang", "EduardGratac\u00f3s", "Irina ABuhimschi", "Catalin SBuhimschi", "AsifAhmed"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.001631"}

The results indicated that at 7\u00a0days following culture, CD133 and CD34 cell markers were 69.44 and 81.05%, respectively. MTT assay demonstrated that the optical density (OD) value of the 10\u00a0nmol/l group was markedly higher than that of the 0 and 100\u00a0nmol/l groups. The OD value of the 0\u00a0nmol/l group was higher than the 100\u00a0nmol/l group (P<0.05). EPC migration, in\u00a0vitro vascularization and differentiation were higher in the 100 and 10\u00a0nmol/l groups compared with the 0\u00a0nmol/l group. These parameters were higher in the 100\u00a0nmol/l than the 10\u00a0nmol/l group (P<0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that migration, in\u00a0vitro vasculogenesis and differentiation into endothelial cells is regulated by 17\u03b2\u2011estradiol and enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. Proliferation levels were contrary to these observations, with levels decreasing as the concentration of 17\u03b2\u2011estradiol increased.", "journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "date": "2013-05-25", "authors": ["Jin-ChengZhang", "GangL\u00fc"], "doi": "10.3892/mmr.2013.1486"}

We analyzed Angptl2 and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) expressions in normal and vascularized corneas by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Corneal hemangiogenic and lymphangiogenic responses, and macrophage infiltration were assessed by immunofluorescent microscopic studies using specific antibodies against CD31, LYVE-1, and F4/80, and compared to their corresponding background. Subconjunctival injection of Angptl2 siRNA to the sutured corneas was also performed.\nAngptl2 mRNA expression increased markedly in the neovascularized corneas compared to the normal cornea. Angptl2 protein was expressed strongly in the corneal epithelium and stroma of the vascularized cornea. The regions showing hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were increased significantly in K14-Angptl2 mice and reduced in Angptl2(-/-) mice compared to their corresponding background strains. In contrast to control mice, the number of F4/80-positive cells, as well as the expressions of F4/80 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be higher in K14-Angptl2 mice and lower in Angptl2(-/-) mice. Subconjunctival injection of Angptl2 siRNA significantly inhibited hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the sutured corneas.\nOur findings demonstrated Angptl2 to be upregulated in corneal inflammation, and highlight that corneal hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis may be driven by Angptk2 overexpression via macrophage infiltration and IL-1\u03b2 expression.

Unfortunately, this ideal situation is rarely encountered in the clinical setting.\nTo assess the technical feasibility of and define the surgical procedure for harvesting the sternohyoid muscle as a novel free flap for use in facial reanimation indications.\nFresh, postmortem, nonfixed cadavers were used to define the anatomy and perform the flap harvest procedures. Twenty-four flap harvests were performed. Angiography was performed on the pedicle of the harvested flaps to assess potential flap perfusion. Adenosine triphosphatase staining was performed on the muscle specimens to establish fiber type.\nThe harvest technique, pedicle (arterial or venous), nerve length, and flap geometry parameters were characterized.\nThe sternohyoid muscle was found to be reliably vascularized by the superior thyroid artery in all cases with an appropriate arterial and venous pedicle for vascular anastomosis. The mean arterial (5.5 cm) and venous (5.9 cm) pedicle lengths are comparable with gracilis flaps. The mean motor nerve length was 10.7 cm. The inclusion of the hyoid bone allows rigid fixation, and the muscle size, fiber type, and volume profiles all compare favorably to the gracilis flap for use in the indication of facial reanimation.

An accurate etiological diagnosis is of paramount importance to provide the appropriate treatment, prognosis and genetic counselling. High resolution sonography of the peripheral nervous system allows nerves to be readily visualized and to assess their morphology. Ultrasonography has brought pathophysiological insights and substantially added to diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions amongst mononeuropathies. In this study the literature on its clinical application in polyneuropathy is reviewed. Several polyneuropathies have been studied by means of ultrasound: Charcot-Marie-Tooth, hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy, paraneoplastic polyneuropathy, leprosy and diabetic neuropathy. The most prominent reported pathological changes were nerve enlargement, increased hypo-echogenicity and increased intraneural vascularization. Sonography revealed intriguingly different patterns of nerve enlargement between inflammatory neuropathies and axonal and inherited polyneuropathies. However, many studies concerned case reports or case series and showed methodological shortcomings.

Eligible studies were published in English, reported diagnostic performance of elastography (using elasticity score or strain ratio) with or without B-mode ultrasound in differentiation of thyroid nodules, and used histology or cytology as the reference standard. Summary diagnostic performance measures were assessed for each of the elasticity measuring methods and ultrasound features by means of a bivariate random effects model.\nTwenty-four studies provided relevant information on more than 2624 patients and 3531 thyroid nodules (927 malignant and 2604 benign). Six ultrasound features (echogenicity, calcifications, margins, halo sign, shape, and color Doppler flow pattern) were compared with elasticity score and strain ratio. The respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: elasticity score, 82% and 82%; strain ratio, 89% and 82%; hypoechogenicity, 78% and 55%; microcalcifications, 50% and 80%; irregular margins, 66% and 81%; absent halo sign, 56% and 57%; nodule vertical development, 46% and 77%; and intranodular vascularization, 40% and 61%.\nEvaluation of thyroid nodules with ultrasound elastography appears to be both more sensitive and specific than each of the ultrasound features.

Serial MRI examinations before detecting hypervascular HCC were evaluated to determine whether hypervascular HCC showed the presence of a hypointense nodule on the hepatobiliary phase and hypovascularity (high-risk nodule) before hyper-vascularization. The size of newly developed hypervascular HCCs and the duration of hyper-vascularization from initial detection of a high-risk nodule were compared between HCCs with and without the presence of a high-risk nodule.\nEleven (34.4%) of 32 newly developed hypervascular HCCs had the presence of high-risk nodule before hypervascularization. The size of newly developed hypervascular HCCs was significantly smaller in HCC with high-risk nodule presence (mean, 9.5 mm) than in HCC without the presence of high-risk nodule (mean, 16.4 mm) (p = 0.004).

{"title": "[Ovarian aging and infertility].", "abstract": "The biological state of the ovum remains the key element in normal reproduction. Age-related decrease in the number of oocytes, as well as disturbed neuroendocrine function of the ovary and lesions in the uterus, contribute to reduced fertility. Decreasing number of ovarian follicles is accompanied by reduction of their quality including mainly abnormalities of the nucleus (dispersed chromatin, decondensation of chromosomes and abnormalities connected with the spindle apparatus). This results in failed reproduction due to abnormal gametogenesis, fertilization process, early development of the embryo and abnormal implantation. This work describes age-related biochemical mechanisms conditioning molecular changes occurring due to abnormal microenvironment of the ovary; their accumulation leads to aging and to a more rapid apoptosis of the oocyte. There are many theories explaining the causes of oocyte destruction, including abnormal vascularization, oxidative stress, imbalance of free radicals, influence of toxic compounds and genetic changes. Decreased blood perfusion in the microenvironment of a maturating ovum leads to hypoxia and thus to a chain of reactions of oxidative stress. Oxidative imbalance leads to abnormalities of cellular biomolecules. Moreover it is suggested that glycation processes in a cell, leading to the formation of compounds called AGEs (Advanced Glycation End Products), are also responsible for aging of the cells. They contribute directly to protein damage, induce a chain of reactions of oxidative stress, and increase the inflammatory reactions. Recently the role of mitochondria and telomeres in the aging process and loss of reproductive functions has been especially underscored. Moreover this work stresses the prognostic value of clinically used markers evaluating the ovarian reserve.

{"title": "Deletion of mesenchymal glucocorticoid receptor attenuates embryonic lung development and abdominal wall closure.", "abstract": "As a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is essential for normal embryonic development. To date, the role of mesenchymal glucocorticoid signaling during development has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the role of the GR during embryogenesis specifically in mesenchymal tissues. To this aim, we crossed GRflox mice with Dermo1-Cre mice to generate GR(Dermo1) mice, where the GR gene was deleted within mesenchymal cells. Compared to their wild type littermates, GR(Dermo1) mice displayed severe pulmonary atelectasis, defects in abdominal wall formation resulting in intestinal herniation, abnormal extracellular matrix synthesis in connective tissues and high postnatal lethality. Lungs of GR(Dermo1) mice failed to progress from the canalicular to saccular stage, as evidenced by the presence of immature air sacs, thickened interstitial mesenchyme and an underdeveloped vascular network between E17.5 and E18.5. Furthermore, myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells, although present in normal numbers in GR(Dermo1) animals, were characterized by significantly reduced elastin synthesis, whilst epithelial lining cells of the immature saccules were poorly differentiated. A marked reduction in normal elastin and collagen deposits were also observed in connective tissues adjacent to the umbilical hernia. This study demonstrates that eliminating the GR in cells of the mesenchymal lineage results in marked effects on interstitial fibroblast function, including a significant decrease in elastin synthesis. This results in lung atelectasis and postnatal lethality, as well as additional and hitherto unrecognized developmental defects in abdominal wall formation. In addition, altered glucocorticoid signaling in the mesenchyme attenuates normal lung epithelial differentiation.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-05-23", "authors": ["AiqingLi", "RowanHardy", "ShihaniStoner", "JanTuckermann", "MarkusSeibel", "HongZhou"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0063578"}

Therefore, we investigated whether this G protein-coupled receptor plays a role in tumor progression. We used a murine melanoma cell line that expresses the kinin B1 receptor and does not express the kinin B2 receptor to investigate the precise contribution of activation of the B1 receptor in tumor progression and correlated events using various in vitro and in vivo approaches. Activation of the kinin B1 receptor in the absence of B2 receptor inhibits cell migration in vitro and decreases tumor formation in vivo. Moreover, tumors formed from cells stimulated with B1-specific agonist showed several features of decreased aggressiveness, such as smaller size and infiltration of inflammatory cells within the tumor area, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the host anti-tumor immune response, lower number of cells undergoing mitosis, a poorer vascular network, no signs of invasion of surrounding tissues or metastasis and increased animal survival.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate an alternative surgical technique to advanced Kienb\u00f6ck disease: lunate excision and replacement with pedicled vascularized scaphoid graft and partial radioscaphoidal arthrodesis. The main advantage of the proposed intervention is to preserve mobility while not jeopardizing prime clinical outcomes such as pain. By replacing the devitalized lunate we aim at maintaining midcarpal range of motion, and preventing disease progression with carpal collapse and osteoarthritis of the wrist. Between 2002 and 2008, 13 patients of mean age 41 years (range, 25 to 57 y) were operated using this technique. The surgical act included 3 key steps. First, we excised the lunate, then, filled the generated gap with the rotated scaphoid, using it as a pedicled vascularized autograft. Finally, we performed a partial radioscaphoid arthrodesis. At the final follow-up, none of the intervened patients had pain at rest, and 6 patients could perform nonrestricted daily activities.

Vascularized bone grafting has been proposed as a treatment option for scaphoid nonunions with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole. Zaidemberg and colleagues first introduced the dorsal distal radius graft that has gained considerable popularity in the past 2 decades. Less commonly, the 2,3 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery pedicled vascularized bone graft has been used successfully with equally promising results. It has become the graft of our choice for the treatment of scaphoid nonunions as it has a longer pedicle and is able to provide a wider arc of rotation that allows easier reach of the volar carpus. The use of rigid internal fixation with screws also permitted early wrist range of motion and shorter periods of immobilization. In this article, we describe our surgical technique of harvesting the 2,3 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery pedicled vascularized bone graft.

After 4 and 8 weeks, cranial tissue samples were taken for histological and immunofluorescence analysis.\nWe observed a new bone formation in all of the samples but the most relevant differences in defect correction were shown by stem cell-collagen samples 4 weeks after implant, suggesting a faster regeneration ability of the combined constructs. The presence of human cells in the newly formed bone was confirmed by confocal analysis with an antibody directed to a human mitochondrial protein.

{"title": "Composite hydrogel scaffolds with controlled pore opening via biodegradable hydrogel porogen degradation.", "abstract": "Poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) biodegradable hydrogel systems have garnered much attention in recent years due to their appealing properties for biomedical applications. These hydrogel systems exhibit properties similar to natural soft tissue, degrade in aqueous environments, and have easily tunable properties that have been well studied and understood. In most cases, tissue engineering scaffolds must possess a three-dimensional interconnected porous network for tissue ingrowth and construct vascularization. Here, PBAE properties were explored and systems were selected to serve as both the pore-forming agent and the outer matrix of a scaffold that exhibits controlled pore opening upon degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a biodegradable hydrogel porogen system entrapped in a degradable hydrogel outer matrix. Scaffolds were prepared, and the degradation, compressive moduli, and porosity were analyzed. An added advantage of a degradable porogen is the potential for controlled drug release, and a model protein was released from the porogen particles to demonstrate this application. Finally, pluripotent cells seeded onto predegraded scaffolds were viable during the first 24 h of exposure, and furthermore, cell tracking confirmed the presence of cells within the pores of the scaffold. Overall, these present studies demonstrate the possibility of using these biodegradable hydrogel porogen-matrix systems as tissue engineering scaffolding materials.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

Unfortunately, current treatments such as autologous bone grafting or recombinant proteins (BMP-2) have numerous clinical shortcomings. Here, we directly compare the efficacy of NELL-1, a novel osteoinductive growth factor, to two currently available treatments, (1) recombinant BMP-2 and (2) iliac crest bone grafting, in a spinal fusion model.\nTwenty-six skeletally mature athymic rats underwent posterolateral spine fusion of L4/L5 vertebrae. Treatment groups included NELL-1 (10 and 50 \u03bcg) in a demineralized bone matrix (DBX), as compared to BMP-2 (90 \u03bcg) in an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) or morselized iliac crest bone. Scaffolds without recombinant protein were used as controls. Animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks post-operative and fusion was assessed by manual palpation, radiography [high-resolution X-ray, micro-computed tomography (microCT)], histology (hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome) and immunohistochemistry (osteocalcin).\nResults showed 100 % fusion in all NELL-1- and BMP-2-treated samples. In contrast, lower rates of fusion were observed in scaffold-only and bone graft treatment groups. MicroCT scans revealed radiographic evidence of fusion among spines treated with NELL-1. Bone bridging was also observed with BMP-2 treatment, but was accompanied by inner radiolucency, suggesting cyst-like bone formation. Histologically, NELL-1-treated grafts showed increased bone formation, endochondral ossification and vascularization. Although BMP-2 treated grafts exhibited increased bone formation and angiogenesis, numerous adipocytes were also observed.\nNELL-1-based bone grafts are comparable to BMP-2 + ACS in spinal fusion efficacy. Histological differences were observed however, including robust endochondral ossification with NELL-1 treatment as compared to lipid-filled bone with BMP-2 treatment.

These features are often thought of as separate events in tumor progression and the two fields of research have frequently been considered as independent. However, as we highlight in this review, activated oncogenes and deregulated angiogenesis are tightly associated, as mutations in cancer cells can lead to perturbation of the pro- and anti-angiogenic balance thereby causing aberrant angiogenesis. We propose that normalization of the vascular network by targeting oncogenes in the tumor cells might lead to more efficient and sustained therapeutic effects compared to therapies targeting tumor vessels. We discuss how pharmacological inhibition of oncogenes in tumor cells restores a functional vasculature by bystander anti-angiogenic effect.

However, the effects of this coating on the early inflammatory and angiogenic host tissue response still remain elusive. Therefore, the aim of the present in\u00a0vivo study was to analyze the biocompatibility and vascularization of silver acetate-coated and uncoated vascular grafts during the initial phase after implantation.\nTwo different prosthetic vascular grafts (ie, uncoated Dacron and silver acetate-coated Dacron Silver) were implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of C57BL/6 mice (n\u00a0= 8 per group) to study angiogenesis and leukocytic inflammation at the implantation site by means of repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy over a 14-day period. At the end of the in\u00a0vivo experiments, collagen formation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation were analyzed in the newly developed granulation tissue surrounding the implants by histology and immunohistochemistry.\nDuring the initial 14 days after implantation, Dacron Silver exhibited an improved vascularization, as indicated by a significantly increased functional capillary density compared with Dacron. This was not associated with a stronger leukocytic inflammatory host tissue response to the implants. Moreover, silver acetate coating did not affect collagen formation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation at the implantation site.\nSilver acetate coating of prosthetic vascular grafts improves their early vascularization without inducing severe\u00a0inflammatory side effects.

{"title": "Endothelial microvascular networks affect gene-expression profiles and osteogenic potential of tissue-engineered constructs.", "abstract": "A major determinant of the potential size of cell/scaffold constructs in tissue engineering is vascularization. The aims of this study were twofold: first to determine the in vitro angiogenic and osteogenic gene-expression profiles of endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cocultured in a dynamic 3D environment; and second, to assess differentiation and the potential for osteogenesis after in vivo implantation.\nMSCs and ECs were grown in dynamic culture in poly(L-lactide-co-1,5-dioxepan-2-one) (poly(LLA-co-DXO)) copolymer scaffolds for 1 week, to generate three-dimensional endothelial microvascular networks. The constructs were then implanted in vivo, in a murine model for ectopic bone formation. Expression of selected genes for angiogenesis and osteogenesis was studied after a 1-week culture in vitro. Human cell proliferation was assessed as expression of ki67, whereas \u03b1-smooth muscle actin was used to determine the perivascular differentiation of MSCs. Osteogenesis was evaluated in vivo through detection of selected markers, by using real-time RT-PCR, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Alizarin Red, hematoxylin/eosin (HE), and Masson trichrome staining.\nThe results show that endothelial microvascular networks could be generated in a poly(LLA-co-DXO) scaffold in vitro and sustained after in vivo implantation. The addition of ECs to MSCs influenced both angiogenic and osteogenic gene-expression profiles. Furthermore, human ki67 was upregulated before and after implantation. MSCs could support functional blood vessels as perivascular cells independent of implanted ECs. In addition, the expression of ALP was upregulated in the presence of endothelial microvascular networks.\nThis study demonstrates that copolymer poly(LLA-co-DXO) scaffolds can be prevascularized with ECs and MSCs.

After genetic ablation, beta cells are initially dysfunctional or dying, and blood glucose levels increase fourfold. During a 2-week period, hyperglycemia eventually normalizes as beta cell mass regenerates.

ECFCs are mainly mobilized from bone marrow to promote vascularization and represent a promising tool for cell-based therapy of severe ischemic diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates the proliferation of peripheral blood-derived ECFCs (PB-ECFCs) through oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). VEGF-induced Ca(2+) spikes are driven by the interplay between inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-dependent Ca(2+) release and store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). The therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood-derived ECFCs (UCB-ECFCs) has also been shown in recent studies. However, VEGF-induced proliferation of UCB-ECFCs is faster compared with their peripheral counterpart. Unlike PB-ECFCs, UCB-ECFCs express canonical transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) that mediates diacylglycerol-dependent Ca(2+) entry. The present study aimed at investigating whether the higher proliferative potential of UCB-ECFCs was associated to any difference in the molecular underpinnings of their Ca(2+) response to VEGF. We found that VEGF induces oscillations in [Ca(2+)]i that are patterned by the interaction between InsP3-dependent Ca(2+) release and SOCE. Unlike PB-ECFCs, VEGF-evoked Ca(2+) oscillations do not arise in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) entry and after pharmacological (with Pyr3 and flufenamic acid) and genetic (by employing selective small interference RNA) suppression of TRPC3. VEGF-induced UCB-ECFC proliferation is abrogated on inhibition of the intracellular Ca(2+) spikes. Therefore, the Ca(2+) response to VEGF in UCB-ECFCs is shaped by a different Ca(2+) machinery as compared with PB-ECFCs, and TRPC3 stands out as a promising target in EPC-based treatment of ischemic pathologies.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2013-05-21", "authors": ["SilviaDragoni", "UmbertoLaforenza", "ElisaBonetti", "FrancescoLodola", "CinziaBottino", "GermanoGuerra", "AlessandroBorghesi", "MauroStronati", "VittorioRosti", "FrancoTanzi", "FrancescoMoccia"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2013.0032"}

We previously showed that decellularization of porcine kidneys yields renal extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds that maintain their basic components, support cell growth and welfare in vitro and in vivo, and show an intact vasculature that, when such scaffolds are implanted in vivo, is able to sustain physiological blood pressure. The purpose of the current study was to test if the same strategy can be applied to discarded human kidneys in order to obtain human renal ECM scaffolds. The results show that the sodium dodecylsulfate-based decellularization protocol completely cleared the cellular compartment in these kidneys, while the innate ECM framework retained its architecture and biochemical properties. Samples of human renal ECM scaffolds stimulated angiogenesis in a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Importantly, the innate vascular network in the human renal ECM scaffolds retained its compliance.

Although there has been much discussion in the literature about what transcolumellar scar design creates the best aesthetic result, placement of the scar in a previously opened nose has not been widely discussed. In light of the outstanding blood supply to the nose, and often the desire to reposition the transcolumellar scar, the senior surgeon (R.J.R.) has ignored prior incisions in the columella and has chosen to place the incision in the best location for the current operative plan.\nThis article retrospectively reviewed 100 secondary rhinoplasty patients who had undergone two open procedures with different transcolumellar incisions performed by the senior surgeon from 2000 to 2010. Scar quality was graded preoperatively and postoperatively by three reviewers on a four-point scale from imperceptible to poor scar.\nScar quality averaged 1.68 preoperatively and 1.61 postoperatively, indicating scar quality between imperceptible and barely perceptible. There was no skin bridge necrosis in the series, no infection, and no wound breakdown. Patient satisfaction was noted to be high overall.\nAnatomical studies have previously shown the safety of the transcolumellar incision in rhinoplasty. This article has shown the safety of ignoring prior incisions in the columella and basing the new scar location solely on where the surgeon feels is ideal.

Presentation of cognate antigen by either graft endothelial cells or bone marrow-derived APCs that extend into the capillary lumen was sufficient for T cell migration. The adhesion and transmigration of antigen-nonspecific (bystander) effector T cells, on the other hand, remained dependent on G\u03b1i, but required the presence of antigen-specific effector T cells. These findings underscore the primary role of cognate antigen presented by either endothelial cells or bone marrow-derived APCs in the migration of T cells across endothelial barriers and have important implications for the prevention and treatment of graft rejection.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2013-05-17", "authors": ["Jeffrey MWalch", "QiangZeng", "QiLi", "Martin HOberbarnscheidt", "Rosemary AHoffman", "Amanda LWilliams", "David MRothstein", "Warren DShlomchik", "Jiyun VKim", "GeoffreyCamirand", "Fadi GLakkis"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI66722\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02742.x\n10.1038/76267\n10.1073/pnas.092596999\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02302.x\n10.1016/0092-8674(94)90337-9\n10.1016/j.immuni.2008.12.020\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03762.x\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03492.x\n10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00130-8\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02323.x\n10.1097/TP.0b013e31820f0856\n10.1084/jem.178.1.367\n10.1084/jem.187.2.205\n10.1084/jem.20021378\n10.1182/blood-2003-08-2717\n10.1084/jem.20070064\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02460.x\n10.1038/341619a0\n10.1073/pnas.94.8.3909\n10.1016/j.immuni.2010.03.007\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132554\n10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03671.x\n10.1073/pnas.1102288108\n10.1016/j.it.2011.09.006\n10.1084/jem.20082129\n10.1084/jem.20111718\n10.1126/science.1102901\n10.1073/pnas.1018973108\n10.1073/pnas.1018975108\n10.1097/00007890-197310000-00010\n10.1038/nm1257"}

However, isolation, expansion, and application of autologous cells do suffer from variability in therapeutic efficacy due to donor to donor differences and due to prolonged culture. One important source of autologous cells is mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which can differentiate toward endothelial-like cells, thus making them an ideal candidate as cell source for tissue vascularization. Here we screened MSCs from 20 donors for their endothelial differentiation capacity and correlated it with the gene expression profile of the whole genome in the undifferentiated state. Cells of all donors were able to form tubes on Matrigel and induced the expression of endothelial genes, although with quantitative differences. In addition, we analyzed the effect of prolonged in vitro expansion on the multipotency of human MSCs and found that endothelial differentiation is only mildly sensitive to expansion-induced loss of differentiation as compared to osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Our results show the robustness of the endothelial differentiation protocol and the gene expression data give insight in the differences in endothelial differentiation between donors.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Angiogenesis is an integral process of inflammatory responses in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and required for mucosal remodeling during restitution. The aim of this study was to determine whether Sb alters VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) signaling, a central regulator of angiogenesis.\nHUVEC were used to examine the effects of Sb on signaling and on capillary tube formation (using the ECMatrix\u2122 system). The effects of Sb on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis were examined in vivo using an adenovirus expressing VEGF-A(164) in the ears of adult nude mice (NuNu). The effects of Sb on blood vessel volume branching and density in DSS-induced colitis was quantified using VESsel GENeration (VESGEN) software.\n1) Sb treatment attenuated weight-loss (p<0.01) and histological damage (p<0.01) in DSS colitis. VESGEN analysis of angiogenesis showed significantly increased blood vessel density and volume in DSS-treated mice compared to control. Sb treatment significantly reduced the neo-vascularization associated with acute DSS colitis and accelerated mucosal recovery restoration of the lamina propria capillary network to a normal morphology. 2) Sb inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo in the mouse ear model. 3) Sb also significantly inhibited angiogenesis in vitro in the capillary tube assay in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.01). 4) In HUVEC, Sb reduced basal VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in response to VEGF as well as activation of the downstream kinases PLC\u03b3 and Erk1/2.\nOur findings indicate that the probiotic yeast S boulardii can modulate angiogenesis to limit intestinal inflammation and promote mucosal tissue repair by regulating VEGFR signaling.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-05-16", "authors": ["XinhuaChen", "GuoxunYang", "Joo-HyeSong", "HuaXu", "DanLi", "JeffreyGoldsmith", "HuiyanZeng", "Patricia AParsons-Wingerter", "Hans-ChristianReinecker", "Ciaran PKelly"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0064227"}

OC is the most frequent cause of leg weakness in rapidly growing pigs causing animal welfare issues and economic losses. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the Porcine 60k SNPChip in animals of the breed Large White (n\u2009=\u2009298) to identify chromosome regions and candidate genes associated with OC lesion scores. A total of 19 SNPs on chromosomes (SSC) 3, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 18 were significantly associated with OC lesion scores (p-values\u2009\u2264\u200910(-5)). The SNPs MARC0098684, MARC00840086, MARC0093124, and ASGA0062794 at SSC14 36.1-38.2\u2009Mb encompass a region of six linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. The most significant SNP ASGA0062794 is located in a LD block spanning 465\u2009kb and covering the gene encoding T-box transcription factor 5 (TBX5). A SNP (c.54T\u2009>\u2009C) identified in TBX5 was significantly associated with OC lesion scores in a single-marker analysis. TBX5 c.54T\u2009>\u2009C showed highest LD with ASGA00627974 (r (2)\u2009=\u20090.96) and superior association with OC lesion scores over other SNPs when included in the genome scan, whereas its treatment as an additional fixed effect in the GWAS statistical model led to a drop of significance of nearby markers. Moreover, real-time PCR showed different transcript abundance of TBX5 in healthy and defect cartilage. The results imply that the association signal obtained on SCC14 is largely attributable to TBX5 c.54T\u2009>\u2009C likely to be in LD with a regulatory polymorphism of TBX5.

{"title": "Protective effects of angiopoietin-like 4 on cerebrovascular and functional damages in ischaemic stroke.", "abstract": "Given the impact of vascular injuries and oedema on brain damage caused during stroke, vascular protection represents a major medical need. We hypothesized that angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a regulator of endothelial barrier integrity, might exert a protective effect during ischaemic stroke.\nUsing a murine transient ischaemic stroke model, treatment with recombinant ANGPTL4 led to significantly decreased infarct size and improved behaviour. Quantitative characteristics of the vascular network (density and branchpoints) were preserved in ANGPTL4-treated mice. Integrity of tight and adherens junctions was also quantified and ANGPTL4-treated mice displayed increased VE-cadherin and claudin-5-positive areas. Brain oedema was thus significantly decreased in ANGPTL4-treated mice. In accordance, vascular damage and infarct severity were increased in angptl4-deficient mice thus providing genetic evidence that ANGPTL4 preserves brain tissue from ischaemia-induced alterations. Altogether, these data show that ANGPTL4 protects not only the global vascular network, but also interendothelial junctions and controls both deleterious inflammatory response and oedema. Mechanistically, ANGPTL4 counteracted VEGF signalling and thereby diminished Src-signalling downstream from VEGFR2. This led to decreased VEGFR2-VE-cadherin complex disruption, increased stability of junctions and thus increased endothelial cell barrier integrity of the cerebral microcirculation. In addition, ANGPTL4 prevented neuronal loss in the ischaemic area.\nThese results, therefore, show ANGPTL4 counteracts the loss of vascular integrity in ischaemic stroke, by restricting Src kinase signalling downstream from VEGFR2. ANGPTL4 treatment thus reduces oedema, infarct size, neuronal loss, and improves mice behaviour. These results suggest that ANGPTL4 constitutes a relevant target for vasculoprotection and cerebral protection during stroke.", "journal": "European heart journal", "date": "2013-05-16", "authors": ["ClaireBouleti", "ThomasMathivet", "BerardCoqueran", "Jean-MichelSerfaty", "MathieuLesage", "ElodieBerland", "CorinneArdidie-Robouant", "GillesKauffenstein", "DanielHenrion", "BertrandLapergue", "MikaelMazighi", "CharlesDuyckaerts", "GavinThurston", "David MValenzuela", "Andrew JMurphy", "George DYancopoulos", "CatherineMonnot", "IsabelleMargaill", "StephaneGermain"], "doi": "10.1093/eurheartj/eht153"}

The severity of hypospadias, technique, complications, and follow-up were assessed.\nOver a 9.4-year period, 102 children (mean age 4.2 years, range 6 months to 11 years) were operated for primary hypospadias using the LDIF technique. All children had poorly formed urethral plates and hence were considered unsuitable for tubularized incised plate repair. The hypospadias was classified as midpenile, proximal penile/penoscrotal or perineal in 29, 64, and 9 children respectively. Onlay LDIF repair was done in 85 children, while in 17 children, tubularized LDIF repair was performed. At a mean follow-up of 1.8 years, complications occurred in 12 (12%) children. Complications were more common after tubularized repairs than onlay repairs (24% vs. 9.5%). All glans dehiscences occurred after onlay repairs, while meatal stenosis and diverticulum occurred after tubularized repairs. No child had urethral stenosis after onlay repair, and uroflow studies in 16 children demonstrated normal curves and flow rates.\nWe report the use of LDIF for single-stage mid and proximal hypospadias repair with good success and an acceptable complication rate.

Given its role in regulating tumor vascularization, VEGF has been targeted in various cancer treatments, and anti-VEGF therapy has been used clinically for treatment of several types of cancer. Systems biology approaches, particularly computational models, provide insight into the complexity of tumor angiogenesis. These models complement experimental studies and aid in the development of effective therapies targeting angiogenesis.\nWe developed an experiment-based, molecular-detailed compartment model of VEGF kinetics and transport to investigate the distribution of two major VEGF isoforms (VEGF121 and VEGF165) in the body. The model is applied to predict the dynamics of tumor VEGF and, importantly, to gain insight into how tumor VEGF responds to an intravenous injection of an anti-VEGF agent.\nThe model predicts that free VEGF in the tumor interstitium is seven to 13 times higher than plasma VEGF and is predominantly in the form of VEGF121 (>70%), predictions that are validated by experimental data. The model also predicts that tumor VEGF can increase or decrease with anti-VEGF treatment depending on tumor microenvironment, pointing to the importance of personalized medicine.\nThis computational study suggests that the rate of VEGF secretion by tumor cells may serve as a biomarker to predict the patient population that is likely to respond to anti-VEGF treatment.

Hypoxic signaling appears to be largely responsible for triggering release of these angiogenic cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Three-dimensional (3D) culture may promote activation of hypoxia-induced pathways, and has furthermore been shown to enhance cell survival by promoting cell-cell interactions while increasing angiogenic potential. However, the development of hypoxia within ADSC spheroids is difficult to characterize. In the present study, we investigated the impact of spheroid size on hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1 activity in spheroid cultures under atmospheric and physiological oxygen conditions using a fluorescent marker. Hypoxia could be induced and modulated by controlling the size of the spheroid; HIF-1 activity increased with spheroid size and with decreasing external oxygen concentration. Furthermore, VEGF secretion was impacted by the hypoxic status of the culture, increasing with elevated HIF-1 activity, up to the point at which viability was compromised. Together, these results suggest the ability to use 3D culture geometry as a means to control output of angiogenic factors from ADSCs, and imply that at a particular environmental oxygen concentration an optimal culture size for cytokine production exists.

Although 20-40% of all women in reproductive age may have uterine leiomyomas, they are not very common in pregnancy. Only 0.3-2.6% af all pregnant women are diagnosed with leiomyomas. The leiomyomas are symptomatic in 20-50% of all cases. Clinical symptoms are usually excessive or irregular menstrual bleeding, problems resulting from adjacent organs pressure, sterility miscarriage or problems during the labour. Leiomyomas are known to have estrogen receptors and can demonstrate an extensive growth in high estrogens concentration environment. During the pregnancy they can grow, stay the same size or as well decrease. Rapid leiomyoma's growth, caused by its transformation into sarcoma, takes place in about 0.1-0.8% of all cases.

She had four vaginal deliveries and one cesarean section. The patients delivered three months before admission. Since the labour she had suffered from dysuria and noticed a quick waits enlargement. On admission the patient was in good general condition, without any stomachache. A giant tumor in her lower and middle abdomen was found. The tumor reached three fingers above the navel. In the ultrasound scan a large solid-cystic the tumor with moderate vascularization was described. It looked like the ovarian neoplasm. The CA-125 plasma concentration was 389,5 IU/ml. After giving a written informed consent the patient had an operation. During the operation a solid-cystic peducled uterine tumor was diagnosed. The diameter of the tumor was about 25 cm. The uterine and uterine appendages had no pathological macroscopic changes. Intraoperative histopathological examination was carried out and revealed mesenchymal tumor without evident polymorphism or mitosis.

Mice with CIA were treated with the TLR-5 agonist flagellin to document the effect of TLR-5 ligation in RA pathology. Vascularization in CIA was determined by immunohistochemical analysis and determination of cytokine levels in ankle joints. Spleen Th17 cells and joint interleukin-17 (IL-17) were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The development of Th17 cells induced by TLR-5 ligation was validated in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\nLigation of TLR-5 to endogenous ligands expressed in RA synovial fluid contributed to endothelial cell infiltration and tube formation. Furthermore, treatment with flagellin after the onset of CIA exacerbated joint inflammation; in contrast, inflammation in control mice remained at a plateau phase. We showed that TLR-5-enhanced disease severity was attributable to Th17 cell differentiation and joint vascularization in CIA. Examination of the underlying mechanism using RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells documented that ligation of TLR-5 in myeloid cells and production of Th17-promoting cytokines were necessary for Th17 cell polarization. Additionally, we demonstrated that blockade of the IL-17 cascade markedly reduced endothelial cell migration activated by flagellin-conditioned medium, suggesting that TLR-5 ligation can mediate RA angiogenesis either directly by attracting endothelial cells or indirectly by fostering Th17 cell development.\nOur data demonstrate a novel role for TLR-5 in RA angiogenesis; thus, TLR-5 may be a promising new target for RA treatment.", "journal": "Arthritis and rheumatism", "date": "2013-05-15", "authors": ["Seung-JaeKim", "ZhenlongChen", "Nathan DChamberlain", "Michael VVolin", "WilliamSwedler", "SuncicaVolkov", "NaderaSweiss", "ShivaShahrara"], "doi": "10.1002/art.37992"}

We and others have shown that human endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC) combined with mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC) can be used to \"bio-engineer\" functional human blood vessels. Here we investigated whether ECFC + MPC form functional vessels in ischemic myocardium and whether this affects cardiac function or remodeling. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) was induced in 12-week-old immunodeficient rats by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. After 40 min, myocardium was reperfused and ECFC + MPC (2 \u00d7 10(6) cells, 2:3 ratio) or PBS was injected. Luciferase assays after injection of luciferase-labeled ECFC + MPC showed that 1,500 ECFC were present at day 14. Human ECFC-lined perfused vessels were directly visualized by femoral vein injection of a fluorescently-tagged human-specific lectin in hearts injected with ECFC + MPC but not PBS alone. While infarct size at day 1 was no different, LV dimensions and heart weight to tibia length ratios were lower in cell-treated hearts compared with PBS at 4 months, suggesting post-infarction remodeling was ameliorated by local cell injection. Fractional shortening, LV wall motion score, and fibrotic area were not different between groups at 4 months. However, pressure-volume loops demonstrated improved cardiac function and reduced volumes in cell-treated animals.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are a subtype of stem cells with high proliferative potential that are capable of differentiating into mature endothelial cells, thus contributing to neovascularization in tumors. In response to tumor-secreted cytokines, EPCs mobilize from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood, home to the tumor site, and differentiate to mature endothelial cells and secrete proangiogenic factors to facilitate vascularization of tumors. In this review, we summarize the expression of surface markers, cytokines, receptors, adhesion molecules, proteases, and cell signaling mechanisms involved in the different steps (mobilization, homing, and differentiation) of EPC trafficking from the bone marrow to the tumor site.

Whereas the processes controlling VEGF expression are well described, the mechanisms underlying VEGFR-2 upregulation have remained unclear. We found that endothelial VEGFR-2 expression is strongly reduced in the absence of the G protein G13, resulting in an impaired responsiveness to VEGF-A, a phenotype that can be rescued by normalization of VEGFR-2 levels. G13-mediated VEGFR-2 expression involved activation of the small GTPase RhoA and transcription factor NF-\u03baB, the latter acting via a specific binding site at position -84 of the VEGFR-2 promoter. Mice with endothelial cell-specific loss of G13 showed reduced VEGFR-2 expression at sites of angiogenesis and attenuated VEGF effects, resulting in impaired retinal angiogenesis and tumor vascularization.

These specialized cells form a polarized monolayer that acts as the retinal-blood barrier, separating two distinct environments with highly specialized functions: photoreceptors of the neuroretina at the apical side and Bruch's membrane/highly vascularized choriocapillaris at the basal side. The polarized nature of the RPE is essential for the health of these two regions, not only in nutrient and waste transport but also in the synthesis and directional secretion of proteins required in maintaining retinal homoeostasis and function. Although multiple malfunctions within the RPE cells have been associated with development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of legal blindness, clear causative processes have not yet been conclusively characterized at the molecular and cellular level.

{"title": "Development of the pulmonary vasculature: Current understanding and concepts for the future.", "abstract": "The pulmonary circulation is a highly specialized vascular bed that physically and functionally connects the heart and the lungs. The interdependence of these two organs is illustrated in embryonic development, when the lung endoderm protrudes into the surrounding mesoderm as the heart tube elongates and folds into structurally distinct chambers. The pulmonary vascular precursors then undergo highly stereotyped cellular maturation and patterning to form a multilayered vascular network that parallels the airways and links the arterial and venous poles of the heart. Upon the first breath, the mature pulmonary circulation is poised to receive the entire cardiac output for efficient gas exchange, and deliver oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation. Disruption of this developmental process can result in congenital defects such as the syndrome tetralogy of Fallot, or differentiation defects leading to persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Prior studies into the role of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in pulmonary vascular development have not clearly yielded the identity of pulmonary vascular precursors, or the signals coordinating vascular maturation.

The localized and sustained codelivery of AT and FA indicated significantly high cell viability and secretion of extracellular matrices for both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and induced significantly high densities of vascular structures after subcutaneous implantation. The most significant angiogenesis promotion with few inflammatory reactions was demonstrated for electrospun fibers containing AT and FA with the ratio of 7/3.

Establishing new blood supply is a fundamental requirement for endometriosis lesion growth. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), recruited by stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), contribute to neoangiogenesis in endometriotic lesions. We hypothesized that SDF-1 is central to the neoangiogenesis and survival of endometriotic lesions, and blocking of SDF-1 will reduce vascularization of lesions in a mouse model.\nUsing immunohistochemistry, we evaluated SDF-1 and CD34(+) EPCs in human endometriotic lesions and normal endometrium samples. EPCs were co-localized using CD34 and VEGFR2. Effects of SDF-1 blocking on endometriotic lesion survival were assessed in BALB/c-Rag2(-/-) /IL2r\u03b3(-/-) mice engrafted with human endometrium and treated with SDF-1-blocking antibody or an isotype control. Weekly blood samples from experimental mice were analyzed for cytokines and EPCs.\nSDF-1 and CD34(+) EPCs were abundant in human endometriotic lesions compared with eutopic endometrium.

A significant increase in the volume of extravascular fluid drained as well as the number of ECM drainage voxels was detected in MCF-7-VEGF tumors relative to MCF-7 tumors, but not in MDA-MB-231-VEGF versus MDA-MB-231 tumors. The angiogenic effects of VEGF overexpression in both MCF-7-VEGF and MDA-MB-231-VEGF tumors were validated histologically. MCF-7-VEGF tumors exhibited enhanced invasion and a greater fraction of cancer positive lungs and lymph nodes relative to MCF-7 tumors.\nIn vivo MRI and histological data demonstrate that VEGF overexpression results in the progression of noninvasive MCF-7 and invasive MDA-MB-321 tumors to a more angiogenic phenotype. However, VEGF overexpression significantly altered ECM integrity only in MCF-7 tumors, causing them to progress to an invasive and metastatic phenotype.

The ability of tumor TEMs to suppress tumor-specific T-cell response mediated by tumor dendritic cells (DC) was measured in vitro. Characterization of TEM and DC phenotype in addition to their interaction with T cells was done using confocal microscopic images analysis of breast carcinomas.\nTEMs from breast tumors are able to suppress tumor-specific immune responses. Importantly, proangiogenic and suppressive functions of TEMs are similarly driven by TIE-2 and VEGFR kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that tumor TEMs can function as antigen-presenting cells and elicit a weak proliferation of T cells. Blocking TIE-2 and VEGFR kinase activity induced TEMs to change their phenotype into cells with features of myeloid dendritic cells. We show that immunosuppressive activity of TEMs is associated with high CD86 surface expression and extensive engagement of T regulatory cells in breast tumors. TIE-2 and VEGFR kinase activity was also necessary to maintain high CD86 surface expression levels and to convert T cells into regulatory cells.\nThese results suggest that TEMs are plastic cells that can be reverted from suppressive, proangiogenic cells into cells that are able to mediate an antitumoral immune response.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2013-05-08", "authors": ["MarkIbberson", "SylvianBron", "NicolasGuex", "EvelineFaes-van't Hull", "AssiaIfticene-Treboux", "LucHenry", "Hans-AntonLehr", "Jean-Fran\u00e7oisDelaloye", "GeorgeCoukos", "IoannisXenarios", "Marie-Agn\u00e8sDoucey"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3181"}

This study was designed to functionally characterize membrane currents of CD117(pos) cells under normal and AT2 R-stimulated conditions.\nCD117(pos) murine bone marrow stem cells were isolated with MACS technique and stimulated for the AT2 R with angiotensin II and losartan for 3-5\u00a0days prior to patch-clamp measurements. RT-PCR was used to determine channel expression. Endothelial properties were analysed with immunocytochemistry and acLDL uptake assay.\nA well-expressed inward rectifying current (IKir ) was identified in cultured CD117(pos) cells. Furthermore, a ZD 7288 (HCN channel blocker)-sensitive current component was isolated. Voltage-dependent potassium currents and chloride currents were less expressed.

Metastases are the leading causes of death as a result of this tumor. They represent a major problem for obstetrics and for the public health system. To date, there is no predictor of the progression of molar pregnancies to gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTT). Only an unfavorable plasma hCG monitoring after evacuation of hydatidiform mole is used to diagnose a TTG. The causes of the development of this cancer are still poorly understood. Increasing data in the literature suggests a close association between the development of this tumor and poor placental vascularization during the first trimester of pregnancy. The development of the human placenta depends on a coordination between the trophoblast and endothelial cells. A disruption in the expression of angiogenic factors could contribute to uterine or extra-uterine tissue invasion by extravillous trophoblast, contributing to the development of TTG. This review sheds lights on the phenomenon of angiogenesis during normal and abnormal placentation, especially during the MGT and reports preliminary finding concerning, the variability of expression of \"Endocrine Gland-Derived Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\" (EG-VEGF), a specific placental angiogenic factor, in normal and molar placentas, and the potential role of differentiated expressions of the main placental angiogenic factors in the scalability of hydatidiform moles towards a recovery or towards the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor.

This dual targeting system demonstrated a great binding affinity to hydroxyapatite, a model component of bone minerals, and higher cell uptake (in the form of carriers but not drug) and cytotoxicity in the K562 cell line, a leukemia cell line with overexpressed folate receptors, were observed in vitro compared to unmodified carriers, especially when the cells were pretreated and the receptors were up-regulated by all-trans retinoic acid. The comodel test of K562 cells and HA showed that this dual targeting system could desorb from bone surface and be taken up by leukemia cells. For the in vivo study, this dual targeting system exhibited a significant increase in plasma half-life and could specifically accumulate in the bone tissue of rats or mice after intravenous injection. Ex vivo imaging of mice femurs and confocal laser scanning microscope imaging of mice femur slices further confirmed that this dual targeting system could favorably deposit to the osteoblast-enriched areas of high bone turnover in regions of trabecular bone surrounded by red marrow. In vivo antitumor activity in K562/BALB/c-nu leukemia mice showed that the treatment of this dual targeting system significantly reduced the white blood cell (WBC) number in peripheral blood and bone marrow to the normal level.

{"title": "The pivotal role of vascularization in tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Vascularization is one of the great challenges that tissue engineering faces in order to achieve sizeable tissue and organ substitutes that contain living cells. There are instances, such as skin replacement, in which a tissue-engineered substitute does not absolutely need a preexisting vascularization. However, tissue or organ substitutes in which any dimension, such as thickness, exceeds 400 \u03bcm need to be vascularized to ensure cellular survival. Consistent with the wide spectrum of approaches to tissue engineering itself, which vary from acellular synthetic biomaterials to purely biological living constructs, approaches to tissue-engineered vascularization cover numerous techniques. Those techniques range from micropatterns engineered in biomaterials to microvascular networks created by endothelial cells. In this review, we strive to provide a critical overview of the elements that must be considered in the pursuit of this goal and the major approaches that are investigated in hopes of achieving it.", "journal": "Annual review of biomedical engineering", "date": "2013-05-07", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois AAuger", "LaureGibot", "DanLacroix"], "doi": "10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071812-152428"}
{"title": "The role of the anterolateral thigh flap in complex defects of the scalp and cranium.", "abstract": "In this study, we introduced scalp reconstruction using free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps and evaluated postoperative outcomes in nine patients between March 2000 and April 2012. Five patients had problems of exposed prosthesis, three required reconstruction after resection of scalp tumor and one patient presented with third degree flame burns of the scalp. All flaps survived without re-exploration, except three flaps with tip necrosis requiring secondary procedures of debridement and small Z-plasty reconstructions. The superficial temporal artery and its concomitant vein were used as recipient vessels, apart from two cases where previous surgery and flame burns excluded these choices, for which facial arteries and veins were used instead. Primary closure of the donor-site was possible in six cases; with skin grafting performed for the other three patients. All donor sites healed without complications. The ALT flap offers the advantage of customizable size, option of fascia lata as vascularized dural replacement, and minimal flap atrophy typical of muscle flaps. Indications include very large defects, defects with exposed prosthesis, or defects with bone or dural loss. Our experience lends credible support to the use of customized free ALT flaps to achieve functional and cosmetically superior result for the reconstruction of large scalp defects, especially with bone exposure.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2013-05-04", "authors": ["Pao-YuanLin", "RosMiguel", "Khong-YikChew", "Yur-RenKuo", "Johnson Chia-ShenYang"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22103"}

However, current biomaterials-assisted constructions of miniaturized 3D cellular microenvironments usually involve cells in the microfabrication process, limiting their wide application in most biomedical labs, where expertise and facilities are not readily available. Here we tackle this challenge by developing off-the-shelf microsponge arrays as pre-formed micro-patterned templates which can separate the microfabrication steps from the cell-handling steps and miniaturize the cell-based assays. The microsponge arrays with tailored microarchitectures (e.g. micropillar/well arrays or bifurcated vascular network) could be stored and delivered to distant locations as ready-to-use chips. The highly porous and microscale sponges enabled automatic and uniform loading of cellular niche components (cells, matrices and soluble factors) by simply pipetting, making it accessible to any lab with basic cell culture setups. Meanwhile, the chips containing miniaturized 3D cellular microenvironments with versatile micro-architectural designs could be integrated (i.e. by autoloading and sandwiching) to enable novel 3D cell-based assays (e.g. discrete gradient-based cytotoxicity test and horizontal 3D invasion assay) in an efficient and parallel manner.

To test whether loss of Cav1 accelerates tumorigenesis, we generated a novel mouse model of CRC by crossing C57BL/6 Apc(min/+) with B6129 Cav1 knockout (Cav1-/-) mice. Apc(min/+) Cav1-/- mice developed large, microinvasive and vascularized intraepithelial adenocarcinomas in the distal colon and rectum with higher incidence than Apc(min/+) Cav1+/- and Apc(min/+) Cav1+/+ littermates. Intratumoral gene signatures related to Ras and wingless signaling were elevated, nuclear localization of PPARg protein and expression of PPARg-target genes were reduced independently of Cav1. The PPARg-agonist rosiglitazone prevented tumor formation in mice irrespectively of the Cav1 status and upregulated expression of the Ras-inhibitory protein docking protein-1.

These patient xenograft models are becoming widely used for therapeutic efficacy studies. Because many therapies are directed at tumor stromal components and because the tumor microenvironment also is known to influence the response of a tumor to therapy, it is important to understand the nature of the stroma and, in particular, the vascular supply of patient xenografts.\nPatient tumor xenografts were established by implanting undisrupted pieces of patient tumors in SCID mice. For this study, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens from several types of solid tumors were selected and, using species-specific antibodies which react with formalin fixed antigens, we analyzed the species origin of the stroma and blood vessels that supported tumor growth in these models. Additionally, we investigated the kinetics of the vascularization process in a colon tumor and a mesothelioma xenograft. In mice bearing a head and neck xenograft, a perfusion study was performed to compare the functionality of the human and mouse tumor vessels.\nIn patient tumors which successfully engrafted, the human stroma and vessels which were engrafted as part of the original tumor did not survive and were no longer detectable at the time of first passage (15-25 weeks). Uniformly, the stroma and vessels supporting the growth of these tumors were of murine origin. The results of the kinetic studies showed that the loss of the human vessels and vascularization by host vessels occurred more rapidly in a colon tumor (by 3 weeks) than in a mesothelioma (by 9 weeks). Finally, the perfusion studies revealed that while mouse vessels in the periphery of the tumor were perfused, those in the central regions were rarely perfused.

{"title": "Tumor type-specific and skin region-selective metastasis of human cancers: another example of the \"seed and soil\" hypothesis.", "abstract": "Metastasis of human cancer is an organ-selective process that is determined by anatomical and biological factors as well as by specific microenvironmental properties. Dissemination of visceral malignancies to the skin is rather rare and usually occurs in a later stage of the disease. Using statistical approaches, both positive (renal and lung cancers) and negative (pancreatic and liver cancers) organ preferences can be identified in a variety of cancers. While certain cancer types are characterized by random distribution for skin metastasis (liver cancer), a number of cancers demonstrate a colonization preference to the region of origin: lung cancer to the supradiaphragmatic (mostly chest) and colorectal cancers to the infradiaphragmatic (abdominal) skin regions. In certain cases, however, skin metastasis develops more frequently at specific distant locations, as evidenced by the dissemination of renal cancer at the head and neck region. These findings are clinically relevant and useful especially in patients where skin metastasis is the first indication of a malignancy. Nevertheless, it is a strong argument for the predominant role of microenvironmental factors in cancer dissemination. On the other hand, skin metastases of visceral cancers provide a unique model to analyze the pathomechanisms determining organ selectivity, including the organ-specific vascularization, the dermatome-specific innervation, or immunological and developmental factors.", "journal": "Cancer metastasis reviews", "date": "2013-05-03", "authors": ["K AKov\u00e1cs", "BHegedus", "IKenessey", "JT\u00edm\u00e1r"], "doi": "10.1007/s10555-013-9418-8"}

A patient affected by a hystiocytic sarcoma localized on the VI-V and IVa segments was scheduled for liver resection. During the resection a diffuse bleeding from the resected surface started with little success obtained with conventional method. So we decided to use the coagulative necrosis generated by the radiofrequency, using a cool type cluster needle, hand-piece with 3 needle, bending 2 needles in a way resembling a \"fork\", to reach a complete and definitive haemostasis.\nHaemostasis remains a critical issue in liver surgery not only for the catastrophic effect of haemorrhage but also because it is correlated to complications rate and to survival. The coagulative necrosis generated by the radiofrequency could be used to facilitate the creation of a necrotic plane to be transacted.\nThe use of the radiofrequency energy, delivered through needles, is suggested when the conventional techniques fail to reach a proper haemostasis after a liver resection or, to consider its use, prior to resect the liver in presence of fragile parenchyma.", "journal": "International journal of surgery case reports", "date": "2013-05-02", "authors": ["BenedettaPesi", "FrancescaLeo", "GadielLiscia", "GiovanniAlemanno", "DanielaZambonin", "MassimoFalchini", "GiacomoBatignani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.02.021"}

To determine if islet vascularization changes in response to insulin resistance, we investigated three independent models of insulin resistance: ob/ob, GLUT4(+/-), and mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity. Intravital blood vessel labeling and immunocytochemistry revealed a vascular plasticity in which islet vessel area was significantly increased, but intraislet vessel density was decreased as the result of insulin resistance. These vascular changes were independent of islet size and were only observed within the \u03b2-cell core but not in the islet periphery. Intraislet endothelial cell fenestration, proliferation, and islet angiogenic factor/receptor expression were unchanged in insulin-resistant compared with control mice, indicating that islet capillary expansion is mediated by dilation of preexisting vessels and not by angiogenesis. We propose that the islet capillary dilation is modulated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase via complementary signals derived from \u03b2-cells, parasympathetic nerves, and increased islet blood flow.

We now show in a syngeneic colorectal carcinoma murine model that both tumor and tumor-associated cells contribute cathepsin S to promote neovascularization and tumor growth. Cathepsin S depleted and control colorectal MC38 tumor cell lines were propagated in both wild type C57Bl/6 and cathepsin S null mice to provide stratified depletion of the protease from either the tumor, tumor-associated host cells, or both. Parallel analysis of these conditions showed that deletion of cathepsin S inhibited tumor growth and development, and revealed a clear contribution of both tumor and tumor-associated cell derived cathepsin S. The most significant impact on tumor development was obtained when the protease was depleted from both sources. Further characterization revealed that the loss of cathepsin S led to impaired tumor vascularization, which was complemented by a reduction in proliferation and increased apoptosis, consistent with reduced tumor growth. Analysis of cell types showed that in addition to the tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells can produce cathepsin S within the microenvironment.

{"title": "[The technique of sleeve resection on the bronchial and pulmonary vascular tree].", "abstract": "Sleeve resections of the lungs have affected the oncologic radicality, parenchyma and lung function-saving resections and extended the indications for operations in thoracic surgery. Whenever lung amputations can be avoided by bronchoplastic and/or angioplastic procedures with the same radicality, sleeve resection should be performed. In centrally located distinct malignomas, intraluminal tumor growth (T3) infiltrations of peribronchial or extrabronchial areas, the lobular ostia and the pulmonary artery (T2/T3) as well as lymph node involvement (N1/N2), these procedures give a better qualitative survival and lower morbidity and mortality rates. Broncoscope-guided localization of a double lumen tube and routine anesthesia monitoring are mandatory. Before performing sleeve resections a complete lymph node dissection should be done without denuding the area of the anastomosis and sparing the bronchial arteries. Preoperative endoscopic biopsies, knowledge of the topography and mobilization of the vascular and bronchial tree, subtile operation techniques, perioperative and postoperative videobronchoscopic guidance as well as intraoperative frozen sections and a tension-free and smooth anastomosis, avoid postoperative complications. Depending on the blood supply of the bronchial tree a vascularized flap is indicated. Operability can therefore be achieved in elderly patients with limited pulmonary function, particularly those under adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy who are no longer suitable for pneumonectomy.", "journal": "Der Chirurg; Zeitschrift fur alle Gebiete der operativen Medizen", "date": "2013-04-30", "authors": ["DBranscheid", "MBeshay"], "doi": "10.1007/s00104-012-2428-1"}

The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate feasibility to distinguish different entities of submandibular gland disease including inflammatory alterations of the submandibular gland as well as benign and malignant tumors. In this prospective clinical study, ITGs in 30 patients with sialolithiasis-related chronic sialadenitis or an unilateral submandibular mass and 18 disease-free submandibular gland controls were quantitatively analyzed by CEUS using the contrast agent SonoVue. In addition, clinical complaints according to visual analog scales (VAS) were documented. VAS data documented significantly less complaints only in benign tumors compared with the other pathologies of the submandibular gland. In parallel, CEUS-derived ITGs revealed significantly reduced ITGs only in benign tumors (n = 5) compared to the controls (n = 18). Despite of comparably reduced wash-in velocities in malignant lesions (n = 3) statistical significance was not reached. Chronic sialadenitis (n = 18) and its sclerosing variant (K\u00fcttner tumor, n = 4) revealed comparable ITGs as controls. Tumors of the submandibular gland present with reduced functional microcirculatory networks comparing with healthy gland controls and chronically inflamed submandibular glands.

Visualizing the 3-D vascular network in the lungs may provide new opportunities for detecting and monitoring lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Our CDOCT instrument employs a rotary fiber-optic probe that provides simultaneous two-dimensional (2-D) real-time structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and CDOCT imaging at frame rates up to 12.5 frames per second. Controlled pullback of the probe allows 3-D vascular mapping in airway segments up to 50 mm in length in a single acquisition. We demonstrate the ability of CDOCT to map both small and large vessels. In one example, CDOCT imaging allows assignment of a feature in the structural OCT image as a large (\u223c1\u2009 mm diameter) blood vessel.

However, the clinical prognosis of metastatic CRCs is still poor, and novel drugs are currently assessed with respect to their efficacies in patients with CRCs. In a phase III study, the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) has recently been shown to prolong survival of patients with CRCs after standard therapies failed. In the present study, the activity of regorafenib was investigated in comparison with the angiogenesis inhibitor DC101 in the highly aggressive, murine CT26 metastatic colon cancer model. While a treatment for 10 days with DC101 given at a dose of 34 mg/kg every third day significantly delayed tumor growth compared with vehicle-treated animals, regorafenib completely suppressed tumor growth at a daily oral dose of 30 mg/kg. Regorafenib also induced a stronger reduction in tumor vascularization, as longitudinally assessed in vivo by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, regorafenib inhibited the angiogenic activity more strongly and induced a three times higher apoptosis rate than DC101. Even more important, regorafenib completely prevented the formation of liver metastases, whereas in DC101-treated animals, the metastatic rate was only reduced by 33% compared with the vehicle group. In addition, regorafenib significantly reduced the amount of infiltrating macrophages.

Individual vascular particularities can influence or even oblige the surgeon to choose a certain procedure.

{"title": "Vascular-targeted therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.", "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy and an X-linked recessive, progressive muscle wasting disease caused by the absence of a functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin has a structural role as a cytoskeletal stabilization protein and protects cells against contraction-induced damage. Dystrophin also serves a signaling role through mechanotransduction of forces and localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produces nitric oxide (NO) to facilitate vasorelaxation. In DMD, the signaling defects produce inadequate tissue perfusion caused by functional ischemia due to a diminished ability to respond to shear stress induced endothelium-dependent dilation. Additionally, the structural defects seen in DMD render myocytes with an increased susceptibility to mechanical stress. The combination of both defects is necessary to generate myocyte damage, which induces successive rounds of myofiber degeneration and regeneration, loss of calcium homeostasis, chronic inflammatory response, fibrosis, and myonecrosis. In individuals with DMD, these processes inevitably cause loss of ambulation shortly after the first decade and an abbreviated life with death in the third or fourth decade due to cardio-respiratory anomalies. There is no known cure for DMD, and although the culpable gene has been identified for more than twenty years, research on treatments has produced few clinically relevant results. Several recent studies on novel DMD therapeutics are vascular targeted and focused on attenuating the inherent functional ischemia. One approach improves vasorelaxation capacity through pharmaceutical inhibition of either phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Another approach increases the density of the underlying vascular network by inducing angiogenesis, and this has been accomplished through either direct delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or by downregulating the VEGF decoy-receptor type 1 (VEGFR-1 or Flt-1). The pro-angiogenic approaches also seem to be pro-myogenic and could resolve the age-related decline in satellite cell (SC) quantity seen in mdx models through expansion of the SC juxtavascular niche.

Here, we investigated whether HMOX1 can modulate microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulate human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) development.\nStable HMOX1 overexpression in NSCLC NCI-H292 cells up-regulated tumor-suppressive miRNAs, whereas it significantly diminished the expression of oncomirs and angiomirs. The most potently down-regulated was miR-378. HMOX1 also up-regulated p53, down-regulated angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and mucin-5AC (MUC5AC), reduced proliferation, migration, and diminished angiogenic potential. Carbon monoxide was a mediator of HMOX1 effects on proliferation, migration, and miR-378 expression. In contrast, stable miR-378 overexpression decreased HMOX1 and p53; while enhanced expression of MUC5AC, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and Ang-1, and consequently increased proliferation, migration, and stimulation of endothelial cells. Adenoviral delivery of HMOX1 reversed miR-378 effect on the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. In vivo, HMOX1 overexpressing tumors were smaller, less vascularized and oxygenated, and less metastatic. Overexpression of miR-378 exerted opposite effects. Accordingly, in patients with NSCLC, HMOX1 expression was lower in metastases to lymph nodes than in primary tumors.\nIn vitro and in vivo data indicate that the interplay between HMOX1 and miR-378 significantly modulates NSCLC progression and angiogenesis, suggesting miR-378 as a new therapeutic target.

In this study, we constructed cartilage using a two-step procedure: first, promoting complete chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs in 8 weeks, and second, these chondrocytes which differentiated from BMSCs in vitro were provided with a three-dimensional scaffold, which was then implanted subcutaneously. The results indicate that this two-step construction procedure can promote the full chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro and the formation of mature ectopic cartilage by BMSCs in vivo.", "journal": "Cells, tissues, organs", "date": "2013-04-26", "authors": ["KeXue", "LinQi", "GuangdongZhou", "KaiLiu"], "doi": "10.1159/000347238"}

We explore the links between functional aspects of seed germination and the number and location of the cotyledons, using as a model the early-divergent angiosperm family Hydatellaceae, in which seedlings are superficially monocot-like. \u2022\nSeedlings of two species of tropical Hydatellaceae were studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. \u2022\nSeedlings of Trithuria cowieana bear two free cotyledons. Each cotyledon possesses a green, filiform, vascularized blade that resembles subsequent leaves, and a basal, nonvascularized, haustorial outgrowth that remains in close contact with the endosperm. Seedlings of Trithuria konkanensis have two free cotyledonary haustoria inserted close to each other and a leaf blade probably belonging to one of the cotyledons. The cotyledonary node elongates between the haustoria and the leaf blade to form a mesocotyl. \u2022\nTo date, the absence or presence of a cotyledonary tube represents the only known qualitative morphological difference between the two major clades of Hydatellaceae. Cotyledons with a haustorium and leaf blade are unusual at the scale of seed plants and probably evolved due to homeosis. The mesocotyl of T. konkanensis resembles that of grasses and sedges.

In this study, we examine whether this slow growth rate also occurs in the more basal stegosaur Kentrosaurus from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania. The bone histology of six femora of Kentrosaurus representing an ontogenetic series from subadult to adult was studied, as well as one scapula. The primary bone is mainly highly vascularized fibro-lamellar bone with some reticular organization of the vascular canals. In addition to LAGs and annuli, distinctive shifts in the pattern of vascularization occur, which have been interpreted as potential growth marks. The variation in the development of growth marks may reflect annual climatic fluctuations. The overall bone depositional rate, and hence growth rate in Kentrosaurus appears to be higher than in Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus. Considering that Stegosaurus is the larger-sized of the two stegosaurs, this would be contrary to an earlier supposition that small-bodied dinosaurs have slower growth rates than larger ones. Our finding of rapid rates of bone deposition in Kentrosaurus suggests that slow growth rates previously reported in Scutellosaurus and Stegosaurus are not a phylogenetic characteristic of the Thyreophora. Thus, slow growth rates are not plesiomorphic for the Thyreophora. We propose that the slow growth rates documented in the highly derived Stegosaurus could have been secondarily derived or alternatively that Kentrosaurus is the exception having increased growth rates.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2013-04-25", "authors": ["RagnaRedelstorff", "Tom RH\u00fcbner", "AnusuyaChinsamy", "P MartinSander"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.22701"}

{"title": "Angiogenic factors in bone local environment.", "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays an important role in physiological bone growth and remodeling, as well as in pathological bone disorders such as fracture repair, osteonecrosis, and tumor metastasis to bone. Vascularization is required for bone remodeling along the endosteal surface of trabecular bone or Haversian canals within the cortical bone, as well as the homeostasis of the cartilage-subchondral bone interface. Angiogenic factors, produced by cells from a basic multicellular unit (BMU) within the bone remodeling compartment (BRC) regulate local endothelial cells and pericytes. In this review, we discuss the expression and function of angiogenic factors produced by osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes in the BMU and in the cartilage-subchondral bone interface. These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), BMP7, receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like family members. In addition, the expression of EGFL2, EGFL3, EGFL5, EGFL6, EGFL7, EGFL8 and EGFL9 has been recently identified in the bone local environment, giving important clues to their possible roles in angiogenesis.

{"title": "Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of discogenic low back pain.", "abstract": "Discogenic low back pain is a serious medical and social problem, and accounts for 26%-42% of the patients with chronic low back pain. Recent studies found that the pathologic features of discs obtained from the patients with discogenic low back pain were the formation of the zones of vascularized granulation tissue, with extensive innervation in fissures extending from the outer part of the annulus into the nucleus pulposus. Studies suggested that the degeneration of the painful disc might originate from the injury and subsequent repair of annulus fibrosus. Growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor \u03b21, and connective tissue growth factor, macrophages and mast cells might play a key role in the repair of the injured annulus fibrosus and subsequent disc degeneration. Although there exist controversies about the role of discography as a diagnostic test, provocation discography still is the only available means by which to identify a painful disc. A recent study has classified discogenic low back pain into two types that were annular disruption-induced low back pain and internal endplate disruption-induced low back pain, which have been fully supported by clinical and theoretical bases. Current treatment options for discogenic back pain range from medicinal anti-inflammation strategy to invasive procedures including spine fusion and recently spinal arthroplasty. However, these treatments are limited to relieving symptoms, with no attempt to restore the disc's structure.

{"title": "Burnei's technique in the treatment of radial head displacement; innovative surgery. Study on two cases.", "abstract": "Dislocation of the radial head, congenital or traumatic, anteriorly, posteriorly or laterally displaced, requires surgery to reseat and stabilize the head of the radius within the joint, in order to restore elbow flexion and, as much as possible, pronation-supination.\nThis article is meant to present the technique of proximal radial-ulnar ligament plasty using the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) tendon, as well as other techniques for the stabilization of a dislocated radial head. The ECRL tendon technique, quadrate and annular ligament reconstruction variant was first used by Gh. Burnei in 1985, at Mangalia Municipal Hospital, Romania.\nThis study contains two clinical cases, a 6-year-old girl with congenital dislocation of the radial head, and a 10-year-old boy with traumatic dislocation of the radial head, both of whom were treated by open reduction and stabilization of the dislocation with the ECRL tendon, using the Burnei procedure.\nIn both cases, the operation was successful in the reduction and stabilization of the dislocated radial head, whose position was maintained in flexion-extension and pronation-supination, and in the reconstruction of the annular ligament using Burnei's procedure, variant 2. Postoperatively, the clinical evolution was good, the patients having regained elbow mobility. The child with congenital dislocation exhibits normal flexion and pronation-supination within normal range, and the traumatic dislocation also exhibits normal flexion and pronation-supination limited with 20 degrees. Radiologically, in both cases the radial head is anatomically placed relatively to the humeral capitellum, in both flexion and extension.\nStabilization of the radial head in traumatic or congenital dislocation can only be surgically achieved. Congenital dislocation of the radial head requires the reconstruction of the proximal radial-ulnar joint, preferably at a young age, in order to avoid subsequent complications, culminating in ulnar or radial nerve paralysis. Traumatic dislocation of the radial head is usually accompanied by the fracture of the ulna, but may be encountered in isolation.\nThe Burnei procedure is an alternative for the treatment of radial head dislocation and is advantageous because of the use of a study, well vascularized tendon, which allows, when needed, the complete reconstruction of the proximal radial-ulnar ligaments, or just the annular ligament, in order to stabilize the head of the radius within the elbow joint.

These vessels became perfused with host blood as early as 3 d post implantation and became progressively more mature through 28 d. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the neovessels were composed of human and mouse endothelial cells and exhibited a mature phenotype, as indicated by the presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive pericytes. Implantation of cords with a prescribed geometry demonstrated that they provided a template that defined the neovascular architecture in vivo. To explore the utility of this geometric control, we implanted primary rat and human hepatocyte constructs containing randomly organized endothelial networks vs. ordered cords. We found substantially enhanced hepatic survival and function in the constructs containing ordered cords following transplantation in mice.

Structural and functional parameters of mitochondria were analyzed in tissue samples taken from the left ventricle ischemic area at the end of the experiment. I/R induced expected effects, namely accelerated HR, decreased dMAP and LV dP/dt max, and altered mitochondrial structural and functional parameters including decreased oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and reduced calcium retention capacity resulting in the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP). Ranolazine and propranolol administered either alone or combined prior to I/R significantly decreased all of these deleterious consequences.

However, evidence supporting their mechanism of action is scanty. This work provides first results from a preclinical swine model of excisional wounds, elucidating the mechanism of action of a modified collagen gel (MCG) dressing. Following wounding, wound-edge tissue was collected at specific time intervals (3, 7, 14, and 21 days postwounding). On day 7, histological analysis showed significant increase in the length of rete ridges, suggesting improved biomechanical properties of the healing wound tissue. Rapid and transient mounting of inflammation is necessary for efficient healing. MCG significantly accelerated neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the wound site on day 3 and day 7 with successful resolution of inflammation on day 21. MCG induced monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in neutrophil-like human promyelocytic leukemia-60 cells in vitro. In vivo, MCG-treated wound tissue displayed elevated vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Consistently, MCG-treated wounds displayed significantly higher abundance of endothelial cells with increased blood flow to the wound area indicating improved vascularization. This observation was explained by the finding that MCG enhanced proliferation of wound-site endothelial cells. In MCG-treated wound tissue, Masson's trichrome and picrosirius red staining showed higher abundance of collagen and increased collagen type I:III ratio.

Endocan is naturally expressed by endothelial cells, highly regulated in presence of proinflammatory and proangiogenic molecules, binds to matrix proteins, growth factors, integrin, and cells, and may be then considered as an accurate marker of endothelial activation. Consequently, Endocan expression has been associated with a growing number of pathological conditions where endothelium gets challenged and notably in highly vascularized cancers. In this context, Endocan has indeed been rapidly emerging as a promising tissue- and blood-based marker of the vascular growth and neoangiogenesis during cancer progression. Furthermore, very recent studies have reported an expression of Endocan by the tumor cells themselves. This highlights Endocan as a multifaceted molecule with a great interest for researchers and clinicians to better understand tumor development, from the bench to the clinics.

Our novel data, however, document that patients with RA and greater disease activity have higher levels of IL-7, IL-7R, and TNF-\u03b1 in RA monocytes, suggesting a feedback regulation between IL-7/IL-7R and TNF-\u03b1 cascades in myeloid cells that is linked to chronic disease progression. Investigations into the involved mechanism showed that IL-7 is a novel and potent chemoattractant that attracts IL-7R(+) monocytes through activation of the PI3K/AKT1 and ERK pathways at similar concentrations of IL-7 detected in RA synovial fluid. To determine whether ligation of IL-7 to IL-7R is a potential target for RA treatment and to identify their mechanism of action, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was therapeutically treated with anti-IL-7 Ab or IgG control. Anti-IL-7 Ab treatment significantly reduces CIA monocyte recruitment and osteoclast differentiation as well as potent joint monocyte chemoattractants and bone erosion markers, suggesting that both direct and indirect pathways might contribute to the observed effect. We also demonstrate that reduction in joint MIP-2 levels is responsible for suppressed vascularization detected in mice treated with anti-IL-7 Ab compared with the control group. To our knowledge, we show for the first time that expression of IL-7/IL-7R in myeloid cells is strongly correlated with RA disease activity and that ligation of IL-7 to IL-7R contributes to monocyte homing, differentiation of osteoclasts, and vascularization in the CIA effector phase.", "journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "date": "2013-04-23", "authors": ["ZhenlongChen", "Seung-jaeKim", "Nathan DChamberlain", "Sarah RPickens", "Michael VVolin", "SuncicaVolkov", "ShivaArami", "John WChristman", "Bellur SPrabhakar", "WilliamSwedler", "AnjaliMehta", "NaderaSweiss", "ShivaShahrara"], "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.1201675"}

X-ray, histological examination, biomechanics analysis, and micro-angiography were conducted 4, 8, and 12 weeks later to determine angiogenesis and osteogenesis. The volume and speed of production of newly formed bones in Group A were significantly superior to those in other groups, and de-novo vascular network circulation from the vessel bundle through newly formed bone tissue was observed, with the defect being completely repaired. Group B showed a slightly better effect in terms of speed and quality of bone formation than Group C, whereas the bone defect in Group D was replaced by fibrous tissue. The maximal anti-bending strength in Group A was significantly higher than that in the other groups. Runx II gene therapy combined with vascular bundle implantation thus displays excellent abilities for osteoinduction and vascularization and is a promising method for the treatment of bone non-union and defect.", "journal": "Cell and tissue research", "date": "2013-04-23", "authors": ["DongHan", "JianjunLi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00441-013-1595-9"}

A few studies that help guide the treatment of forearm nonunion have been reported. We offer a novel surgical technique to treat nonunion of the forearm using a regional vascularized bone graft.\nFour females and 5 males ranging from 27 to 74 years of age with 7 ulna and 2 radius nonunions were surgically treated by pedicle grafting with a posterior interosseous bone flap (PIBF) and internal fixation with a plate. There were no cases with extensive soft tissue damage or infection. Pre- and postoperatively (mean 21 months), all patients were assessed by radiographs and for function by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score.\nFunction of the upper extremity was improved in all patients. DASH scores improved from 61.2 points pre-operatively to 12 points at final follow-up. All nonunions were united uneventfully.\nFollowing debridement of the necrotic tissue, the bone defect can be filled with a vascularized graft from posterior interosseous pedicles.

{"title": "Beautiful, complicated--and intelligent? Novel aspects of the thigmonastic stamen movement in Loasaceae.", "abstract": "In a recent study we investigated the complex mechanisms regulating the pollen release via thigmonastic stamen movement found exclusively in Loasaceae subfamily Loasoideae. We demonstrated that stamen movement is modulated by abiotic (light and temperature) as well as biotic stimuli (pollinator availability and visitation frequency). This is explained as a mechanism to adjust the rate of stamen movement and thus pollen dispensation to different environmental conditions in order to optimize pollen transfer. Stamen movement is rapid and thus a near-immediate response to pollinator visits. However, Loasaceae flowers also show a response to biotic stimuli on a longer time scale, by adjusting the duration of both the staminate and the carpellate phase of the anthesis. We here present two additional data sets on species not previously studied, underscoring the shortening of the staminate phase in the presence of pollinator visits vs. their absence and the shortening of the carpellate phase after pollination. Overall, the plant shows not only a rapid but an \"intelligent\" reaction to its environment in adjusting anthesis and pollen presentation to a range of factors. The physiological and morphological bases of the stamen movement are poorly understood. Our previous study showed that there is no direct spatial relationship between the place of stimulation in the flower and the stamen bundle activated. We here further show the morphological basis for stamen movement from a reflexed into an erect position: Only the basal part of the filament curves around the receptacle, while the upper part of the filament retains its shape. We hypothesize that the stimulus is transmitted over the entire receptacle and the place of reaction is determined by stamen maturity, not the location of the stimulus.", "journal": "Plant signaling & behavior", "date": "2013-04-23", "authors": ["TiloHenning", "MaximilianWeigend"], "doi": "10.4161/psb.24605\n10.2307/2408071\n10.1086/284922\n10.1046/j.1442-1984.2000.00026.x\n10.1663/0006-8101(2002)068[0038:OOTBOT]2.0.CO;2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041121\n10.2307/2442772\n10.1007/BF00984098\n10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01419.x\n10.1098/rstb.1996.0110\n10.2307/2411261\n10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01006.x\n10.2307/2405656\n10.1146/annurev.es.07.110176.002345\n10.1007/BF02859299\n10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01263.x\n10.1086/336946\n10.1016/j.tplants.2006.06.009\n10.4161/psb.6.12.18192\n10.4161/psb.1.1.2275\n10.1038/2151278a0\n10.1007/BF00385310"}
{"title": "The roles of knitted mesh-reinforced collagen-chitosan hybrid scaffold in the one-step repair of full-thickness skin defects in rats.", "abstract": "Full-thickness skin defects represent a significant and urgent clinical problem. Dermal substitutes serving as a regenerative template to induce dermal reconstruction provide a promising method to treat serious skin defects. Although collagen-chitosan dermal scaffolds display good biocompatibility and a suitable porous structure for angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, their poor mechanical properties compromise their application. To develop a well-supported dermal substitute, a poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) knitted mesh was fabricated and integrated with collagen-chitosan scaffold (CCS) to obtain a PLGA knitted mesh-reinforced CCS (PLGAm/CCS). The morphology of this PLGAm/CCS was investigated in vitro. To characterize the tissue response, specifically angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, the PLGAm/CCS was transplanted in combination with thin split-thickness autografts to repair full-thickness skin wounds using a one-step surgical procedure in Sprague-Dawley rats. These results were then compared with CCSs. At weeks 2, 4 and 8 after the operation, the healing wounds were imaged to analyse wound changes, and tissue specimens were harvested for histology, immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that collagen-chitosan sponge in the PLGAm/CCS remained porous, interconnected and occupied the openings of PLGA mesh, and the incorporation of the PLGA knitted mesh into CCS improved the mechanical strength with little influence on its mean pore size and porosity. Following transplantation, PLGAm/CCS inhibited wound contraction, and effectively promoted neotissue formation and blood vessel ingrowth. In conclusion, the mechanical strength of the scaffolds plays an important role in the process of tissue regeneration and vascularization. The ability of PLGAm/CCS to promote angiogenesis and induce in situ tissue regeneration demonstrates its potential in skin tissue engineering.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-04-23", "authors": ["XingangWang", "ChuangangYou", "XinleiHu", "YurongZheng", "QiyinLi", "ZhanzengFeng", "HuafengSun", "ChangyouGao", "ChunmaoHan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.04.017"}
{"title": "Neovascularization in diabetes and its complications. Unraveling the angiogenic paradox.", "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by the presence of hyperglycemia, which can lead to many complications over time. These complications, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, impaired wound healing and accelerated atherosclerosis, are implicated with a large number of cellular and subcellular changes on vessels. In agreement, evidence indicates that in retinopathy, nephropathy and atherosclerotic plaque, there is excessive angiogenesis, whereas in wound healing and myocardial perfusion, blood vessel growth is impaired. Despite the awareness of this angiogenic paradox, many questions remain unanswered. This review aims at highlighting the different microvascular and macrovascular complications that are often concurrent in diabetic patients. A revision of the recent findings published in the literature regarding the angiogenic paradox will be performed. Apparently, endothelial dysfunction, as well as molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) play a major role in diabetic vascular complications. Specific tissues with impaired angiogenesis exhibit microenvironment features, such as increased PAI-1/uPA ratio and decreased blood flow, whereas TGFbeta increases extracellular matrix deposition, preventing the vascularization process. In addition, the monocytes/macrophages are important in endothelium activation for arteriogenesis and its arteriogenic response is reduced, leading to impaired collateral artery growth. Moreover, molecular mechanisms involved will be addressed, including abnormalities in growth factor, cytokines and metabolic derangements.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2013-04-23", "authors": ["Paulo Zo\u00e9Costa", "RaquelSoares"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2013.04.001"}

Furthermore, symptoms in the tip of the tongue caused by stroke are typically characterized as gustatory sensory disturbances. A 62-year-old hypertensive man experienced an acute onset of severe numbness in the left tip of the tongue and ipsilateral lower lip. Neurological examination revealed no other abnormalities except for the aforementioned numbness. Head computed tomography showed a small hematoma in the medial part of the right thalamus, most likely within the VPM nucleus. The somatosensory impulse of the tongue is conveyed via the lingual nerve, and it reaches the contralateral medial VPM proper via the trigeminal spinal nucleus. Therefore, thalamic stroke mainly involving the medial VPM proper has the potential to elicit numbness in the tip of the tongue. A major portion of the VPM nucleus is vascularized by the inferolateral arteries. The inferolateral arteries vary greatly in the number and position of the arteries and their tributaries, and small-vessel disease in this territory can present with diverse symptoms because of this complexity.

Seven-day-old pups were subjected to OIR induction following the standard protocols of entering a hyperoxic chamber on day 7 (P7) and returning to a normoxic condition (relative hypoxia) on day 12 (P12). The retinal vasculatures in the OIR model 24 h (P8-O) or 5 days (P12-O) after switching to the hyperoxic environment and 24 h (P13-O) after returning to normoxic conditions were evaluated with retinal flat mounts and compared with those of age-matched controls (i.e., P8-N, P12-N, P13-N). Gene expression profiling was performed using Phalanx Mouse Whole Genome OneArray microarrays. Normal 9-day-old mice were considered representative of physiologic angiogenesis and compared with 30-day-old mice. A bioinformatics analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes using various comparisons, and real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used to confirm the changes in the genes of interest.\nThe sequential orders and patterns of vasculature development in normal mice and the OIR models were significantly different. In brief, in the early days (P1 to P7) for normal mice, retinal vessels grew from the optic disc into the non-vascularized retina in a radial fashion. In the hyperoxic stage of the OIR model, the main central retina became devoid of a vascular network, and when the mice returned to the normoxic room, the vessels grew from peripheral perfused areas toward the center of the retina, but the development of intermediate and deep layers of vasculature was significantly delayed. Gene profiling at three critical time points (P8, P12, and P13) showed that 162 probes were upregulated to \u22651.5-fold or downregulated to \u22640.67-fold at one or more time points in the OIR model compared to the controls. In the 45 upregulated genes for the P8-O/P8-N group, enriched genes were mainly related to cytoskeleton formation, whereas the 62 upregulated genes for P13-O/P13-N participated in various pathological processes. In the physiologic conditions on P9, however, 135 genes were upregulated compared with P30; the gap junction and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis were the two main enriched pathways for these genes. Fifty-three probes, including vascular endothelium growth factor A, annexin A2, and endothelin 2, changed at P13-O but not at P9-N, and these changed genes might reflect the modulation of pathological neovascularization.\nAngiogenesis in physiologic and pathological conditions is characterized by the differential presentation of vasculature and gene expression patterns.

We report the results in 16 patients treated for loss of the dominant half of a digital pulp from January 2000 to December 2008. On review after a minimum of 6 (range 6-18) months, the Weber's test demonstrated an average of 8 mm in static 2 point discrimination test for all digits, except the ring finger. In the monofilament Semmes-Weinstein test, we obtained a score of 3.61 for the thumb and little fingers, and 4.31 for the other fingers. We did not find partial or total necrosis of the flap.

{"title": "Exosomes reflect the hypoxic status of glioma cells and mediate hypoxia-dependent activation of vascular cells during tumor development.", "abstract": "Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is a major regulator of tumor development and aggressiveness. However, how cancer cells adapt to hypoxia and communicate with their surrounding microenvironment during tumor development remain important questions. Here, we show that secreted vesicles with exosome characteristics mediate hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling of the highly malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In vitro hypoxia experiments with glioma cells and studies with patient materials reveal the enrichment in exosomes of hypoxia-regulated mRNAs and proteins (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, IL-8, PDGFs, caveolin 1, and lysyl oxidase), several of which were associated with poor glioma patient prognosis. We show that exosomes derived from GBM cells grown at hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions are potent inducers of angiogenesis ex vivo and in vitro through phenotypic modulation of endothelial cells. Interestingly, endothelial cells were programmed by GBM cell-derived hypoxic exosomes to secrete several potent growth factors and cytokines and to stimulate pericyte PI3K/AKT signaling activation and migration. Moreover, exosomes derived from hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions showed increased autocrine, promigratory activation of GBM cells. These findings were correlated with significantly enhanced induction by hypoxic compared with normoxic exosomes of tumor vascularization, pericyte vessel coverage, GBM cell proliferation, as well as decreased tumor hypoxia in a mouse xenograft model. We conclude that the proteome and mRNA profiles of exosome vesicles closely reflect the oxygenation status of donor glioma cells and patient tumors, and that the exosomal pathway constitutes a potentially targetable driver of hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling during tumor development.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2013-04-17", "authors": ["PaulinaKucharzewska", "Helena CChristianson", "Johanna EWelch", "Katrin JSvensson", "ErikFredlund", "MarkusRingn\u00e9r", "MatthiasM\u00f6rgelin", "ErikaBourseau-Guilmain", "JohanBengzon", "MattiasBelting"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1220998110\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-421"}

In an effort to provide further insight into the neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by sex hormones we analyzed gene expression differences in the CP of female and male rats subjected to gonadectomy, using microarray technology. In gonadectomized female and male animals, 3045 genes were differentially expressed by 1.5-fold change, compared to sham controls. Analysis of the CP transcriptome showed that the top-five pathways significantly regulated by the sex hormone background are olfactory transduction, taste transduction, metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and circadian rhythm pathways.

Our findings support a beneficial role for HEXIM1 through increased vascularization, myocardial growth, and increased ejection fraction within the adult heart. HEXIM1 re-expression induces angiogenesis, that is, essential for physiological hypertrophy and maintenance of cardiac function. The ability of HEXIM1 to co-ordinate processes associated with physiological hypertrophy may be attributed to HEXIM1 regulation of other transcription factors (HIF-1-\u03b1, c-Myc, GATA4, and PPAR-\u03b1) that, in turn, control many genes involved in myocardial vascularization, growth, and metabolism.

Here we studied the potential contribution of human AFSCs to the modeling of an ectopic bone. We found that AFSCs are not osteogenic in vivo, and, compared to bone marrow-derived stromal cells, recruit more host CD31 and VEGF-R2 positive cells. Finally, when AFSCs were co-implanted with human-bone forming cells, a normo-osteosynthesis occurred, the engineered ossicle was hyper-vascularized, but AFSCs were not retrieved in the implant within 2weeks. We concluded that AFSCs do not contribute to the deposition of new bone, but act as a powerful proinflammatory/proangiogenic boost, driving a host response, ending in AFSC clearance and vascularization of the bone environment. In our model, a source of osteocommitted cells, capable to engraft and proliferate in vivo, is needed in order to engineer bone.

Native bone and vasculature develop through intimately coupled, tightly regulated spatiotemporal cell-cell signaling. The complexity of these developmental processes has been a challenge for tissue engineers to recapitulate, resulting in poor codevelopment of both bone and vasculature within a unified graft. To address this, we cultured adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs), a clinically relevant, single cell source that has been previously investigated for its ability to give rise to vascularized bone grafts, and studied the effects of initial spatial organization of cells, the temporal addition of growth factors, and the presence of exogenous platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) on the codevelopment of bone and vascular tissue structures. Human ASCs were aggregated into multicellular spheroids via the hanging drop method before encapsulation and subsequent outgrowth in fibrin gels. Cellular aggregation substantially increased vascular network density, interconnectivity, and pericyte coverage compared to monodispersed cultures. To form robust vessel networks, it was essential to culture ASCs in a purely vasculogenic medium for at least 8 days before the addition of osteogenic cues. Physiologically relevant concentrations of exogenous PDGF-BB (20 ng/mL) substantially enhanced both vascular network stability and osteogenic differentiation. Comparisons with the bone morphogenetic protein-2, another pro-osteogenic and proangiogenic growth factor, indicated that this potential to couple the formation of both lineages might be unique to PDGF-BB. Furthermore, the resulting tissue structure demonstrated the close association of mineral deposits with pre-existing vascular structures that have been described for developing tissues.

Acute rejections are common in the early post-operative period, and immunosuppression-related side effects have been manageable.

{"title": "Vascular collateralization along ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheters in moyamoya disease.", "abstract": "Surgically created openings such as bur holes can serve as avenues for the development of collateral blood supply to the brain in patients with moyamoya disease. When such collateralization occurs through preexisting shunt catheter sites, the potential exists for perioperative stroke if these vessels are damaged during revision of a ventricular catheter for shunt malfunction. In this paper the authors report on a series of patients with a history of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts who later developed moyamoya disease and were found to have spontaneous transdural collateral vessels at ventricular catheter sites readily visualized on diagnostic angiography. A consecutive surgical series of 412 patients with moyamoya disease treated at Boston Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2010 were reviewed to identify patients with concomitant moyamoya and a VP shunt. The clinical records and angiograms of these patients were reviewed to determine the extent of bur hole collaterals through the shunt site. Three patients were identified who had VP shunts placed for hydrocephalus and subsequently developed moyamoya disease. All 3 patients demonstrated spontaneous transdural collaterals at the ventricular catheter bur hole, as confirmed by angiography during the workup for moyamoya disease. No patients required subsequent revision of their ventricular catheters following the diagnosis of moyamoya. All patients have remained stroke free and clinically stable following pial synangiosis. Although the association of moyamoya and shunted hydrocephalus is rare, it may present a significant potential problem for the neurosurgeon treating a shunt malfunction in this patient population, because shunt bur holes may become entry sites for the ingrowth of significant cortical transdural collateral blood supply to the underlying brain. Shunt revision might therefore be associated with an increased risk of postoperative stroke or operative-site hemorrhage in this population if this vascularization is interrupted when shunt catheters are removed and replaced. A knowledge of the existence of shunt-related collaterals in patients with moyamoya may aid the surgeon in planning shunt revisions and considering, for example, a new entry point for a ventricular catheter, rather than replacing an existing one, to minimize the risk of jeopardizing existing collaterals.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

While these haemodynamic forces are crucial determinants of the appearance and the structure of the vasculature, they are in turn subjected to structural changes in the blood vessels, such as an increased arterial stiffness in chronic arterial hypertension and ageing. This results in an interplay between the various forces (biomechanical forces) and the involved vascular elements. Although many molecular mediators of biomechanical forces still need to be identified, there is plenty of evidence for the causal role of these forces in vascular growth processes, which will be summarized in this review. In addition, we will discuss the effects of concomitant diseases and disorders on these processes by altering either the biomechanics or their transduction into biological signals. Particularly endothelial dysfunction, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and age affect mechanosensing and -transduction of flow signals, thereby underpinning their influence on cardiovascular health. Finally, current approaches to modify biomechanical forces to therapeutically modulate vascular growth in humans will be described.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2013-04-13", "authors": ["Imo EHoefer", "Brigitden Adel", "Mat J A PDaemen"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvt089"}
{"title": "The promotion of bone regeneration through positive regulation of angiogenic-osteogenic coupling using microRNA-26a.", "abstract": "Bone is highly vascularized tissue reliant on coordinated coupling between angiogenesis and osteogenesis to regenerate. Delivery of a combination of growth factors involved in the coupling has to some extent enhanced bone regeneration. However, the stimulation may interrupt the balance of bone and vessel remodeling leading to the excessive bone formation or vascular leakage. MicroRNAs function as potent molecular managers that may simultaneously regulate multiple endogenous signaling pathways. Delivery of microRNA may provide a way to maximally mimic the native bone development environment. In this work, we identified an miRNA, miR-26a in vitro assays that positively regulates angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling. This resulted in enhanced bone formation coordinated with vascularization in mouse subcutaneous assay. Furthermore, we constructed an miRNA enhancer delivery system to enhance miR-26a expression in a localized and sustained manner in vivo. We found that the system led to complete repair of the critical-size calvarial bone defect and increased vascularization accordingly. Host specific real-time PCR test of the neo-formed bone demonstrated that miR-26a optimized bone regeneration mainly due to simultaneously regulating endogenous angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling. We anticipated our assay providing evidence that miRNA-based therapy can be a valuable tool to promote bone regeneration.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2013-04-13", "authors": ["YanLi", "LongkunFan", "ShiyuLiu", "WenjiaLiu", "HaoZhang", "TaoZhou", "DanWu", "PingYang", "LijuanShen", "JihuaChen", "YanJin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.052"}

The proposed methodology creates a partition of the territory to be vascularized into nonoverlapping subdomains that are independently supplied by the so-called perforator arteries (inflow sites).

The identification of subdomains in a certain vascular territory perfused by many perforator arteries turns out to be a fundamental problem towards understanding the morphological conformation of peripheral beds in the cardiovascular system.

Recently, researchers have focused on immunomodulatory protocols which overcome the immunologic barrier between the allogeneic donor and recipient and may lead to tolerance induction. In order to test the feasibility of chimerism induction, experimental VCAs have been performed in different models including rodents, large animals, and nonhuman primates. These models differ in the complexity of transplanted tissue and in their responses to immunomodulatory protocols. In most applications, VCA contains multiple-tissue components; however, each individual component of CTA possesses unique immunologic characteristics that ultimately contribute to the chimerism induction and successful outcome of the VCA. Heterogenic character and complexity of tissue components in different VCA models determine the quality and robustness of donor-specific chimerism. As introduced in experimental studies, variable immunomodulatory options have been studied to achieve tolerance to VCA in rodents and large animal models allowing for widespread application in clinic. In this paper, based on our own experience, we have analyzed the current knowledge of tolerance-inducing strategies via chimerism induction in VCA experimental models in the context of immunomodulatory protocols and VCA complexity and their relevance and applicability to clinical practice.", "journal": "Clinical & developmental immunology", "date": "2013-04-11", "authors": ["MariaSiemionow", "AleksandraKlimczak"], "doi": "10.1155/2013/831410"}

{"title": "Validated Laser Doppler protocol for measurement of mouse bone blood perfusion - response to age or ovariectomy differs with genetic background.", "abstract": "The physiological role of bone vascularization in bone metabolism begins to be understood; however, its involvement in pathological situations remains poorly explored. Bone blood supply depends on both vascular density and blood flow. However, in mice, the specific evaluation of perfusion in bone suffers from a lack of easy-handling measurement tools. In the present study, we first developed a Laser Doppler Perfusion Measurement (LDPM) protocol in mouse tibia, which we validated with ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Then we carried out a study associating both structural (vascular quantitative histomorphometry) and functional (LDPM) approaches. We studied the effects of aging in 4, 7 and 17 month-old male mice and the early effects of ovariectomy in 4 month-old females. Both studies were carried out in inbred mice (C57BL/6) and in mice of mixed background (129sv/CD1). The significant differences we observed between strains in unchallenged 4 month-old animals concerned both perfusion and vascular density and depended on gender. Additionally, the age-related bone loss observed in male mice was not temporally associated with vascular changes in either strain. Between 7 and 17 months, we did not find any decrease in bone vascular density or perfusion. In contrast, ovariectomy triggered early vascular structural and functional adaptations which differed between genetic backgrounds. We observed that bone vessel density did not generally account for bone perfusion levels. In conclusion, we describe here a LDPM-based experimental protocol which provides a reproducible quantitative evaluation of bone perfusion in mouse tibia, hence allowing intergroup comparisons. This integrative structural and functional approach of bone vascularization showed that bone vascular adaptation occurs during aging or after ovariectomy and is affected by the genetic background.", "journal": "Bone", "date": "2013-04-11", "authors": ["BernardRoche", "ArnaudVanden-Bossche", "MyriamNormand", "LucMalaval", "LaurenceVico", "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8neLafage-Proust"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bone.2013.03.022"}
{"title": "Angiogenic responses are enhanced in mechanically and microscopically characterized, microbial transglutaminase crosslinked collagen matrices with increased stiffness.", "abstract": "During angiogenesis, endothelial cells (ECs) use both soluble and insoluble cues to expand the existing vascular network to meet the changing trophic needs of the tissue. Fundamental to this expansion are physical interactions between ECs and extracellular matrix (ECM) that influence sprout migration, lumen formation and stabilization. These physical interactions suggest that ECM mechanical properties may influence sprouting ECs and, therefore, angiogenic responses. In a three-dimensional angiogenic model in which a monolayer of ECs is induced to invade an underlying collagen matrix, angiogenic responses were measured as a function of collagen matrix stiffness by inducing collagen crosslinking with microbial transglutaminase (mTG). By biaxial mechanical testing, stiffer collagen matrices were measured with both mTG treatment and incubation time. Using two-photon excited fluorescence (TPF) and second harmonic generation (SHG), it was shown that collagen TPF intensity increased with mTG treatment, and the TPF/SHG ratio correlated with biaxially tested mechanical stiffness. SHG and OCM were further used to show that other ECM physical properties such as porosity and pore size did not change with mTG treatment, thus verifying that matrix stiffness was tuned independently of matrix density. The results showed that stiffer matrices promote more angiogenic sprouts that invade deeper. No differences in lumen size were observed between control and mTG stiffened matrices, but greater remodeling was revealed in stiffer gels using SHG and OCM. The results of this study show that angiogenic responses are influenced by stiffness and suggest that ECM properties may be useful in regenerative medicine applications to engineer angiogenesis.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-04-11", "authors": ["P-FLee", "YBai", "R LSmith", "K JBayless", "A TYeh"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.04.001"}

Current absorption-based computed tomography (CT) without the application of contrast material is limited in the detection of minor density differences in soft-tissue. The purpose of this study is to test whether PCCT can improve soft tissue contrast in healthy and tumorous human liver specimens.\nTwo specimens of human liver (one healthy and one metastasized liver sample) were imaged with brilliant X-ray beam at the synchrotron radiation source ESRF in Grenoble, France. For correlation the same specimens were imaged with a magnetic resonance imaging system at 1.5 T. The histopathology confirmed our findings in the corresponding sections of the specimens.\nIn the phase-contrast CT images we observed a significantly enhanced soft-tissue contrast when compared to simultaneously recorded standard absorption CT measurements. Further, we found that the pathological and morphological information in the PCCT reconstructions show significant improvement when compared to those performed on MRI. Based on matching of prominent features, a good correlation between PCCT and the histological section is demonstrated; especially the tumor capsule and the surrounding vascular structures are visible in PCCT. In addition, our study revealed the ability of PCCT to visualize the blood vessels structure in the tumorous liver without the need of any contrast agents.\nGrating-based PCCT significantly improves the soft-tissue contrast in ex-vivo liver specimens and holds the potential to overcome the need of contrast materials for visualization of the tumor vascularization.", "journal": "Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik", "date": "2013-04-11", "authors": ["Peter BNo\u00ebl", "JuliaHerzen", "Alexander AFingerle", "MarianWillner", "Marco KStockmar", "DieterHahn", "MarcusSettles", "EnkenDrecoll", "IreneZanette", "TimmWeitkamp", "Ernst JRummeny", "FranzPfeiffer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.zemedi.2013.02.006"}

Our model reconstructed the 3D bone regeneration system and examined the effects of pore size and porosity on bone formation and angiogenesis. The results suggested that scaffold porosity played a more dominant role in affecting bone formation and angiogenesis compared with pore size, while the pore size could be controlled to tailor the growth factor release rate and release fraction.

Previous studies have demonstrated that engineering bone tissue using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is feasible. However, this approach is not effective for CSBDs due to inadequate vascularization. In our previous study, we have developed an injectable and porous nano calcium sulfate/alginate (nCS/A) scaffold and demonstrated that nCS/A composition is biocompatible and has proper biodegradability for bone regeneration. Here, we hypothesized that the combination of an injectable and porous nCS/A with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene-modified MSCs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) could significantly enhance vascularized bone regeneration. Our results demonstrated that delivery of MSCs and EPCs with the injectable nCS/A scaffold did not affect cell viability. Moreover, co-culture of BMP2 gene-modified MSCs and EPCs dramatically increased osteoblast differentiation of MSCs and endothelial differentiation of EPCs in vitro. We further tested the multifunctional bone reconstruction system consisting of an injectable and porous nCS/A scaffold (mimicking the nano-calcium matrix of bone) and BMP2 genetically-engineered MSCs and EPCs in a rat critical-sized (8 mm) caviarial bone defect model. Our in vivo results showed that, compared to the groups of nCS/A, nCS/A+MSCs, nCS/A+MSCs+EPCs and nCS/A+BMP2 gene-modified MSCs, the combination of BMP2 gene -modified MSCs and EPCs in nCS/A dramatically increased the new bone and vascular formation.

{"title": "Effects of VEGF-loaded chitosan coatings.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a powerful growth factor that promotes vascularization as well as osteoblastic differentiation and bone regeneration, all of which are key processes in the osseointegration of dental implants. Strategies to increase vascularization through delivery of VEGF may improve osseointegration, especially in patients with reduced bone healing potential. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of chitosan coatings on titanium to deliver VEGF and to support growth and matrix production of osteoblastic cells in vitro. Chitosan was chemically bonded to titanium coupons via silane-glutaraldehyde linker molecules and loaded with 0, 20, 50, or 100 ng of VEGF. Protein was released during a three day period with around 75% of VEGF (4.44, 11.37, and 22.10 ng/mL/cm(2) from the 20, 50, and 100 ng loaded levels, respectively) released during the first 12 h, and 90-95% of the VEGF released from the coatings by day 3. Saos-2 bone cells continued to proliferate over the 28-day period on the VEGF-loaded chitosan coatings in contrast to cells seeded on uncoated titanium, which plateaued after 14 days. Cells on uncoated titanium exhibited a peak in alkaline phosphatase expression at approximately 14 days, concomitant with the plateau in growth. While osteoblast-like cells on all chitosan coatings exhibited up to a 2-fold enhancement of the alkaline phosphatase activity and 10-fold increase in calcium deposition compared to uncoated controls, the incorporation of VEGF into the coatings did not enhance osteoblast matrix production over plain chitosan coatings throughout this study.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The splenium is unique in that it is part of the largest commissural tract in the brain and a region in which pathologies are seen frequently. An exact description of the arterial vascularization of this part of the CC remains under debate. Thirty adult human brains (60 hemispheres) were obtained from routine autopsies. Cerebral arteries were separately cannulated and injected with colored latex. Then, the brains were fixed in formaldehyde, and dissections were performed using a surgical microscope. The diameter of the arterial branches supplying the splenium of the CC at their origin was investigated, and the vascularization patterns of these branches were observed. Vascular supply to the splenium was provided by the anterior pericallosal artery (40%) from the anterior circulation and by the posterior pericallosal artery (88%) and posterior accessory pericallosal artery (50%) from the posterior circulation. The vascularization pattern of the splenium differs in each hemisphere and is usually supplied by multiple branches. The arterial vascularization of the splenium of the CC was studied comprehensively considering the ongoing debate and the inadequacy of the studies on this issue currently available in the literature.

{"title": "Bone tissue engineering in osteoporosis.", "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a polygenetic, environmentally modifiable disease, which precipitates into fragility fractures of vertebrae, hip and radius and also confers a high risk of fractures in accidents and trauma. Aging and the genetic molecular background of osteoporosis cause delayed healing and impair regeneration. The worldwide burden of disease is huge and steadily increasing while the average life expectancy is also on the rise. The clinical need for bone regeneration applications, systemic or in situ guided bone regeneration and bone tissue engineering, will increase and become a challenge for health care systems. Apart from in situ guided tissue regeneration classical ex vivo tissue engineering of bone has not yet reached the level of routine clinical application although a wealth of scaffolds and growth factors has been developed. Engineering of complex bone constructs in vitro requires scaffolds, growth and differentiation factors, precursor cells for angiogenesis and osteogenesis and suitable bioreactors in various combinations. The development of applications for ex vivo tissue engineering of bone faces technical challenges concerning rapid vascularization for the survival of constructs in vivo. Recent new ideas and developments in the fields of bone biology, materials science and bioreactor technology will enable us to develop standard operating procedures for ex vivo tissue engineering of bone in the near future.

All mice were sacrificed at 6 months. Both treatments were equally effective in normalizing GAG levels in the viscera but had no detectable effect on the joint. Heart function was also improved with both treatments. On the other hand, mice treated from birth presented better outcomes in the difficult-to-treat aortas and heart valves. Surprisingly, both groups had improvements in behavior tests, and normalization of GAG levels in the brain and IDUA injection resulted in detectable levels of enzyme in the brain tissue 1h after administration. ERT-ad mice developed significantly more anti-IDUA-IgG antibodies, and mice that didn't develop antibodies had better performances in behavior tests, indicating that development of antibodies may reduce enzyme bioavailability. Our results suggest that ERT started from birth leads to better outcomes in the aorta and heart valves, as well as a reduction in antibody levels. Some poor vascularized organs, such as the joints, had partial or no benefit and ancillary therapies might be needed for patients. The results presented here support the idea that ERT started from birth leads to better treatment outcomes and should be considered whenever possible, a observation that gains relevance as newborn screening programs are being considered for MPS and other treatable lysosomal storage disorders.", "journal": "Molecular genetics and metabolism", "date": "2013-04-09", "authors": ["GuilhermeBaldo", "Fabiana QMayer", "B\u00e1rbara ZMartinelli", "Talita Gde Carvalho", "Fabiola SMeyer", "Patr\u00edcia Gde Oliveira", "LuiseMeurer", "AngelaTavares", "UrsulaMatte", "RobertoGiugliani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ymgme.2013.03.005"}

{"title": "Enhancing osteoconductivity of fibrin gels with apatite-coated polymer microspheres.", "abstract": "Fibrin gels are a promising material for use in promoting bone repair and regeneration due to their ease of implant formation, tailorability, biocompatibility, and degradation by natural processes. However, these materials lack necessary osteoconductivity to nucleate calcium, integrate with surrounding bone, and promote bone formation. Polymeric substrata formed from poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) are widely used in bone tissue engineering. A carbonated apatite layer of bone-like mineral can be successfully grown on the surface of PLG microspheres after a multiday incubation process in modified simulated body fluid. Such coatings improve the osteoconductivity of the polymer, provide nucleation sites for cell-secreted calcium, and enhance the potential osseointegration with host tissue. We examined the capacity of mineralized polymeric microspheres suspended within fibrin hydrogels to enhance the osteoconductivity of fibrin gels and increase the osteogenic potential of these materials. The inclusion of microparticles, both nonmineralized and mineralized, reduced the capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to contract the gel. When cultured in osteogenic media, we detected a near linear increase in both calcium and phosphate incorporation in gels containing mineralized microspheres and entrapped MSCs. The osteoconductivity of acellular fibrin gels with mineralized and nonmineralized microspheres was assessed in a rodent calvarial bone defect over 12 weeks. Compared to untreated rodent calvarial bone defects, we detected significant increases in early vascularization when treated with fibrin gels, with greater vascularization, on average, occurring with gels containing microspheres. We detected a trend for increased bone mineral density in gels containing mineralized microspheres after 12 weeks. These findings demonstrate that the osteoconductivity of fibrin gels can be increased by inclusion of mineralized microspheres, but additional signals may be required to rapidly accelerate bone repair.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Are concerns about EVAR durability relevant with modern devices?", "abstract": "Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is now universally adopted as first-line therapy for the management of large abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The applicability has broadened such that up to 80% of patients are morphologically suitable for EVAR. In-spite of the evidence base demonstrating improved early outcomes following EVAR compared to open surgery, and informed patients' preference, EVAR-sceptics remain. The doubters voice anxieties regarding the durability of an endovascular repair and cite evidence of graft failures from the EVAR-1 trial results. Historically, graft migration and endoleak development have been the Achilles heel of EVAR. However, EVAR is an evolving technology that over the last 10 years has seen significant development from industry, and greater experience among clinicians. This has combined with centralisation of expertise in larger vascular units, with increased case-volume, leading to more appropriate periprocedural and long-term care. Current devices offer a durable repair for patients with infra-renal aortic aneurysms. The risk of graft migration is minimised by devices with secure fixation systems, potentially limiting de-novo type 1 and 3 endoleaks. Appropriate surveillance and timely endovascular re-interventions are perhaps the most important factors to ensure robust long-term outcomes from endovascular repair, even when native vessel morphology changes. Industry registry evidence and large single unit case series are now generating a healthy evidence base of EVAR durability in contemporary endovascular practice, that affirms its role as first-line therapy in the majority of morphologically suitable patients.", "journal": "The Journal of cardiovascular surgery", "date": "2013-04-06", "authors": ["I MNordon", "M MThompson", "I MLoftus"], "doi": null}

In this study, we extended the quantification of planar vessel distribution to the analysis of vascular volumes by studying the effects of antiangiogenic (sorafenib and sunitinib) or antivascular (combretastatin A4 phosphate) treatments on the quantity and spatial distributions of thin microvessels. These observations were restricted to perinecrotic areas of treated human multiple myeloma tumors xenografted in immunodeficient mice and to microvessels with an approximate cross-sectional area lower than 75 \u00b5m(2). Finally, vessel skeletonization minimized artifacts due to possible differential wall staining and allowed a comparison of the various treatment effects. Antiangiogenic drug treatment reduced the number of vessels of every caliber (at least 2-fold fewer vessels vs. controls; p<0.001, n\u200a=\u200a8) and caused a heterogeneous distribution of the remaining vessels. In contrast, the effects of combretastatin A4 phosphate mainly appeared to be restricted to a homogeneous reduction in the number of thin microvessels (not more than 2-fold less vs. controls; p<0.001, n\u200a=\u200a8) with marginal effects on spatial distribution. Unexpectedly, these results also highlighted a strict relationship between microvessel quantity, distribution and cross-sectional area. Treatment-specific changes in the curves describing this relationship were consistent with the effects ascribed to the different drugs.

{"title": "Temporal and pharmacological characterization of angiostatin release and generation by human platelets: implications for endothelial cell migration.", "abstract": "Platelets play an important role in thrombosis and in neo-vascularisation as they release and produce factors that both promote and suppress angiogenesis. Amongst these factors is the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin, which is released during thrombus formation. The impact of anti-thrombotic agents and the kinetics of platelet angiostatin release are unknown. Hence, our objectives were to characterize platelet angiostatin release temporally and pharmacologically and to determine how angiostatin release influences endothelial cell migration, an early stage of angiogenesis. We hypothesized anti-platelet agents would suppress angiostatin release but not generation by platelets. Human platelets were aggregated and temporal angiostatin release was compared to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immuno-gold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy identified \u03b1-granules as storage organelles of platelet angiostatin. Acetylsalicylic acid, MRS2395, GPIIb/IIIa blocking peptide, and aprotinin were used to characterize platelet angiostatin release and generation. An endothelial cell migration assay was performed under hypoxic conditions to determine the effects of pharmacological platelet and angiostatin inhibition. Compared to VEGF, angiostatin generation and release from \u03b1-granules occurred later temporally during platelet aggregation. Consequently, collagen-activated platelet releasates stimulated endothelial cell migration more potently than maximally-aggregated platelets. Platelet inhibitors prostacyclin, S-nitroso-glutathione, acetylsalicylic acid, and GPIIb/IIIa blocking peptide, but not a P2Y12 inhibitor, suppressed angiostatin release but not generation. Suppression of angiostatin generation in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid enhanced platelet-stimulated endothelial migration.

To evaluate the delivery efficiency, it is important to predict the distribution of NPs within blood vessels. NP size, shape and vessel geometry are believed to influence its biodistribution in circulation. Whereas, the effect of size on nanoparticle distribution has been extensively studied, little is known about the shape and vessel geometry effect. This paper describes a computational model for NP transport and distribution in a mimetic branched blood vessel using combined NP Brownian dynamics and continuum fluid mechanics approaches. The simulation results indicate that NPs with smaller size and rod shape have higher binding capabilities as a result of smaller drag force and larger contact area. The binding dynamics of rod-shaped NPs is found to be dependent on their initial contact points and orientations to the wall. Higher concentration of NPs is observed in the bifurcation area compared to the straight section of the branched vessel. Moreover, it is found that P\u00e9clet number plays an important role in determining the fraction of NPs deposited in the branched region and the straight section. Simulation results also indicate that NP binding decreases with increased shear rate. Dynamic NP re-distribution from low to high shear rates is observed due to the non-uniform shear stress distribution over the branched channel.

In this paper, we present novel algorithms for unsupervised identification of cerebral vascularization, allowing blind separation of stimulus representations from noise. These algorithms commonly take advantage of the temporal fluctuations in global reflectance to extract anatomic information. More specifically, the phase of low-frequency oscillations relative to global fluctuations reveals local vascular identity. Arterioles can be reconstructed using their characteristically high power in those frequencies corresponding to respiration, heartbeat, and vasomotion signals. By treating the vasculature as a dynamic flow network, we finally demonstrate that direction of blood perfusion can be quantitatively visualized. Application of these methods for removal of stimulus-independent changes in reflectance permits isolation of stimulus-evoked representations even if the representation spatially overlaps with blood vessels. The algorithms can be expanded further to extract temporal information on blood flow, monitor revascularization following a focal stroke, and distinguish arterioles from venules and parenchyma.", "journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "date": "2013-04-05", "authors": ["Russell SStewart", "ChaoHuang", "Megan TArnett", "TansuCelikel"], "doi": "10.1152/jn.01200.2011"}

A continuing hurdle is the need for a functional blood supply to and from the implanted scaffold. We have addressed this problem by constructing an acellular ileal scaffold with an attached vascular network suitable for implantation and immediate reperfusion with the host's blood. Using a vascular perfusion approach, a segment of porcine ileum up to 30\u2009cm long, together with its attached vasculature, was decellularized as a single entity. The quality of the decellularized scaffold was assessed histologically and using molecular tools. To establish vascular perfusion potentials of the scaffold, a right-sided nephrectomy and end-to-end anastomosis of the decellularized scaffold's vasculature to a renal artery and vein were performed in a pig of similar size to the donor animal. Lengths of ileal scaffold, together with its attached vasculature, were successfully decellularized, with no evidence of intact cells/nuclear material or collagen degradation. The scaffold's decellularized vascular network demonstrated optimum perfusion at 1, 2 and 24\u2009h post-implantation and the mesenteric arcade remained patent throughout the assessment. The 1, 2 and 24\u2009h explanted scaffolds demonstrated signs of cellular attachment, with cells positive for CD68 and CD133 on the vascular luminal aspect.

{"title": "Evaluation of magnesium-yttrium alloy as an extraluminal tracheal stent.", "abstract": "Tracheomalacia is a relatively rare problem, but can be challenging to treat, particularly in pediatric patients. Due to the presence of mechanically deficient cartilage, the trachea is unable to resist collapse under physiologic pressures of respiration, which can lead to acute death if left untreated. However, if treated, the outcome for patients with congenital tracheomalacia is quite good because the cartilage tends to spontaneously mature over a period of 12 to 18 months. The present study investigated the potential for the use of degradable magnesium-3% yttrium alloy (W3) to serve as an extraluminal tracheal stent in a canine model. The host response to the scaffold included the formation of a thin, vascularized capsule consisting of collagenous tissue and primarily mononuclear cells. The adjacent cartilage structure was not adversely affected as observed by bronchoscopic, gross, histologic, and mechanical analysis. The W3 stents showed reproducible spatial and temporal fracture patterns, but otherwise tended to corrode quite slowly, with a mix of Ca and P rich corrosion product formed on the surface and observed focal regions of pitting.

In light of their already well-characterized osteogenesis-improving capabilities in animals, we performed this translational study to investigate these membranes in patients.\nFourteen patients with complicated fractures and bone defects were randomly selected for this study. Biopsy samples of foreign-body-induced membranes were collected at different time points during scheduled surgical procedures. The membranes were co-cultured with mesenchymal stromal cells, and differentiation into the osteoblastic lineage was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, aminoterminal propeptide of type-I procollagen (PINP) production, and Ca2+ concentration. Histological characteristics were evaluated with image analysis. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to measure vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and type-I collagen (Col-1) expression.\nThe induced membranes were characterized histologically by maturating vascularized fibrous tissue. The vascularization was greatest in one-month-old samples and decreased to <60% in three-month-old samples. One-month-old membrane samples had the highest expression of VEGF, IL-6, and Col-1, whereas two-month-old membranes expressed <40% of the levels of the one-month-old membranes. Specific alkaline phosphatase activity, PINP production, and Ca2+ concentration were increased in co-cultures when a membrane sample was present. In cultures of one-month-old membranes, PINP production was more than two times and Ca2+ deposition was four times higher than that in cultures of two-month-old membranes.\nThe induced membranes have osteogenesis-improving capabilities.

Hematoxylin and Eosin stained sections of the cornea revealed epithelial ulceration, Bowman's membrane destruction, stromal vascularization, infiltration with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells (MNGC). The areas of scleritis showed complete disruption of sclera collagen, necrosis and infiltration with neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and granulomatous inflammation with MNGC. No cyst or trophozoites of Acanthamoeba were seen in the cornea or sclera. Immunophenotyping revealed that the population of lymphocytes was predominantly of T cells. Granulomatous inflammation in ASK is probably responsible for the continuance and progression of the scleritis and management protocols should include immunosuppressive agents alongside amoebicidal drugs.", "journal": "Indian journal of ophthalmology", "date": "2013-04-05", "authors": ["SamratChatterjee", "DeepshikhaAgrawal", "Geeta KVemuganti"], "doi": "10.4103/0301-4738.99844"}

Although current antiangiogenic strategies have shown promising results in several cancer types, identification of additional antiangiogenic targets is required to improve the therapeutic response. Herein, we show that the microtubule-binding protein CLIP-170 (cytoplasmic linker protein of 170 kDa) is highly expressed in breast tumor samples and correlates positively with blood vessel density. Depletion of CLIP-170 significantly impaired vascular endothelial tube formation and sprouting in vitro and inhibited breast tumor growth in mice by decreasing tumor vascularization. Our data further show that CLIP-170 is important for the migration but not the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. In addition, CLIP-170 promotes the polarization of endothelial cells in response to the angiogenic stimulus. These findings thus demonstrate a critical role for CLIP-170 in tumor angiogenesis and suggest its potential as a novel antiangiogenic target.", "journal": "Protein & cell", "date": "2013-04-04", "authors": ["XiaodongSun", "FangLi", "BinDong", "ShaojunSuo", "MinLiu", "DengwenLi", "JunZhou"], "doi": "10.1007/s13238-013-3007-z\n10.1038/nrm2369\n10.1038/nrm2524\n10.1097/GCO.0b013e328334e462\n10.1038/nature10144\n10.1172/JCI200422716\n10.1038/nrd2115\n10.1182/blood-2009-10-248526\n10.1016/B978-0-12-381047-2.00001-3\n10.1161/01.RES.0000259593.07661.1e\n10.1007/s13238-011-1015-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036389\n10.1038/nrm2522\n10.1002/path.2706\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2011.12.002\n10.1016/j.bcp.2012.02.008\n10.1038/ncb0703-599\n10.4161/cc.19954\n10.1073/pnas.0710018105\n10.1002/path.3026\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.069\n10.1007/978-1-61779-207-6_1\n10.1002/path.2512\n10.1016/j.tcb.2004.12.006\n10.1038/nm.2537"}

The aim of the present work is to evaluate the possibility of obtaining homologous acellular scaffolds from decellularization of the omentum, which is known to have a complex vascular network. Adult rat and human omenta were treated with an adapted decellularization protocol involving mechanical rupture (freeze-thaw cycles), enzymatic digestion (trypsin, lipase, deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease) and lipid extraction (2-propanol). Histological staining confirmed the effectiveness of decellularization, resulting in cell-free scaffolds with no residual cells in the matrix. The complex 3D networks of collagen (azan-Mallory), elastic fibers (Van Gieson), reticular fibers and glycosaminoglycans (PAS) were maintained, whereas Oil Red and Sudan stains showed the loss of lipids in the decellularized tissue. The vascular structures in the tissue were still visible, with preservation of collagen and elastic wall components and loss of endothelial (anti-CD31 and -CD34 immunohistochemistry) and smooth muscle (anti-alpha smooth muscle actin) cells. Fat-rich and well vascularized omental tissue may be decellularized to obtain complex 3D scaffolds preserving tissue architecture potentially suitable for recellularization.

Patients needing pre-prosthetic rehabilitation of the posterior maxilla were treated using an equine-derived biomaterial (Group 1) or calvaria autologous bone (Group 2), according to the morphology of the bone defect. Bone graft integration was evaluated on bone samples obtained from the treated areas at the moment of dental implant insertion, by morphological and immunohistochemical analyses for TGF\u03b21, OPG, RANKL, VEGF, BSP, and SPARC expression. Morphological analysis shows the presence of biomaterial residual granules in Group 1, in parallel to a good integration between graft and host tissue. Moderate TGF\u03b21 expression is seen in both Group 1 and Group 2. OPG/RANKL ratio appear higher in Group 1; VEGF expression appears very strong in Group 1 and strong in Group 2, while BSP and SPARC expression results weak in Group 1 and moderate in Group 2.

Various grafting methods have been used for smaller skull base defects with great success. The indications for endoscopic reconstruction have recently evolved to encompass much larger breeches in the skull base following tumor removal, thus emphasizing the need for vascularized tissue flaps for reconstruction.\nSome authors proposed a pedicled flap of the nasal septum mucoperiosteum and mucoperichondrium, which is very vascularized and has quite a large surface. It is also long enough to easily cover even larger defects of the skull base. The elevation of a nasoseptal flap is based on a particularly advanced surgical technique and thus requires proper training before being performed in a real patient.\nAnatomical differences between human and lamb heads were observed and explained although they do not affect the procedure of the elevation of the nasoseptal flap.\nThe lamb's head has been shown to be an ideal model for the adequate training of the surgical skills required for this demanding procedure.", "journal": "ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties", "date": "2013-04-04", "authors": ["RankoMladina", "PaoloCastelnuovo", "DavideLocatelli", "Katarina\u0110uri\u0107 Vukovi\u0107", "NevenSkitareli\u0107"], "doi": "10.1159/000347080"}

For the development of better treatments a better understanding of biochemical changes in the resistant tumors is needed. In this study, we focus on the characterization of in vivo chemoresistant human hepatocellular carcinoma HUH-REISO established from a metronomically cyclophosphamide (CPA) treated HUH7 xenograft model.\nSCID mice bearing subcutaneous HUH7 tumors were treated i.p. with 75 mg/kg CPA every six days. Tumors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, a functional blood-flow Hoechst dye assay, and qRT-PCR for ALDH-1, Notch-1, Notch-3, HES-1, Thy-1, Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog mRNA levels. Cell lines of these tumors were analyzed by qRT-PCR and in endothelial transdifferentiation studies on matrigel.\nHUH-REISO cells, although slightly more sensitive against activated CPA in vitro than parental HUH-7 cells, fully retained their in vivo CPA chemoresistance upon xenografting into SCID mice. Histochemical analysis of HUH-REISO tumors in comparison to parental HUH-7 cells and passaged HUH-PAS cells (in vivo passaged without chemotherapeutic pressure) revealed significant changes in host vascularization of tumors and especially in expression of the tumor-derived human endothelial marker gene PECAM-1/CD31 in HUH-REISO. In transdifferentiation studies with limited oxygen and metabolite diffusion, followed by a matrigel assay, only the chemoresistant HUH-REISO cells exhibited tube formation potential and expression of human endothelial markers ICAM-2 and PECAM-1/CD31. A comparative study on stemness and plasticity markers revealed upregulation of Thy-1, Oct-4, Sox-2 and Nanog in resistant xenografts. Under therapeutic pressure by CPA, tumors of HUH-PAS and HUH-REISO displayed regulations in Notch-1 and Notch-3 expression.\nChemoresistance of HUH-REISO was not manifested under standard in vitro but under in vivo conditions. HUH-REISO cells showed increased pluripotent capacities and the ability of transdifferentiation to endothelial like cells in vitro and in vivo. These cells expressed typical endothelial surface marker and functionality.

Three distinct groups of 3-D matrices were fabricated from aqueous solutions of Bombyx mori silk fibroin either by a gel spinning technique (GS1 and GS2 groups) or a solvent-casting/salt-leaching method in combination with silk film casting (FF group). SEM analyses revealed that GS1 matrices consisted of smooth, compact multi-laminates of parallel-oriented silk fibers while GS2 scaffolds were composed of porous (pore size range, 5-50 \u03bcm) lamellar-like sheets buttressed by a dense outer layer. Bi-layer FF scaffolds were comprised of porous foams (pore size, ~400 \u03bcm) fused on their external face with a homogenous, nonporous silk film. Silk groups and small intestinal submucosa (SIS) matrices were evaluated in a rat model of augmentation cystoplasty for 10 weeks of implantation and compared to cystotomy controls. Gross tissue evaluations revealed the presence of intra-luminal stones in all experimental groups. The incidence and size of urinary calculi was the highest in animals implanted with gel spun silk matrices and SIS with frequencies \u226557% and stone diameters of 3-4 mm. In contrast, rats augmented with FF scaffolds displayed substantially lower rates (20%) and stone size (2 mm), similar to the levels observed in controls (13%, 2 mm).

Parallel evaluations demonstrated the formation of a transitional, multi-layered urothelium with prominent uroplakin and p63 protein expression in all experimental groups. De novo innervation and vascularization processes were evident in all regenerated tissues indicated by Fox3-positive neuronal cells and vessels lined with CD31 expressing endothelial cells.

EMERGING CONCEPTS: A recent approach in tissue/organ engineering, particularly to build bioartificial airways, is the procedure of decellularizing a whole donor organ to obtain a complex 3D-biomatrix-scaffold maintaining the intrinsic vascular network, that is subsequently recellularized with recipient's autologous organ-specific differentiated cells or/and stem cells, to build a potentially functional biological substitute. Such strategy has been clinically used to replace organ in trachea/broncus tumor patients. In another approach, mainly used to construct a bioartificial urinary bladder tissue, different types of either biodegradable synthetic polymers or naturally-derived matrices or even polymer/biomatrix-composite materials are used as scaffold for either cell-free or autologous cell-seeded tissue engineering procedures. So far, such technique has been mainly used to make an augmentation cystoplasty in patients with end-stage poorly compliant neuropathic bladder or in exstrophic bladder subjects.\nIntriguing developments in biomaterial science, nanotechnologies, stem cell biology, and further improvements in bioreactor manufacturing will allow to generate, in the near future, tissue engineered organs that, as for structure/function so the native one-like, might represent the optimum solution to replace organs in tumor surgery.", "journal": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "date": "2013-04-02", "authors": ["CAlberti"], "doi": null}

The foramina coexisted with multiple Wormian bones in several sites of the skull. On the inner parietal bone surface, the anterior, posterior and lateral foramina's rims carried grooves, which were continuous with the middle meningeal vessels' branches, indicating that a rich vascular network existed around the foramina. These vascular grooves also notched the external table at the margin of the foramina, which suggests a potential communication between the meningeal and the scalp vessels. In addition, this vascular variation should be taken into consideration when performing surgical interventions in the area, because the large vascular supply to the foramina is a possible source of extensive bleeding.

As tissues become larger, thicker and more complex, the vascular network becomes crucial for supplying nutrients and maintaining viability and growth of the neo-organ. Perfusion decellularization, the process of removing cells from an entire organ, leaves the matrix of the vascular network intact. Organ engineering requires a delicate process of decellularization, sterilization, reseeding with appropriate cells, and organ maturation and stimulation to ensure optimal development.

The first reported 3D muscle constructs have been made many years ago and pioneers in the field are Vandenburgh and colleagues (2,3). Advances made in muscle tissue engineering are not only the result from the vast gain in knowledge of biochemical factors, stem cells and progenitor cells, but are in particular based on insights gained by researchers that physical factors play essential roles in the control of cell behavior and tissue development. State-of-the-art engineered muscle constructs currently consist of cell-populated hydrogel constructs. In our lab these generally consist of murine myoblast progenitor cells, isolated from murine hind limb muscles or a murine myoblast cell line C2C12, mixed with a mixture of collagen/Matrigel and plated between two anchoring points, mimicking the muscle ligaments. Other cells may be considered as well, e.g. alternative cell lines such as L6 rat myoblasts (4), neonatal muscle derived progenitor cells (5), cells derived from adult muscle tissues from other species such as human (6) or even induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) (7). Cell contractility causes alignment of the cells along the long axis of the construct (8,9) and differentiation of the muscle progenitor cells after approximately one week of culture. Moreover, the application of electrical stimulation can enhance the process of differentiation to some extent (8). Because of its limited size (8 x 2 x 0.5 mm) the complete tissue can be analyzed using confocal microscopy to monitor e.g. viability, differentiation and cell alignment.

Aqueous humor samples of all eyes with corneal stromal edema and keratic precipitates (KPs) after PK, seen at the Singapore National Eye Centre from 2007 to 2010, were analyzed for CMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Their charts were reviewed for demographic data, medical and ocular history, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior segment clinical findings, and therapy.\nOf 11 eligible eyes (11 patients), 7 were CMV positive. All eyes were negative for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus. The 2 groups were similar in age, gender, and previous ocular surgery.

The liver is a vital organ, and the extent of its involvement with metastatic disease is a major determinant of survival. Metastatic cells arriving in the liver via the bloodstream encounter the microenvironment of the hepatic sinusoid. The interactions of the tumor cells with hepatic sinusoidal and extrasinusoidal cells (endothelial, Kupffer, stellate, and inflammatory cells) determine their fate. The sinusoidal cells can have a dual role, sometimes fatal to the tumor cells but also facilitatory to their survival and growth. Adhesion molecules participate in these interactions and may affect their outcome. Bone marrow-derived cells and chemokines also play a part in the early battle for survival of the metastases. Once the tumor cells have arrested and survived the initial onslaught, tumors can grow within the liver in 3 distinct patterns, reflecting differing host responses, mechanisms of vascularization, and proteolytic activity.

{"title": "UBIAD1-mediated vitamin K2 synthesis is required for vascular endothelial cell survival and development.", "abstract": "Multi-organ animals, such as vertebrates, require the development of a closed vascular system to ensure the delivery of nutrients to, and the transport of waste from, their organs. As a result, an organized vascular network that is optimal for tissue perfusion is created through not only the generation of new blood vessels but also the remodeling and maintenance of endothelial cells via apoptotic and cell survival pathways. Here, we show that UBIAD1, a vitamin K2/menaquinone-4 biosynthetic enzyme, functions cell-autonomously to regulate endothelial cell survival and maintain vascular homeostasis. From a recent vascular transgene-assisted zebrafish forward genetic screen, we have identified a ubiad1 mutant, reddish/reh, which exhibits cardiac edema as well as cranial hemorrhages and vascular degeneration owing to defects in endothelial cell survival. These findings are further bolstered by the expression of UBIAD1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human heart tissue, as well as the rescue of the reh cardiac and vascular phenotypes with either zebrafish or human UBIAD1. Furthermore, we have discovered that vitamin K2, which is synthesized by UBIAD1, can also rescue the reh vascular phenotype but not the reh cardiac phenotype. Additionally, warfarin-treated zebrafish, which have decreased active vitamin K, display similar vascular degeneration as reh mutants, but exhibit normal cardiac function. Overall, these findings reveal an essential role for UBIAD1-generated vitamin K2 to maintain endothelial cell survival and overall vascular homeostasis; however, an alternative UBIAD1/vitamin K-independent pathway may regulate cardiac function.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2013-03-28", "authors": ["Jeffrey MHegarty", "HongboYang", "Neil CChi"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.093112"}

This study compared the angiogenic potential of ADSC sheets containing dissociated ECs (non-prevascular cell-sheets) and networked ECs (prevascular cell-sheets) after transplantation. For preparing the two different types of ECs-containing layered cell-sheets, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were sandwiched between two human ADSC sheets. Non-prevascular cell-sheets were obtained immediately after sandwiching without further cultivation. Prevascular cell-sheets were harvested form temperature-responsive culture dishes following re-cultivation for allowing them to form an EC network structure. In transplant experiments in the subcutaneous tissues of immune-deficient rat for 4 days, prevascular cell-sheets were observed to promote neovascularization with HUVEC-lined microvessels. In contrast, neovessels were hardly observed in non-prevascular cell-sheets.

The healing process of the burnt wound is extremely complex, as it requires a well-coordinated collaboration among different tissues and cellular strings. From the morphological point of view, the stages of the repairing process of the skin wounds include processes of inflammation, proliferation and tissular remodeling. Angiogenesis has a role of extreme importance within the healing process of third-degree skin burns. That is because the vascularization remake is necessary for feeding the tissue of granulation with nutritive substances and oxygen. The angiogenesis started relatively fast. Three days after the producing of the burn, there could be identified strings of CD34+ endothelial precursor cells at the edges and deep into the wound, all these having contact with the normal blood vessels or with those lees affected by the thermal aggression. After the lumenization of the newly-formed capillary vessels, there appeared the pericytes within their membrane. The CD34+ endothelial precursor cells (EPc), as well as the pericytes, participate at the synthesis of the base membrane of the angiogenesis vessels. The density of the angiogenesis vessels on the surface unit within the tissue of granulation grew from three to 12 days. After that, they reduced progressively while the tissue of granulation was becoming mature.

{"title": "The choroid as a sclera growth regulator.", "abstract": "Emmetropization is a vision dependent mechanism that attempts to minimize refractive error through coordinated growth of the cornea, lens and sclera such that the axial length matches the focal length of the eye. It is generally accepted that this visually guided eye growth is controlled via a cascade of locally generated chemical events that are initiated in the retina and ultimately cause changes in scleral extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling which lead to changes in eye size and refraction. Of much interest, therefore, are the molecular mechanisms that underpin emmetropization and visually guided ocular growth. The choroid, a highly vascularized layer located between the retina and the sclera is uniquely situated to relay retina-derived signals to the sclera to effect changes in ECM synthesis and ocular size. Studies initiated by Josh Wallman clearly demonstrate that the choroid plays an active role in emmetropization, both by modulation of its thickness to adjust the retina to the focal plane of the eye (choroidal accommodation), and well as through the release of growth factors that have the potential to regulate scleral extracellular matrix remodeling. His discoveries prompted numerous investigations on the molecular composition of the choroid and changes in gene expression associated with visually guided ocular growth. This article will review molecular and functional studies of the choroid to provide support for the hypothesis that the choroid is a source of sclera growth regulators that effect changes in ocular growth in response to visual stimuli.", "journal": "Experimental eye research", "date": "2013-03-27", "authors": ["Jody ASummers"], "doi": "10.1016/j.exer.2013.03.008"}

In the present study, 259 uterine cervix tissues, including cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial lesions and carcinomas, were analyzed for RKIP expression by immunohistochemistry.

Following in vitro downregulation of RKIP, we observed a viability and proliferative advantage of RKIP-inhibited cells over time, which was associated with an altered cell cycle distribution and higher colony number in a colony formation assay. An in vitro wound healing assay showed that RKIP abrogation is associated with increased migratory capability. RKIP downregulation was also associated with an increased vascularization of the tumors in vivo using a CAM assay.

{"title": "An in vivo assay to test blood vessel permeability.", "abstract": "This method is based on the intravenous injection of Evans Blue in mice as the test animal model. Evans blue is a dye that binds albumin. Under physiologic conditions the endothelium is impermeable to albumin, so Evans blue bound albumin remains restricted within blood vessels. In pathologic conditions that promote increased vascular permeability endothelial cells partially lose their close contacts and the endothelium becomes permeable to small proteins such as albumin. This condition allows for extravasation of Evans Blue in tissues. A healthy endothelium prevents extravasation of the dye in the neighboring vascularized tissues. Organs with increased permeability will show significantly increased blue coloration compared to organs with intact endothelium. The level of vascular permeability can be assessed by simple visualization or by quantitative measurement of the dye incorporated per milligram of tissue of control versus experimental animal/tissue. Two powerful aspects of this assay are its simplicity and quantitative characteristics. Evans Blue dye can be extracted from tissues by incubating a specific amount of tissue in formamide. Evans Blue absorbance maximum is at 620 nm and absorbance minimum is at 740 nm. By using a standard curve for Evans Blue, optical density measurements can be converted into milligram dye captured per milligram of tissue. Statistical analysis should be used to assess significant differences in vascular permeability.", "journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "date": "2013-03-26", "authors": ["MariaRadu", "JonathanChernoff"], "doi": "10.3791/50062"}

Various donor sites are available to provide vascularized bone grafts for mandibular reconstruction such as the fibula flap, the iliac flap, and the scapula flap; the fibula flap has become the most popular workhorse flap to reconstruct the lower jaw for extensive surgical defects. It is a challenge for head and neck reconstructive surgeons if the patient (mostly the manual worker) refuses to use fibular flap to reconstruct an extensive mandible defect or the patients have contraindication to harvest fibular flap. We have performed 7 cases using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing prefabricated titanium mesh combined with autogenous iliac cancellous bone graft plus with/without boiled nontumorous mandible bone to reconstruct such cases. Primary wound healing was achieved in all patients without complication, and reconstructive complications were not observed during the follow-up period.

{"title": "Anterior pericranial flap for frontal sinus duct obliteration: is it a valuable resource?", "abstract": "Inappropriate treatments of frontal sinus fractures may lead to serious complications, such as mucopyocele, meningitis, and brain abscess. Assessment of nasofrontal duct injury is crucial, and nasofrontal duct injury requires sinus obliteration, which is often accomplished by autogenous grafts such as fat, muscle, or bone. These avascular grafts have an increased risk of resorption and infection and donor site morbidity. For these reasons, pericranial flap, which is vascular, should be used for frontal sinus obliteration. The pericranial flap presented with less morbidity procedure and has decreased infection rates, which justifies its use in frontal sinus obliteration. This study aimed to report a case of a comminuted frontal sinus fracture with a brief literature review, regarding the use of pericranial flap. The authors report a case of a 23-year-old male subject with a severely comminuted fracture of the anterior and posterior walls of the frontal sinus. The patient was successfully treated by cranialization with frontal sinus duct obliteration, using anterior pericranial flap. The patient was followed up for 16 months with no postoperative complication, such as infection. Pericranial flap is a good resource for frontal sinus duct obliteration because it is a durable and well-vascularized flap, which determines low rates of postoperative complications.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2013-03-26", "authors": ["Willian Moraisde Melo", "Juliana ZorziCol\u00e9te", "Ronaldo C\u00e9lioMariano", "Elio HitoshiShinohara", "Francisley \u00c1vilaSouza", "Idelmo RangelGarcia"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e31827c7ff2"}

Text books continue to perpetuate that such flaps are poorly vascularized and may not survive if longer than 1.5 cm. The rationale of our study was to challenge the traditional thoughts about the turn-in flaps for the lining and describe our modified technique of raising these flaps so that well-vascularized thin tissue can be provided for the lining. The study was conducted at the Department of Plastic Surgery, KEMU, Lahore, from January 2007 to March 2011. Eighteen patients were included. They had posttraumatic full-thickness nasal defect of variable extent, involving the lower third of the nose. In the first stage of reconstruction, the epithelialized portion and 5-mm portion of normal adjoining skin were dermabraded. The residual skin of nasal dorsum, side walls, and alae was turned in to form inner lining of 2 nostrils. These flaps were based on healthy dermabraded skin to ensure adequate blood supply. Residual septal and conchal cartilages were used for primary support. Standard ipsilateral paramedian forehead flap with slight oblique design was used for resurfacing. Final assessment of airway patency and alar rim contour was made by the patient at 6 months as satisfactory, just satisfactory, and not satisfactory. There were 12 female and 6 male patients. There was necrosis of distal portion of the forehead flap in 1 case. Partial graft loss at the donor site with bone exposure was noted in another case. There was partial dehiscence and necrosis of turndown flap in 3cases. Mean flap size was 2.05 \u00b1 0.28 cm. As regards airway patency, 12 patients were satisfied, 4 patients were just satisfied, and 2 patients were unsatisfied. When asked about alar rim contour, 3 patients said it to be satisfactory, 9 patients found it just satisfactory, and 6 patients declared it unsatisfactory.

{"title": "In vivo response to dynamic hyaluronic acid hydrogels.", "abstract": "Tissue-specific elasticity arises in part from developmental changes in extracellular matrix over time, e.g. ~10-fold myocardial stiffening in the chicken embryo. When this time-dependent stiffening has been mimicked in vitro with thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) hydrogels, improved cardiomyocyte maturation has been observed. However, host interactions, matrix polymerization, and the stiffening kinetics remain uncertain in vivo, and each plays a critical role in therapeutic applications using HA-SH. Hematological and histological analysis of subcutaneously injected HA-SH hydrogels showed minimal systemic immune response and host cell infiltration. Most importantly, subcutaneously injected HA-SH hydrogels exhibited time-dependent porosity and stiffness changes at a rate similar to hydrogels polymerized in vitro. When injected intramyocardially host cells begin to actively degrade HA-SH hydrogels within 1week post-injection, continuing this process while producing matrix to nearly replace the hydrogel within 1month post-injection. While non-thiolated HA did not degrade after injection into the myocardium, it also did not elicit an immune response, unlike HA-SH, where visible granulomas and macrophage infiltration were present 1month post-injection, likely due to reactive thiol groups. Altogether these data suggest that the HA-SH hydrogel responds appropriately in a less vascularized niche and stiffens as had been demonstrated in vitro, but in more vascularized tissues, in vivo applicability appears limited.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-03-26", "authors": ["Jennifer LYoung", "JeremyTuler", "RebeccaBraden", "PamelaSch\u00fcp-Magoffin", "JacquelynSchaefer", "KyleKretchmer", "Karen LChristman", "Adam JEngler"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.03.019"}

Yet the role of vascularization in osteoporosis and osteoporotic bone repair mechanisms is unclear. Here we investigated effects of osteoporotic phenotype on vascularization during bone defect healing in a rodent osteotomy model using volumetric computed tomography (VCT), dynamic contrast-enhanced VCT (DCE-VCT), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and histology. In 16 rats, 8 with physiological bone status (SHAM) and 8 with osteoporotic bone status induced by ovariectomy (OVX) in combination with a vitamin D- and low calcium diet, wedge-shaped defects were created at the left distal femur and stabilized internally by T-shaped miniplate. MRI and VCT were performed in all animals 6 weeks after this procedure. By VCT, relative bone density in the defect was evaluated. Using DCE-VCT and DCE-MRI, parameters associated with regional blood volume were calculated in the bone defect, vicinity of the defect, surrounding muscles and bone marrow: Amplitude A and exchange rate constant Kep (DCE-MRI, respectively) as well as peak enhancement PE and area under the curve AUC (DCE-VCT, respectively). In animals of osteoporotic phenotype, bone density within the osseous defect was significantly reduced as compared to SHAM rats. Vascularization parameters determined by DCE-MRI and DCE-VCT in the defect were significantly elevated compared to the adjacent tissues for both SHAM and OVX groups. However, comparing SHAM and OVX rats, no statistically different values were found by DCE-MRI and DCE-VCT concerning any determined vascularization parameter within the bone defect. Furthermore, parameters of vascularization were increased for OVX as compared to SHAM rats within the bone marrow although significant difference was only found for A. In a rat osteotomy model we showed that at the reparative healing stage, osteoporotic phenotype did influence osteogenic but not angiogenic response within bone defect as imaged by DCE-MRI and DCE-VCT.

In the present work, we tested the relative effect of short- or long-term exposure to high altitude hypobaric hypoxia and oxidative stress on corpora luteal structure and function.\nThe growth dynamics of the corpora lutea during the estrous cycle were studied daily by ultrasonography in cycling sheep that were either native or na\u00efve to high-altitude conditions and that were supplemented or not supplemented with antioxidant vitamins. Arterial and venous blood samples were simultaneously drawn for determination of gases and oxidative stress biomarkers and progesterone measurement. On day five after ovulation in the next cycle, the ovaries were removed for immunodetection of luteal HIF-1alpha and VEGF and IGF-I and to detect IGF-II gene expression.\nThe results showed that both short- and long-term exposure to high-altitude conditions decreased luteal growth and IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression but increased HIF-1 alpha and VEGF immunoexpression. The level of plasma progesterone was also increased at a high altitude, although an association with increased corpus luteum vascularization was only found in sheep native to a high-altitude location. Administration of antioxidant vitamins resulted in a limited effect, which was restricted to decreased expression of oxidative stress biomarkers and luteal HIF-1alpha and VEGF immunoexpression.\nExposure of the sheep to high-altitude hypobaric hypoxia for short or long time periods affects the development and function of the corpus luteum. Moreover, the observed association of oxidative stress with hypoxia and the absence of any significant effect of antioxidant vitamins on most anatomical and functional corpus luteum traits suggests that the effects of high altitude on this ovarian structure are mainly mediated by hypoxia.

Moreover, osteogenic and angiogenic factors are required to promote differentiation and survival of hMSC through improved vascularization through the damaged extracellular matrix (ECM). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are ECM compounds acting as modulators of heparin-binding protein activities during bone development and regenerative processes. GAG mimetics have been proposed as ECM stabilizers and were previously described for their positive effects on bone formation and angiogenesis after local treatment. Here, we developed a strategy associating the GAG mimetic [OTR4120] with bone substitutes to optimize stem cell-based therapeutic products. We showed that [OTR4120] was able to potentiate proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of hMSC in vitro. Its link to tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite scaffolds improved their colonization by hMSC. Surprisingly, when these combinations were tested in an ectopic model of bone formation in immunodeficient mice, the GAG mimetics inhibit bone formation induced by hMSC and promoted an osteoclastic activity. Moreover, the inflammatory response was modulated, and the peri-implant vascularization stimulated. All together, these findings further support the ability of GAG mimetics to organize the local ECM to coordinate the host response toward the implanted biomaterial, and to inhibit the abnormal bone formation process on a subcutaneous ectopic site.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "The human lung during the embryonic period: vasculogenesis and primitive erythroblasts circulation.", "abstract": "Vascularization and blood cell circulation are crucial steps during lung development. However, how blood vessels are generated and when lung circulation is initiated is still a matter of debate. A morpho-functional analysis of pulmonary vasculature was done using human lung samples between 31 and 56 days post-fertilization (pf). The immunolocalization and expression of CD31, CD34, FLT-1, KDR and the vascular growth factor (VEGF) were investigated. The results showed that at day 31 pf, a capillary plexus is already installed, and a few primitive erythroblasts were seen for the first time within the lumen of some blood vessels. Around day 45 pf, an increase in the amount of primitive erythroblasts was detected in the parenchyma surrounding the distal segment of the bronchial tree. The expression of FLT-1, KDR, CD31 and CD34 was observed in endothelial cells of the capillary plexus and the VEGF was detected in the endodermal epithelium. Our results support the hypothesis that the initial formation of the capillary plexus around the tip of the growing airway bud occurs by vasculogenesis, probably regulated by VEGF and KDR. We also showed a very early onset of blood circulation, starting from day 34 pf, concomitant with the generation of new lung buds.

We evaluated in vitro the expression of LHRH receptors, proliferation, apoptosis and the release of oncogenic and tumor suppressor cytokines. Clinical and U-87 MG samples of glioblastoma tumors expressed LHRH receptors. Treatment of nude mice with AN-152, once a week at an intravenous dose of 413 nmol/20 g, for six weeks resulted in 76 % reduction in tumor growth. AN-152 nearly completely abolished tumor progression and elicited remarkable apoptosis in vitro.

{"title": "Indocyanine green fluorescence in the assessment of the quality of the pedicled intercostal muscle flap: a pilot study.", "abstract": "The pedicled intercostal muscle flap (IMF) is a high quality vascularized tissue commonly used to buttress the bronchial stump after pneumonectomy or bronchial anastomosis after sleeve lobectomy in order to prevent bronchopleural fistula formation. The evaluation of the viability of the muscle flap is difficult. The aim of this study was the assessment of the application of indicyanine green fluorescence for the evaluation of IMF perfusion.\nThe study included 27 patients (10 males and 17 females), mean age 62.6 years (47-77 years). Indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) was used for objective assessment of the IMF quality by a near-infrared camera system (Photodynamic Eye(\u00ae), Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). The following factors that may have an impact on the quality of the IMF were assessed: age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, IMF length and thickness and timing of the harvesting during the procedure.\nThe following surgical pulmonary resections with IMF harvesting were performed: 12 pneumonectomies, 2 sleeve lobectomies and 13 lobectomies. Intercostal muscle flap (IMF) was harvested before rib spreader insertion in 23 patients (85%) and at the end of the surgery in 4 patients (15%). The mean length and thickness of the harvested intercostal muscle were 19.9 \u00b1 2.9 cm (range 13-24 cm) and 2.4 cm \u00b1 0.7 cm (range 1.0-3.5 cm), respectively. Indocyanine green angiography showed ischaemia in the distal part of the muscle in all cases, despite the lack of obvious macroscopic signs. Median length of the ischaemic part was 4 cm (range 0.5-20 cm). The IMF length and thickness had a significant impact on the length of the ischaemic segment. In 24 patients, the ischaemic part of the muscle flap was severed. In 3 patients with the longest ischaemic segment (11, 13 and 20 cm), an alternative tissue was used to cover the bronchial stump. No major complications occurred.\nOur preliminary results confirmed the simplicity and high efficacy of ICG in the assessment of intercostal muscle blood perfusion.

{"title": "Four decades of vascularized heterotopic cardiac transplantation in the mouse.", "abstract": "Since the first clinical heart transplant in 1967, there has been a heightened need to understand immune and inflammatory responses to \"foreign\" tissues. Research efforts in those early days were based on species that would now be considered \"large\" and were typically out-bred individuals. While this closely mirrors the clinical scenario, where genetic mismatches of donors and recipients can only be minimized in the selection process, these were not ideal models for studying the complexities and nuances of the immune system. Even when the rat was considered the standard model those early endeavors were limited by a small number of rat strains. The mouse model has provided us with an overwhelming array of strains, knockouts, knockins and transgenics that allow us to investigate the many layers of the innate and adaptive immune systems leading to a much greater understanding of immune responses. Fully vascularized heterotopic cardiac transplantation in the mouse has now been with us for four decades; the original papers describing this technique being published by Corry in 1973. In the subsequent 40 years, this technique has been used by many laboratories, including our own, and has become a powerful tool for the investigation of transplant immunity and ischemia reperfusion injury. Given the modern availability of mouse strains and mouse-related reagents, our current understanding of transplant immunity undoubtedly would not exist without such a technique.", "journal": "Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research", "date": "2013-03-22", "authors": ["Robert JPlenter", "Martin RZamora", "Todd JGrazia"], "doi": "10.3109/08941939.2012.755238"}

GBM is one of the most vascularized tumors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by tumor cells is a major factor regulating angiogenesis. Successful results of preclinical studies of anti-angiogenic therapies using xenograft mouse models of human GBM cell lines encouraged clinical studies of anti-angiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab (Avastin), an anti-VEGF antibody. However, these clinical studies have shown that most patients become resistant to anti-VEGF therapy after an initial response. Recent studies have revealed some resistance mechanisms against anti-VEGF therapies involved in several types of cancer. In this review, we address mechanisms of angiogenesis, including unique features in GBMs, and resistance to anti-VEGF therapies frequently observed in GBM. Enhanced invasiveness is one such resistance mechanism and recent works report the contribution of activated MET signaling induced by inhibition of VEGF signaling. On the other hand, tumor cell-originated neovascularization including tumor-derived endothelial cell-induced angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry has been suggested to be involved in the resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, these mechanisms should be targeted in addition to anti-angiogenic therapies to achieve better results for patients with GBM.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2013-03-21", "authors": ["YasushiSoda", "ChadMyskiw", "AmyRommel", "Inder MVerma"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-013-1019-z\n10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19960115)77:2<362::aid-cncr20>3.0.co;2-z\n10.1172/jci14105\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.02.019\n10.1586/14737175.6.8.1199\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.06.030\n10.1038/nature04478\n10.1038/nm871\n10.1182/blood-2003-11-3952\n10.1038/nm1200\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-05-3759\n10.1038/nature09557\n10.1038/nature09624\n10.1073/pnas.1016030108\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6690291\n10.1038/nature05571\n10.1038/nature08995\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-07-0969\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-11-1704\n10.1038/nature05355\n10.1038/nature05313\n10.1172/jci115516\n10.1111/j.1750-3639.2008.00137.x\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2390\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4199\n10.1023/A:1023367223575\n10.1038/nrc2442\n10.1038/359845a0\n10.1155/2012/483040\n10.1158/0008-5472.can-06-1010\n10.1586/era.12.13\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2309\n10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3055\n10.1517/14712598.2012.694422\n10.1200/JCO.2010.30.2729\n10.1007/s11060-008-9745-8\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-252\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.11.021\n10.1007/s11060-010-0402-7\n10.1007/s11060-011-0631-4\n10.1007/s11060-009-9976-3\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.3988\n10.1212/01.wnl.0000304121.57857.38\n10.3171/2008.4.17492\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181bc0184\n10.1093/neuonc/nop027\n10.3171/2011.9.JNS11656\n10.1007/s11060-010-0251-4\n10.1016/j.ccr.2008.01.034\n10.1215/15228517-2008-061\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.01.027\n10.1038/nrc3205\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0240\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.05.037\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.060223\n10.1002/ijc.25249\n10.1016/j.prp.2011.07.012\n10.1093/brain/awq044\n10.1007/s12032-010-9765-z\n10.1074/jbc.M111.334540\n10.1007/s11060-011-0578-5\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.01.001\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.02.018\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.11.020\n10.1002/ana.23674\n10.1002/cncr.20397\n10.1073/pnas.131209798\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64922-X\n10.1016/j.canlet.2006.08.016\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2017-12.2012\n10.1074/jbc.M112.417451\n10.1084/jem.20111424\n10.1161/01.RES.0000089257.94002.96\n10.1002/stem.429\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605551\n10.1016/j.bbr.2011.08.002\n10.1016/j.devcel.2005.09.010\n10.1016/j.stem.2011.02.006\n10.1126/science.1226929"}

Their metabolic profile is also different, with an increased anaerobic glycolytic metabolism in cells harbouring codon 12 KRAS mutations compared with cells containing codon 13 mutations. We hypothesized that this distinct metabolic behaviour could be associated with different HIF-1\u03b1 expression and a distinct angiogenic profile.\nCodon13 KRAS mutation (ASP13) or codon12 KRAS mutation (CYS12) NIH3T3 transfectants were analyzed in vitro and in vivo.

Vascular network was assessed in tumors growing after subcutaneous inoculation. Non parametric statistics were used for analysis of results.\nOur results show that in normoxic conditions ASP13 transfectants exhibited less HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels and activity than CYS12. In contrast, codon 13 transfectants exhibited higher VEGF-A mRNA and protein levels and enhanced VEGF-A promoter activity. These differences were due to a differential activation of Sp1/AP2 transcription elements of the VEGF-A promoter associated with increased ERKs signalling in ASP13 transfectants.

{"title": "Influence of crosslinking on the stiffness and degradation of dermis-derived hydrogels.", "abstract": "Natural hydrogels have been investigated for three-dimensional tissue reconstruction and regeneration given their ability to emulate the structural complexity of multi-component extracellular matrices (ECM). Hydrogels rich in ECM can be extracted and assembled from soft tissues, retain a composition specific to the tissue source, and stimulate vascularized tissue formation. However, poor mechanical properties and rapid degradation hinder their performance in regenerative applications. This study investigates the effect of glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking on the mechanical properties, biological activity, and degradation of dermis-isolated ECM-rich hydrogels. Compression tests indicated that hydrogel elastic moduli and yield stress values increased significantly with GA exposure time. Lyophilization was shown to decrease yield stress values with respect to non-lyophilized gels. Crosslinked ECM, unlike non-crosslinked gels, was resistant to pepsin degradation in vitro. In a rodent subcutaneous implant model, crosslinking for 0.5 hours or longer drastically slowed degradation relative to controls. Inflammation was low and mature vascularized granulation tissue was observed in all gels, with an increase in vessel density at 1 week in crosslinked gels relative to controls. These results support the potential use of dermis-derived hydrogels as materials for tissue engineering applications and suggest that crosslinking can enhance mechanical properties and prolong hydrogel lifetime while promoting vascularized tissue formation.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Mechanical properties and cytotoxicity of a resorbable bioactive implant prepared by rapid prototyping technique.", "abstract": "Bioceramic processing using rapid prototyping technique (RPT) results in a fragile device that requires thermal treatment to improve the mechanical properties. This investigation evaluates the effect of thermal treatment on the mechanical, porosity, and bioactivity properties as well as the cytotoxicity of a porous silica-calcium phosphate nanocomposite (SCPC) implant prepared by RPT. Porous SCPC implant was subject to 3-h treatment at 800\u00b0C, 850\u00b0C, or 900\u00b0C. The compressive strength (s) and modulus of elasticity (E) were doubled when the sintering temperature is raised from 850 to 900\u00b0C measuring (s = 15.326 \u00b1 2.95 MPa and E = 1095 \u00b1 164 MPa) after the later treatment. The significant increase in mechanical properties takes place with minimal changes in the surface area and the percentage of pores in the range 1-356 \u03bcm. The SCPC implant prepared at 900\u00b0C was loaded with rh-BMP-2 and grafted into a segmental defect in the rabbit ulna. Histology analyses showed highly vascularized bone formation inside the defect. Histopathological analyses of the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and the lung of rabbits grafted with and without SCPC demonstrated healthy tissues with no signs of toxicity or morphology alterations. Results of the study suggest that it is possible to engineering the mechanical properties of the SCPC implant without compromising its bioactivity. The enhanced bone formation inside the porous SCPC facilitated cell-mediated graft resorption and prohibited any accumulation of the material in the body organs.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

In patients suffering with AUB, the blood vessels of the endometrium are hypertrophic, whereas in the case of CA vascularization is irregular or anarchic. In this paper, a methodology for the classification of hysteroscopical images of endometrium using vessel and texture features is presented. A total of 28 patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, 10 patients with endometrial cancer and 39 subjects with no pathological condition were imaged. 16 of the patients with AUB were premenopausal and 12 postmenopausal, all with CA were postmenopausal, and all with no pathological condition were premenopausal. All images were examined for the appearance of endometrial vessels and non-vascular structures. For each image, 167 texture and vessel's features were initially extracted, which were reduced after feature selection in only 4 features. The images were classified into three categories using artificial neural networks and the reported classification accuracy was 91.2\u00a0%, while the specificity and sensitivity were 83.8 and 93.6\u00a0% respectively.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2013-03-19", "authors": ["Alexandra AVlachokosta", "Pantelis AAsvestas", "FaniGkrozou", "LazarosLavasidis", "George KMatsopoulos", "MinasPaschopoulos"], "doi": "10.1007/s11517-013-1058-1"}
{"title": "Ultrasound for diagnosing acute salpingitis: a prospective observational diagnostic study.", "abstract": "What are the diagnostic benefits of using ultrasound in patients with a clinical suspicion of acute salpingitis and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)?\nIn patients with a clinical suspicion of acute salpingitis, the absence of bilateral adnexal masses at ultrasound decreases the odds of mild-to-severe acute salpingitis about five times, while the presence of bilateral adnexal masses increases the odds about five times.\nPID is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are often subtle and mild. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings, and these are unspecific. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound with regard to salpingitis have been reported in one study (n = 30) of appropriate design, where most patients had severe salpingitis (i.e. pyosalpinx) or tubo-ovarian abscess.\nThis diagnostic test study included 52 patients fulfilling the clinical criteria of PID. Patients were recruited between October 1999 and August 2008.\nThe patients underwent a standardized transvaginal gray scale and Doppler ultrasound examination by one experienced sonologist (index test) before diagnostic laparoscopy by a laparoscopist blinded to the ultrasound results. The final diagnosis was determined by laparoscopy, histology of the endometrium and other histology where relevant (reference standard).\nOf the 52 patients, 23 (44%) had a final diagnosis unrelated to genital infection, while the other 29 had cervicitis (n = 3), endometritis (n = 9) or salpingitis (n = 17; mild n = 4, moderate n = 8, severe, i.e. pyosalpinx n = 5). Bilateral adnexal masses and bilateral masses lying adjacent to the ovary were seen more often on ultrasound in patients with salpingitis than with other diagnoses (bilateral adnexal masses: 82 versus 17%, i.e. 14/17 versus 6/35, P = 0.000, positive likelihood ratio 4.8, negative likelihood ratio 0.22; bilateral masses adjacent to ovary: 65 versus 17%, i.e.11/17 versus 6/35, P = 0.001, positive likelihood ratio 3.8, negative likelihood ratio 0.42). In cases of salpingitis, the masses lying adjacent to the ovaries were on average 2-3 cm in diameter, solid (n = 14), unilocular cystic (n = 4), multilocular cystic (n = 3) or multilocular solid (n = 1), with thick walls and well vascularized at colour Doppler. In no case were the cogwheel sign or incomplete septae seen. All 13 cases of moderate or severe salpingitis were diagnosed with ultrasound (detection rate 100%, 95% confidence interval 78-100%) compared with 1 of 4 cases of mild salpingitis. Three of six cases of appendicitis, and two of two ovarian cysts were correctly diagnosed with ultrasound, and one case of adnexal torsion was suspected and then verified at laparoscopy.\nThe sample size is small. This is explained by difficulties with patient recruitment. There are few cases of mild salpingitis, which means that we cannot estimate with any precision the ability of ultrasound to detect very early salpingitis. The proportion of cases with salpingitis of different grade affects the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound, and the sensitivity and specificity that we report here are applicable only to patient populations similar to ours.\nThe information provided by transvaginal ultrasound is likely to be of help when deciding whether or not to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with symptoms and signs suggesting PID and, if laparoscopy is not performed, to select treatment and plan follow-up.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2013-03-19", "authors": ["GRomosan", "CBjartling", "LSkoog", "LValentin"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/det065"}

This study investigated the effect of cobalt oxide (CoO) doped into titanium phosphate glasses on material properties, biocompatibility and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by osteoblastic MG63 cells. Glasses composed of (P2O5)45(Na2O)20(TiO2)05(CaO)30-x(CoO)x(x=0, 5, 10, and 15 mol%) were fabricated and the effect of Co on physicochemical properties including density, glass transition temperature (Tg), degradation rate, ion release, and pH changes was assessed. The results showed that incorporation of CoO into the glass system produced an increase in density with little change in Tg. It was then confirmed that the pH did not change significantly when CoO was incorporated in the glass, and stayed constant at around 6.5-7.0 throughout the dissolution study period of 336 h. Ion release results followed a specific pattern with increasing amounts of CoO. In general, although incorporation of CoO into a titanium phosphate glass increased its density, other bulk and surface properties of the glass did not show any significant changes. Cell culture studies performed using MG63 cells over a 7-day period indicated that the glasses provide a stable surface for cell attachment and are biocompatible. Furthermore, VEGF secretion was significantly enhanced on all glasses compared with standard tissue culture plastic and Co doping enhanced this effect further.

This study is the first in a series that hypothesizes that these complications can be minimized through the insetting of a vascularized plantar free flap (VPFF) on the amputee stump. Using three hip disarticulated cadaver specimens, a VPFF was designed, dissected, and implanted on one transfemoral and two transtibial stumps. Using accepted vascular anastomosis techniques, the posterior tibial artery was anastomosed to the distal femoral or popliteal artery with corresponding anastomoses for venous drainage. In addition, the possibility of a limited to partial sensate flap may be created with a neurorrhaphy of the associated nerves. This potentially sensate area would provide plantar skin that aids the existing local sensate flap used to close the defect. It is hypothesized that this procedure offers significant rehabilitative and long-term benefits to battlefield or other acute causes for lower extremity amputation.

{"title": "Does low gas permeability of rigid-shelled gekkotan eggs affect embryonic development?", "abstract": "Parchment-shelled eggs are characteristic of most squamates, including the basal clades of gekkotan lizards. The majority of gekkotan lizards, however, produce rigid-shelled eggs that are highly impermeable to gas exchange; eggs are laid in dry sites and experience a net loss of water during incubation. We tested the hypothesis that the 1,000-fold lower rate of oxygen diffusion through the shells of rigid- compared to parchment-shelled eggs imposes a physiological cost on development. To do this, we contrasted species with rigid and with parchment shells with regards to (1) rates of embryonic metabolism and (2) rates and patterns of development of the yolk sac and chorioallantois, the vascularized extra-embryonic membranes that transport oxygen to embryonic tissues. Metabolic rates of embryos from the rigid-shelled eggs of Gehyra variegata did not differ from those of the parchment-shelled eggs of Oedura lesueurii. Moreover, maximum metabolic rates of gekkotans with rigid shells did not differ from those of gekkotan or scincid lizards with parchment shells. In contrast, the yolk sac covered more of the surface area of the egg at oviposition, and the chorioallantois reached its full extent earlier for the species with rigid shelled eggs (Chondrodactylus turneri, G. variegata) than for the species with parchment-shelled eggs (Eublepharis macularius, O. lesueurii). Differences in the temporal patterns of yolk sac and chorioallantois development would thus serve to compensate for low rates of oxygen diffusion through rigid shells of gekkotans.", "journal": "Journal of experimental zoology.

Watertight closure of the sellar dura with a fascial patch graft is a method of choice for preventing CSF leakage; however, suturing and knotting in a deep and narrow operative field is technically challenging and time consuming. To present a simple and effective knotting technique named the 'sliding-lock-knot' technique, in which the knot can easily be slid to the suturing point and tied automatically using only a single string, without loosening.\nWe use a 6-0 nylon suture and Mosquito forceps. At first, after putting a stitch, a single knot is made by hand out of the nasal cavity. Then the 'sliding-lock-knot' is made using a forceps as shown in the illustration. The knot slides deep into the operative field through the nostril and it is automatically tied only by pulling a string.\nA 73-year-old woman presented with progressive visual deterioration.

Modulating the size and density of macropores may promote desirable cellular processes at different stages of tissue development. Most current techniques for fabricating macroporous scaffolds produce fixed macroporosity and do not allow the control of porosity during cell culture. Most macropore-forming techniques also involve non-physiological conditions, such that cells can only be seeded in a post-fabrication process, which often leads to low cell seeding efficiency and uneven cell distribution. Here we report a process to create dynamic hydrogels as tissue engineering scaffolds with tunable macroporosity using stimuli-responsive porogens of gelatin, alginate and hyaluronic acid, which degrade in response to specific stimuli including temperature, chelating and enzymatic digestion, respectively. SEM imaging confirmed sequential pore formation in response to sequential stimulations: 37 \u00b0C on day 0, EDTA on day 7, and hyaluronidase on day 14. Bovine chondrocytes were encapsulated in the Alg porogen, which served as cell-delivery vehicles, and changes in cell viability, proliferation and tissue formation during sequential stimuli treatments were evaluated. Our results showed effective cell release from Alg porogen with high cell viability and markedly increased cell proliferation and spreading throughout the 3D hydrogels. Dynamic pore formation also led to significantly enhanced type II and X collagen production by chondrocytes.

This study assessed the functionality and durability of engineered human vasculatures from endothelial progenitors when implanted in a mouse deep burn-wound model. Human vascular networks, derived from endothelial colony-forming cells in hyaluronic acid hydrogels, were transplanted into third-degree burns. On day 3 following transplantation, macrophages rapidly degraded the hydrogel during a period of inflammation; through the transitions from inflammation to proliferation (days 5-7), the host's vasculatures infiltrated the construct, connecting with the human vessels within the wound area. The growth of mouse vessels near the wound area supported further integration with the implanted human vasculatures. During this period, the majority of the vessels (\u223c60%) in the treated wound area were human. Although no increase in the density of human vessels was detected during the proliferative phase, they temporarily increased in size. This growth peaked at day 7, the middle of the proliferation stage, and then decreased by the end of the proliferation stage.

{"title": "Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 is essential for corneal alymphaticity.", "abstract": "Corneal transparency is a prerequisite for optimal vision and in turn relies on an absence of blood and lymphatic vessels, which is remarkable given the cornea's proximity to vascularized tissues. Membrane-bound vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), with its cognate ligand vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), is a major mediator of lymphangiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the cornea expresses a novel truncated isoform of this molecule, soluble VEGFR-3 (sVEGFR-3), which is critical for corneal alymphaticity, by sequestering VEGF-C. sVEGFR-3 binds and sequesters VEGF-C, thereby blocking signaling through VEGFR-3 and suppressing lymphangiogenesis induced by VEGF-C. sVEGFR-3 knockdown leads to lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis in the mouse cornea, while overexpression of sVEGFR-3 inhibits lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis in a murine suture injury model. Pax6(+/-) mice spontaneously develop corneal and lymphatic vessels and are deficient in sVEGFR-3. sVEGFR-3 suppresses hemangiogenesis by blocking VEGF-C-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Overexpression of sVEGFR-3 leads to a 5-fold increase in corneal transplant survival in mouse models. sVEGFR-3 holds promise as a molecule to control and regress lymphatic-vessel-based dysfunction.

{"title": "Functional ultrasound imaging of the brain: theory and basic principles.", "abstract": "Hemodynamic changes in the brain are often used as surrogates of neuronal activity to infer the loci of brain activity. A major limitation of conventional Doppler ultrasound for the imaging of these changes is that it is not sensitive enough to detect the blood flow in small vessels where the major part of the hemodynamic response occurs. Here, we present a \u03bcDoppler ultrasound method able to detect and map the cerebral blood volume (CBV) over the entire brain with an important increase in sensitivity. This method is based on imaging the brain at an ultrafast frame rate (1 kHz) using compounded plane wave emissions. A theoretical model demonstrates that the gain in sensitivity of the \u03bcDoppler method is due to the combination of 1) the high signal-to-noise ratio of the gray scale images, resulting from the synthetic compounding of backscattered echoes; and 2) the extensive signal averaging enabled by the high temporal sampling of ultrafast frame rates. This \u03bcDoppler imaging is performed in vivo on trepanned rats without the use of contrast agents. The resulting images reveal detailed maps of the rat brain vascularization with an acquisition time as short as 320 ms per slice.

We describe the technique and report our first 16 consecutive cases of vascularized osteocartilaginous arthroplasty for chronic scaphoid proximal pole nonunions using the MFT, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up.\nChart reviews of 16 consecutive cases of osteocartilaginous MFT flap transfers for scaphoid reconstruction were performed at 2 institutions. Follow-up data were recorded at a minimum of 6 months, with an average of 14 months (range, 6-72 mo).

An unexpected role for AHR in vascularization was suggested when mice lacking AHR displayed impaired closure of the ductus venosus after birth, as did knockout mice for aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The resulting intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) are frequently diagnosed in specific dog breeds, such as the Irish wolfhound. We compared the expression of components of the AHR pathway in healthy Irish wolfhounds and dogs with IHPSS. To this end, we analyzed the mRNA expression in the liver of AHR,AIP, ARNT, and other genes involved in this pathway, namely, those for aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2), hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1A), heat shock protein 90AA1 (HSP90AA1), cytochromes P450 (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), nitric oxide synthesase 3 (NOS3), and endothelin (EDN1). The observed low expression of AHR mRNA in the Irish wolfhounds is in associated with a LINE-1 insertion in intron 2, for which these dogs were homozygous. Down regulation in Irish wolfhounds was observed for AIP, ARNT2, CYP1A2, CYP1B1 and HSP90AA1 expression, whereas the expression of HIF1A was increased. Immunohistochemistry revealed lower levels of AHR, HIF1A, and VEGFA protein in the nucleus and lower levels of ARNT and HSP90AA1 protein in the cytoplasm of the liver cells of Irish wolfhounds.

The angiogenic outgrowth consisted of endothelial cells, which actively internalized acetylated-low-density lipoprotein, surrounded by pericytes. Computer-assisted quantification of this vascular network demonstrated considerable sensitivity of this assay to several angiogenic inhibitors, including kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.

Results showed that VEGF infusion as well as enriched environment induced neurovascular and cognitive effects in developing rats. VEGF administration produced an enhancement during the learning process of enriched animals and acted as an angiogenic factor both in primary visual cortex (V1) and dentate gyrus (DG) in order to counteract minipump implantation-induced damage. This fact revealed that DG vascularization is critical for normal learning. In contrast to this enriched environment acted on the neuronal density of the DG and V1 cortex, and results showed learning enhancement only in non-operated rats.

The second patient required mandibular body, ascending ramus and joint reconstruction, performed by transoral vascularized fibula free flap with temporal vessel anastomosis.

{"title": "An optimized ultrasound detector for photoacoustic breast tomography.", "abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging has proven to be able to detect vascularization-driven optical absorption contrast associated with tumors. In order to detect breast tumors located a few centimeter deep in tissue, a sensitive ultrasound detector is of crucial importance for photoacoustic mammography. Further, because the expected photoacoustic frequency bandwidth (a few MHz to tens of kHz) is inversely proportional to the dimensions of light absorbing structures (0.5-10+ mm), proper choices of materials and their geometries and proper considerations in design have to be made to implement optimal photoacoustic detectors. In this study, we design and evaluate a specialized ultrasound detector for photoacoustic mammography.\nBased on the required detector sensitivity and its frequency response, a selection of active material and matching layers and their geometries is made leading to functional detector models. By iteration between simulation of detector performances, fabrication and experimental characterization of functional models an optimized implementation is made and evaluated. For computer simulation, we use 1D Krimholtz-Leedom-Matthaei and 3D finite-element based models.\nThe experimental results of the designed first and second functional detectors matched with the simulations. In subsequent bare piezoelectric samples the effect of lateral resonances was addressed and their influence minimized by subdicing the samples. Consequently, using simulations, a final optimized detector was designed, with a center frequency of 1 MHz and a -6 dB bandwidth of 0.4-1.25 MHz (fractional bandwidth of ~80%). The minimum detectable pressure was measured to be 0.5 Pa.\nA single-element, large-aperture, sensitive, and broadband detector is designed and developed for photoacoustic tomography of the breast. The detector should be capable of detecting vascularized tumors with 1-2 mm resolution. The minimum detectable pressure is 0.5 Pa, which will facilitate deeper imaging compared to the current systems. Further improvements by proper electrical grounding and shielding and implementation of this design into an arrayed detector will pave the way for clinical applications of photoacoustic mammography.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2013-03-08", "authors": ["WenfengXia", "DanielePiras", "Johan C Gvan Hespen", "Spiridonvan Veldhoven", "ChristianPrins", "Ton Gvan Leeuwen", "WiendeltSteenbergen", "SrirangManohar"], "doi": "10.1118/1.4792462"}

{"title": "Endostatin inhibits hypertrophic scarring in a rabbit ear model.", "abstract": "The present study was designed to use an in vivo rabbit ear scar model to investigate the efficacy of systemic administration of endostatin in inhibiting scar formation.\nEight male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to two groups. Scar model was established by making six full skin defect wounds in each ear. For the intervention group, intraperitoneal injection of endostatin was performed each day after the wound healed (about 15 d post wounding). For the control group, equal volume of saline was injected. Thickness of scars in each group was measured by sliding caliper and the scar microcirculatory perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry on Days 15, 21, 28, and 35 post wounding. Rabbits were euthanatized and their scars were harvested for histological and proteomic analyses on Day 35 post wounding.\nMacroscopically, scars of the control group were thicker than those of the intervention group. Significant differences between the two groups were observed on Days 21 and 35 (p<0.05). Scar thickness, measured by scar elevation index (SEI) at Day 35 post wounding, was significantly reduced in the intervention group (1.09\u00b10.19) compared with the controls (1.36\u00b10.28). Microvessel density (MVD) observed in the intervention group (1.73\u00b10.94) was significantly lower than that of the control group (5.63\u00b11.78) on Day 35. The distribution of collagen fibers in scars treated with endostatin was relatively regular, while collagen fibers in untreated controls were thicker and showed disordered alignment. Western blot analysis showed that the expressions of type I collagen and Bcl-2 were depressed by injection of endostatin.\nOur results from the rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model indicate that systemic application of endostatin could inhibit local hypertrophic scar formation, possibly through reducing scar vascularization and angiogenesis.

Rambouillet ewe lambs (n = 82, approximately 240 d of age; 52 \u00b1 0.8 kg BW at breeding) were allocated to a 2 \u00d7 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments included dietary Se [adequate Se (ASe, 9.5 \u00b5g/kg BW) or high Se (HSe, 81.8 \u00b5g/kg BW)] initiated at breeding and nutritional plane [60% (restricted, RES), 100% (control, CON), and 140% (high, HI) of requirements] initiated at d 50 of gestation. Ewes were fed pelleted diets and housed individually indoors. At parturition, lambs were immediately removed and fed artificial colostrum for the first 20 h followed by ad libitum access to milk replacer. At 180 \u00b1 2 d of age, lambs were euthanized and tissues were harvested. Birth weight was affected by nutritional treatments (P < 0.001), with decreased birth weight in RES and HI compared with CON. Offspring from RES and HI ewes had decreased (P = 0.07) blood volume compared with CON, and those born to HSe ewes had increased (P < 0.04) total visceral adiposity. Within offspring from CON ewes, those from HSe ewes had greater (P < 0.02) intestinal mass compared with ASe ewes. Within offspring from HSe ewes, both RES and HI had reduced (P \u2264 0.05) intestinal mass compared with CON. Jejunal capillary area density was greater (P = 0.08) in offspring from ewes fed HSe compared with ASe. In addition, area per capillary was greater (P \u2264 0.09) in CON compared with RES. Maternal nutritional plane tended (P \u2264 0.11) to alter total small intestinal vascularity, with lambs from CON being greater than RES. Expression of most mRNA for measured angiogenic factors and receptors was not altered (P \u2264 0.13) by maternal treatments; however, expression of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) was decreased (P = 0.07) in offspring from RES compared with CON ewes. Offspring from ewes fed HI diets had increased (P = 0.08) jejunal mucosal maltase activity. In conclusion, maternal Se supply and nutritional plane during gestation resulted in measurable changes in offspring visceral tissues and intestinal biology, including perirenal fat, blood volume, intestinal mass, total jejunal crypt cell proliferation, area per capillary in jejunal villi, GLP-2 mRNA expression, and maltase activity at 180 d.

Traditionally, local muscles have been used for the proximal lower extremity and free flaps for the distal leg and foot, but perforator flaps over the past decade have been shown to be a reliable alternative.\nThe evolution of our lower limb flap selection for the period 1996 to 2000 was retrospectively compared with our current approach using perforator flaps. Flap selection was never random, but based according to wound location, severity, and flap availability.\nIn the preperforator flap era, 101 of 122 (82.8%) flaps were muscle flaps. Over the last 5 years, this relative usage decreased to 36.4%, whereas perforator flaps were chosen almost half the time (49.6%). Local flaps still predominated as the choice for the proximal lower limb, and free flaps more distally, with perforator free flaps chosen twice as often as muscle flaps. Major complications occurred most commonly in the more distal lower extremity and were related to microsurgical catastrophes and not flap subtype.\nPerforator flaps can be another soft tissue choice for all zones of the lower extremity, recognizing that function preservation is their major asset as no muscle need be included.

Stacks of sheet-like scaffold can be engineered to become artificial ECMs, suggesting a great potential for achieving complex 3-D tissue regeneration to support cell survival and growth. In this study, we proposed and investigated a combined particulate leaching of magnetic sugar particles (MSPs) and salt particles for the development of a sheet-like scaffold. MSPs were fabricated by encapsulating NdFeB particles inside sugar spheres and were controlled using magnetic fields as a porogen to control pore size, pore structure and pore density while fabricating the scaffold. We studied the influence of the strength of the magnetic fields in controlling the coating thickness of the unmagnetized MSPs during the fabrication of the sheet-like scaffolds. The experimental relationship between magnetic flux density and the thickness of the MSP layer was illustrated. Furthermore, we investigated the infiltration capacity of different concentrations of poly(L-lactide-co-\u025b-caprolactone) (PLCL) as a scaffold material on MSP clusters.

For the past decade, the Mount Sinai group in New York has intensively studied the anatomy of the extensive vascular network surrounding the spinal cord, as well as its dynamic morphology in response to decreased blood pressure and flow. Along with clinical data, experimental findings gave rise to the Collateral Network Concept, by which spinal cord injury in open TAAA repair can be significantly reduced. With the more recent widespread use of endovascular repair, strategies to prevent ischaemic spinal cord damage after extensive segmental artery sacrifice/occlusion are still evolving. The hypothesis that dividing extensive aneurysm repair into two steps may mitigate the impact of diminished blood flow to the collateral network has led to a recently conducted series of staged repair experiments. By exploiting the resources of the collateral network, spinal cord injury could be minimised in staged open, as well as in staged hybrid repair and seems equally adoptable for endovascular procedures.

The dispensing rheology is studied, and effects of material properties on structural formation of hollow filaments are analyzed.

The sagittal split was performed in the remaining right mandible and on the left side in the iliac crest cortico-cancellous autograft. Ten months later, oral rehabilitation was completed with implant placement in the neomandible. Follow-up showed a Class I occlusion, with good function. The patient was very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results. This case shows that a BSSO can be performed in a reconstructed mandible, without side effects and with good functional and aesthetic results.", "journal": "International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery", "date": "2013-03-05", "authors": ["GMensink", "J PVerweij", "P J JGooris", "J P Rvan Merkesteyn"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijom.2013.01.019"}

None, saline, standard-dose (5000Ukg(-1)) and high-dose (10,000Ukg(-1)) of human recombinant erythropoietin alpha were administered intraperitoneally in Wistar rats with myocardial infarction induced by coronary artery ligation. Infarct sizes measured after triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, levels of biochemical markers, histopathology examined by light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical expressions of erythropoietin, erythropoietin receptor, hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 and caspase-3, were analyzed. Lower scores of infarction and hemorrhage, lower number of macrophages and higher score of vascularization surrounding the infarct area were observed in the erythropoietin administered groups (p<0.05). Erythropoietin administration after myocardial infarction reduced the area of infarction and hemorrhage. There were hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 and caspase-3 expressions in the marginal area, and erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor expression in both marginal and normal areas (p<0.001). Vascularization, erythropoietin expression in the normal area and vascular erythropoietin expression were positively correlated with human erythropoietin levels. The cardioprotective effects of erythropoietin treatment were independent of endogenous erythropoietin/erythropoietin receptor activity. Moreover exogenous erythropoietin treatment did not suppress endogenous erythropoietin. Erythropoietin administration after myocardial infarction reduced caspase 3 expression (apoptotic activity) and induced neovascularization around the infarct area. Higher erythropoietin administration did not provide an additional benefit over the standard-dose in myocardial protection.", "journal": "Acta histochemica", "date": "2013-03-05", "authors": ["AyselGuven Bagla", "ErtugrulErcan", "Halil FatihAsgun", "MeltemIckin", "FerihaErcan", "OzlemYavuz", "SuatBagla", "AskinKaplan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acthis.2013.01.005"}

However the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying such phenomenon are not yet completely elucidated. In this article the author provides a general scheme to explain the causal relation between osteoporosis and delayed intervertebral disc degeneration by two main pathophysiological pathways: a vascular and a mechanical one. According to such model, osteoporosis positively affects disc nutrient diffusion through several mechanisms such as: increased endplate vascularization, decreased endplate resistance and decreased intradiscal strain. In the sequence a comprehensive review of the current literature on the issue is performed in order to provide a general overview about the current degree of evidence about the role of each factor postulated to be involved in such pathophysiological scheme. Finally the author provides overall directions for future research on the issue with special attention to the causal links which are supported by weak scientific evidence or by evidence from single studies.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2013-03-05", "authors": ["Tobias AMattei"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2013.01.030"}

{"title": "Nicotinamide inhibits vasculogenic mimicry, an alternative vascularization pathway observed in highly aggressive melanoma.", "abstract": "Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) describes functional vascular channels composed only of tumor cells and its presence predicts poor prognosis in melanoma patients. Inhibition of this alternative vascularization pathway might be of clinical importance, especially as several anti-angiogenic therapies targeting endothelial cells are largely ineffective in melanoma. We show the presence of VM structures histologically in a series of human melanoma lesions and demonstrate that cell cultures derived from these lesions form tubes in 3D cultures ex vivo. We tested the ability of nicotinamide, the amide form of vitamin B3 (niacin), which acts as an epigenetic gene regulator through unique cellular pathways, to modify VM. Nicotinamide effectively inhibited the formation of VM structures and destroyed already formed ones, in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, VM formation capacity remained suppressed even one month after the complete withdrawal of Nicotimamid. The inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on VM formation could be at least partially explained by a nicotinamide-driven downregulation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-Cadherin), which is known to have a central role in VM. Further major changes in the expression profile of hundreds of genes, most of them clustered in biologically-relevant clusters, were observed. In addition, nicotinamide significantly inhibited melanoma cell proliferation, but had an opposite effect on their invasion capacity. Cell cycle analysis indicated moderate changes in apoptotic indices. Therefore, nicotinamide could be further used to unravel new biological mechanisms that drive VM and tumor progression. Targeting VM, especially in combination with anti-angiogenic strategies, is expected to be synergistic and might yield substantial anti neoplastic effects in a variety of malignancies.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-03-02", "authors": ["OritItzhaki", "EyalGreenberg", "BruriaShalmon", "AdvaKubi", "Avraham JTreves", "RonnieShapira-Frommer", "CamillaAvivi", "RonaOrtenberg", "EytanBen-Ami", "JacobSchachter", "Michal JBesser", "GalMarkel"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0057160"}

This bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, here designated the corpus cavernosum maxillaris, runs along the center of the hard palate, expanding cranially to form two large lobes that terminate under the tip of the rostral palate, with another enlarged node at the caudal terminus. Gross anatomical and microscopic observation of tissue sections discloses a web-like internal mass with a large blood volume. Histological examination reveals large numbers of blood vessels and vascular as well as extravascular spaces resembling a blood-filled, erectile sponge. These spaces, as well as accompanying blood vessels, extend to the base of the epithelium. We contend that this organ provides a thermoregulatory adaptation by which bowhead whales (1) control heat loss by transferring internal, metabolically generated body heat to cold seawater and (2) protect the brain from hyperthermia. We postulate that this organ may play additional roles in baleen growth and in detecting prey, and that its ability to dissipate heat might maintain proper operating temperature for palatal mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors to detect the presence and density of intraoral prey.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2013-03-02", "authors": ["Thomas JFord", "Alexander JWerth", "J CraigGeorge"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.22681"}

A cell type derived from the subamnion, namely, cord-lining mesenchymal stem cells (CL-MSC), has recently been identified. Here we present a restorative strategy that combines a fibrin graft containing human CL-MSC and omental flap providing, thereby, cell-, structural-, and angiogenic support to the injured myocardium. The graft consisted of a mixture of 2\u00d710(6) CL-MSC-GFP-Fluc and fibrin. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in nude rats and following confirmation of ensued heart failure with echocardiography 2 weeks after injury, therapeutic intervention was performed as follows: untreated (MI, n=7), CL-MSC graft (CL-MSCG, n=8), CL-MSCG and omental flap (CL-MSCG+OM, n=11), and omental flap (OM, n=8). In vivo bioluminescence imaging at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-treatment indicated comparable early donor cell viability between the CL-MSCG and CL-MSCG+OM. Treatment with CL-MSCG+OM improved the myocardial function as assessed by the measurement of end-diastolic left ventricular (LV) pressure (3.53\u00b10.34 vs. 5.21\u00b10.54\u2009mmHg, p<0.05), contractility (+dP/dt, 3383.8\u00b1250.78\u2009mmHg vs. 2464.9\u00b1191.8\u2009mmHg, p<0.05), and the relaxation rate (-dP/dt, -2707.2\u00b1250.7\u2009mmHg vs. 1948.7\u00b1207.8\u2009mmHg, p<0.05), compared to MI control 6 weeks after ischemic injury. Furthermore, evidence of a 20.32% increase in the ejection fraction was observed in CL-MSCG+OM rats from week 2 to 6 after injury. Both CL-MSCG and CL-MSCG+OM led to an enhanced cardiac output (p<0.05), and attenuated the infarct size (35.7%\u00b14.2% and 34.7%\u00b14.8%), as compared to MI (60.7%\u00b13.1%; p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). All treated groups had a higher arteriole density than controls. Yet, a higher amount of functional blood vessels, and a 20-fold increase in arteriole numbers were found in CL-MSCG+OM. Altogether, CL-MSCGs supplemented with vascular supply have the potential to repair the failing, chronically ischemic heart by improving myocardial revascularization, attenuating remodeling, and ameliorating cardiac dysfunction.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

All patients received 3 consecutive monthly injections of 0.5 mg/0.05 mL of ranibizumab as induction treatment. Retreatment was allowed if evidence of clinical deterioration was noted or spectral domain optical coherence tomography at the 1-month follow-up showed intraretinal edema, subretinal fluid, or recurrent PED. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) values measured before and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the first injection were compared according to the type of PED. Changes in the height of PED to treatment with IVR were also investigated.\nFifty-six eyes were assessed at the 12-month follow-up examination. There were 4 types of PED, including serous PED in 11 patients (19.6%), fibrovascular PED in 28 patients (50.0%), mixed PED with serous and fibrovascular component in 7 patients (12.5%), and hemorrhagic PED in 10 patients (17.9%). Eyes with serous PED showed significant improvement of the mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) BCVA as compared with the value at the baseline, which was sustained throughout the 12-month period (P < 0.05). Regarding the eyes with fibrovascular and mixed PED, significant improvement of the mean logMAR BCVA was observed compared with the value at the baseline at 3 months; however, a slight decrease was observed at 6 and 12 months. In the eyes with hemorrhagic PED, no significant difference in the mean BCVA values compared with the value at the baseline was observed at any follow-up time point. In relation to the height of the PED, all eyes in the serous and mixed PED group, 17 eyes in the fibrovascular PED group (60.7%), and 9 eyes in the hemorrhagic PED group (90.0%) showed reduction of the maximum PED height by 100 \u03bcm or more. The PED response to IVR was not correlated with the final BCVA.\nIntravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration is effective for stabilizing vision in patients with PED, but it may be better tolerated in patients with serous PED.

An oval flap 1.5\u00a0cm large was raised along the axis between these two points. Perforators going into the flap were dissected up to their origin from the ulnar palmar digital artery of the little finger, and their distance from the proximal edge of the A1 pulley was recorded.\nThe mean number of perforator arteries entering the flap was 5.8 (range 4-8). A constant sizeable perforator was identified within 0.7\u00a0cm from the proximal margin of the A1 pulley in all 14 specimens. In the majority of cases (64\u00a0%), the most distal perforator was located at this level. Dissection of the flap was carried out suprafascially on the most distal perforator and 180\u00b0 rotation allowed the flap to reach the flexor surface of the fifth finger. The donor site was closed primarily.\nDistal perforators of the ulnar palmar digital artery of the little finger are constantly found. Our anatomical findings support the possibility of raising a propeller perforator flap from the hypothenar region for coverage of the flexor aspect of the little finger.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed using Gd-EOB-DTPA (0.025 mmol Gd/kg; 0.1 mL/kg body weight) as the contrast agent. The percentages of relative enhancement were calculated at each time point after Gd-EOB-DTPA injection. In addition, relative enhancement maps were generated through pixel-by-pixel calculations before the injection and at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes after the injection. After the DCE-MRI study, blood was sampled from all rats and 6 blood sample parameters, serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and total bile acids, were measured. Rat livers were processed for histologic diagnosis to clarify contrast agent uptake/efflux by examining Oatp1, Mrp2, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule immunohistochemical staining.\nThe relative enhancement of the Mrp2-deficient, Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rats (EHBRs) (48.6% [3.4%]) was significantly lower than that of the control rats (64.0% [3.2%]; P < 0.001) 5 minutes after the Gd-EOB-DTPA injection. Thereafter, the relative enhancement observed in the EHBRs (10 minutes, 59.6% [5.4%]; 20 minutes, 67.8% [4.1%]; 30 minutes, 69.1% [4.2%]; 40 minutes, 71.0% [4.2%]; P < 0.0001) was significantly higher than that in the control rats at the same time points after the Gd-EOB-DTPA injection. The aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase values were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and total bile acids levels in EHBRs were significantly higher than those in the control rats. The percentages of the Mrp2-positive cells in the control rats were higher compared with the EHBRs (control, 0.3% [0.1%]; EHBR, 14.1% [3.6%]; P < 0.01). However, the percentages of the Oatp1-positive cells were not different between the 2 groups. Moreover, the percentages of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-positive cells in the blood vessels of the control rat livers were higher compared with the EHBRs (control, 17.5% [3.3%]; EHBR, 9.5% [3.9%]; P < 0.01).\nThe utility of noninvasive DCE-MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA as a tool for the assessment of Mrp2-deficient hyperbilirubinuria rats was demonstrated. We also clarified that the lower vascular density in the EHBRs may cause delayed uptake of the contrast agent compared with the control rats.

Implantation of growth factor-loaded alginate constructs typically shows an increase in capillary density but without vascular stabilization. Delivery of multiple factors may improve these outcomes. Cell delivery approaches focus on stimulating vascularization either via cell release of soluble factors, cell proliferation and incorporation into new vessels or alginate prevascularization prior to implantation.

The preoperative knowledge of the venous vascularization of the temporal area is critical for microsurgical reconstruction, such as temporoparietal fascia free flap, and especially in understanding the anatomy of the veins for flap survival. Therefore, we conducted an anatomic study to confirm the classification of Legre et al. and a radiologic study to examine the venous network of the temporal area. We found three frequent patterns of the temporal venous network: (1) Type I (the most common), with a predominant temporal vein; (2) Type II, with a predominant posterior auricular vein; (3) Type III, when both veins were equally important. Because of this great variability, the use of a temporal flap for reconstruction of the head and neck should be restricted, and the examination of venous vascularization appears to be necessary before surgery.

The aim of this study was to evaluate transthoracic ultrasound-mediated microbubble stimulation (UMS) as a novel gene- and cell-free therapeutic option after acute myocardial infarction and reperfusion (AMI/R) in mice.\nFor myocardial delivery of UMS, a novel therapeutic ultrasound-system (TIPS, Philips Medical) and commercially available microbubbles (BR1, Bracco Suisse SA) were utilized in a closed-chest mouse model. UMS was performed as myocardial post-conditioning (PC) on day four after 30 minutes of coronary occlusion and reperfusion. LV-morphology, as well as global and regional function were measured repeatedly with reconstructive 3-dimensional echocardiography applying an additional low-dose dobutamine protocol after two weeks.

We construct a combined strategy of ECs coating in the presence of nutritious and immune factors supplied by SCs in a co-culture system to investigate the effect of vascularization and rejection inhibition for islet graft. In vivo, the combined strategy improved the survival and vascularization as well as inhibited lymphocytes and inflammatory cytokines. In vitro, we found the combinatorial strategy improved the function of islets and the effect of ECs-coating on islets. Combined strategy treated islets revealed higher levels of anti-apoptotic signal molecules (Bcl-2 and HSP-32), survival and function related molecules (PDX-1, Ki-67, ERK1/2 and Akt) and demonstrated increased vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR) and angiogenesis signal molecules (FAk and PLC-\u03b3). SCs effectively inhibited the activation of lymphocyte stimulated by islets and ECs. Predominantly immunosuppressive cytokines could be detected in culture supernatants of the SCs coculture group.

{"title": "Human endothelial colony-forming cells expanded with an improved protocol are a useful endothelial cell source for scaffold-based tissue engineering.", "abstract": "One of the major challenges in tissue engineering is to supply larger three-dimensional (3D) bioengineered tissue transplants with sufficient amounts of nutrients and oxygen and to allow metabolite removal. Consequently, artificial vascularization strategies of such transplants are desired. One strategy focuses on endothelial cells capable of initiating new vessel formation, which are settled on scaffolds commonly used in tissue engineering. A bottleneck in this strategy is to obtain sufficient amounts of endothelial cells, as they can be harvested only in small quantities directly from human tissues. Thus, protocols are required to expand appropriate cells in sufficient amounts without interfering with their capability to settle on scaffold materials and to initiate vessel formation. Here, we analysed whether umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) fulfil these requirements. In a first set of experiments, we showed that marginally expanded ECFCs settle and survive on different scaffold biomaterials. Next, we improved ECFC culture conditions and developed a protocol for ECFC expansion compatible with 'Good Manufacturing Practice' (GMP) standards. We replaced animal sera with human platelet lysates and used a novel type of tissue-culture ware. ECFCs cultured under the new conditions revealed significantly lower apoptosis and increased proliferation rates. Simultaneously, their viability was increased. Since extensively expanded ECFCs could still settle on scaffold biomaterials and were able to form tubular structures in Matrigel assays, we conclude that these ex vivo-expanded ECFCs are a novel, very potent cell source for scaffold-based tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2013-02-26", "authors": ["BerndDenecke", "Liska DHorsch", "StefanRadtke", "Johannes CFischer", "Peter AHorn", "BerndGiebel"], "doi": "10.1002/term.1673"}

{"title": "Alzheimer's disease: the downside of a highly evolved parietal lobe?", "abstract": "Clinical grade Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only described in humans. Recent imaging studies in early AD patients showed that the parietal areas display the most prominent metabolic impairments. So far, neuroimaging studies have not been able to explain why the medial parietal regions possess this hub characteristic in AD. Paleoneurological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that our species, Homo sapiens, has a unique and derived organization of the parietal areas, which are involved in higher cognitive functions. Combining evidence from neuroimaging, paleontology, and comparative anatomy, we suggest that the vulnerability of the parietal lobe to neurodegenerative processes may be associated with the origin of our species. The species-specific parietal morphology in modern humans largely influenced the brain spatial organization, and it involved changes in vascularization and energy management, which may underlie the sensitivity of these areas to metabolic impairment. Metabolic constraints and anatomical evolutionary changes in the medial parietal regions of modern humans may be important in early AD onset. Taking into account the species-specific adaptations of the modern human parietal areas and their association with AD, we hypothesize that AD can be the evolutionary drawback of the specialized structure of our parietal lobes. The cognitive advantage is associated with increased sensitivity to neurodegenerative processes which, being limited to the post-reproductive period, have a minor effect on the overall genetic fitness. The changes of energy requirements associated with form and size variations at the parietal areas may support the hypothesis of AD as a metabolic syndrome.", "journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "date": "2013-02-26", "authors": ["EmilianoBruner", "Heidi I LJacobs"], "doi": "10.3233/JAD-122299"}

We explored the sorafenib treatment escape mechanisms to overcome their drawbacks.\nImmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the mTOR pathway [mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)]. Cell viability, colony growth, and cell migration were evaluated in different osteosarcoma cell lines (MNNG-HOS, HOS, KHOS/NP, MG63, U-2OS, SJSA-1, and SAOS-2) after scalar dose treatment with sorafenib (10-0.625 \u03bcmol/L), rapamycin-analog everolimus (100-6.25 nmol/L), and combinations of the two. Cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice injected with MNNG-HOS cells were used to determine antitumor and antimetastatic effects. Angiogenesis and vascularization were evaluated in vitro by exploiting endothelial branching morphogenesis assays and in vivo in xenografted mice and chorioallantoic membranes.\nAfter sorafenib treatment, mTORC1 signaling was reduced (downstream target P-S6), whereas mTORC2 was increased (phospho-mTOR Ser2481) in MNNG-HOS xenografts compared with vehicle-treated mice. Combining sorafenib with everolimus resulted in complete abrogation of both mTORC1 [through ROS-mediated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation] and mTORC2 (through complex disassembly).

{"title": "Animal models for anti-angiogenic therapy in endometriosis.", "abstract": "Endometriosis is a gynecological disease characterized by the growth of endometrium outside of the uterine cavity. It is often associated with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain and infertility. One of the key requirements for endometriotic lesions to survive is development of a blood supply to support their growth. Indeed, dense vascularization is characteristic feature of endometriotic lesions. This has led to the idea that suppression of blood vessel growth (anti-angiogenic therapy) may be a successful therapeutic approach for endometriosis. Potential effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies has been assessed in some animal models but there are no reports of human clinical trials. Without understanding the specific mechanism by which endometriosis lesions establish a new blood supply, short-term animal experiments will have limited value for translation into human medicine. Further, it is crucial to use appropriate animal models to assess efficacy of anti-angiogenic compounds. Syngeneic and autologous rodent models, where endometrial fragments are auto-transplanted into the peritoneal cavity are commonly used in anti-angiogenic therapy studies. Another approach is xenograft models where human endometrium is engrafted into immunodeficient mice.

Although surgical intervention in the form of enterocystoplasty is the current standard of care in which to remedy the neurogenic bladder, it is still a stop-gap measure and is associated with many complications due to the use of bowel as a source of replacement tissue. Contemporary bladder tissue engineering strategies lack the ability to reform bladder smooth muscle, vasculature, and promote peripheral nerve tissue growth when using autologous populations of cells. Within the context of this study, we demonstrate the role of two specific populations of bone marrow (BM) stem/progenitor cells used in combination with a synthetic elastomeric scaffold that provides a unique and alternative means to current bladder regeneration approaches. In vitro differentiation, gene expression, and proliferation are similar among donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whereas poly(1,8-octanediol-cocitrate) scaffolds seeded with SB BM MSCs perform analogously to control counterparts with regard to bladder smooth muscle wall formation in vivo.

{"title": "Predictive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of tumor growth after administration of an anti-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, as single-agent and combination therapy in tumor xenografts.", "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models able to predict the action of anticancer compounds in tumor xenografts have an important impact on drug development. In case of anti-angiogenic compounds, many of the available models show difficulties in their applications, as they are based on a cell kill hypothesis, while these drugs act on the tumor vascularization, without a direct tumor cell kill effect. For this reason, a PK-PD model able to describe the tumor growth modulation following treatment with a cytostatic therapy, as opposed to a cytotoxic treatment, is proposed here.\nUntreated tumor growth was described using an exponential growth phase followed by a linear one. The effect of anti-angiogenic compounds was implemented using an inhibitory effect on the growth function. The model was tested on a number of experiments in tumor-bearing mice given the anti-angiogenic drug bevacizumab either alone or in combination with another investigational compound. Nonlinear regression techniques were used for estimating the model parameters.\nThe model successfully captured the tumor growth data following different bevacizumab dosing regimens, allowing to estimate experiment-independent parameters. A combination model was also developed under a 'no-interaction' assumption to assess the effect of the combination of bevacizumab with a target-oriented agent. The observation of a significant difference between model-predicted and observed tumor growth curves was suggestive of the presence of a pharmacological interaction that was further accommodated into the model.\nThis approach can be used for optimizing the design of preclinical experiments. With all the inherent limitations, the estimated experiment-independent model parameters can be used to provide useful indications for the single-agent and combination regimens to be explored in the subsequent development phases.", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2013-02-23", "authors": ["MaurizioRocchetti", "MassimilianoGermani", "FrancescaDel Bene", "ItaloPoggesi", "PaoloMagni", "EnricoPesenti", "GiuseppeDe Nicolao"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-013-2107-z"}

It is well known that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), found in abundance in adipose tissue, have the same differentiating capacity as mesenchymal stem cells yet have the advantage of being easily isolated. In the present study, we combined the great facility of ADSCs to differentiate with the application of an external mechanical stimulus to successfully create an in vitro reconstructed tendonlike structure with a microcapillary network.\nHyalonect meshes (Fidia Advanced Biopolymers, Abano Terme, Padova, Italy) were used as scaffold. Human ADSCs were seeded onto the biomaterials, and the cell/scaffold constructs were cultured under mechanical stress for up to 15 days. Human tenocytes were used in the same conditions as control. Performance was assessed by histology, immunochemistry, ultrastructure, and biomolecular analysis.\nAdipose-derived stem cells seeded onto Hyalonect adhered and differentiated along the entire surface of the biomaterial and began to infiltrate within its structure. Subsequently, endothelial cells migrated, forming a capillary in the new extracellular matrix.\nThis technique allowed for the creation of a vascularized tendon equivalent that could easily be detached from the bioreactor, thus facilitating its implant at the lesion site.

Resveratrol is a pleiotropic agent, which dose-dependently suppresses the development of new blood vessels.\nThis was a randomized study in a mouse model of endometriosis. Twenty female BALB/c mice with surgically induced endometriosis were treated with resveratrol (40 mg/kg/day, n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10) for 4 weeks.\nPeritoneal and mesenteric endometriotic lesions were surgically induced by uterine tissue transplantation into the abdominal cavity of BALB/c mice. The animals were daily treated with resveratrol (40 mg/kg) or vehicle by oral gavage. Lesion growth, vascularization, apoptosis and cell proliferation were subsequently analyzed by means of high-resolution ultrasound imaging, caliper measurements, histology and immunohistochemistry throughout an observation period of 4 weeks.\nResveratrol inhibited angiogenesis in peritoneal and mesenteric endometriotic lesions, as indicated by a significantly reduced microvessel density when compared with controls. Additional immunohistochemical analyses revealed that this was caused by a decreased proliferating activity of CD31-positive endothelial cells in the newly developing microvasculature of the lesions. In line with these findings, lesions in resveratrol-treated mice exhibited a reduced growth rate and a smaller final size than controls. This was associated with lower numbers of proliferating cell nuclear antigen- and Ki67-positive stromal and glandular cells. Apoptotic cells were not detectable in either group. To limit the role of chance, the experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with appropriate controls. Statistical significance was accepted for a value of P < 0.05.\nEndometriotic lesions were surgically induced by uterine tissue transplantation without the use of pathological endometriotic tissue of human origin. Therefore, the results obtained in this mouse model may not fully correlate to human patients with endometriosis.\nResveratrol is a potent inhibitor of vascularization in endometriotic lesions. This, most probably, causes the suppression of lesion growth.

The obtained sequence reads were mapped to the porcine genome, and relative expression values were calculated for the analysis of differential gene expression.

Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The RNA-Seq data were compared to results of a microarray study of bovine endometrium on Day 18 of pregnancy and additional related data sets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the genes with higher mRNA concentration in pregnant samples strong overrepresentation, particularly for immune-related functional terms but also for apoptosis and cell adhesion. Overrepresented terms for the genes with lower mRNA concentration in pregnant samples were related to extracellular region, ion transport, cell adhesion, and lipid and steroid metabolic process.

Despite the technical refinement over the past 3 decades, the resulting active motion of the reconstructed joint remains unpredictable and often fraught with extension lag. The technique for vascularized toe PIPJ transfer at our institute has evolved over the years to its current state, with simultaneous extensor mechanism reconstruction being a major component. During the transfer, the quality of extensor tendons on the recipient finger and donor toe are carefully evaluated. If the central slip of finger extensor is destroyed but the quality of lateral bands is adequate, centralization of lateral bands overlying the transferred PIPJ is performed. If there is acceptable central slip remnant at the proximal phalanx level, modified Stack procedure is performed for central slip reconstruction while leaving the lateral bands in continuity. If both lateral bands are poor, modified Stack procedure is performed unless the central tendon of the toe is strong enough to extend the PIPJ. From November 2008 to October 2010, 7 joints were transferred with this modified technique. The average follow-up was 18.2 months. The average active AOM of the transferred PIPJ was 56.4 degrees. The average extension lag of the toe PIPJ was 10.7 and 16.4 degrees before and after the transfer, respectively.

We report on two additional examples of an analogous phenomenon encountered in male patients, aged 59 years (Case 1) and 91 years (Case 2). Both tumors were intra- and suprasellar masses, measuring 5.6 cm \u00d7 4.4 cm \u00d7 3.4 cm, and 2.7 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 1.7 cm, respectively. Histologically, Case 1 was an FSH-cell adenoma interwoven by vascularized connective tissue septa that tended to exhibit incremental stages of adventitial overgrowth. The epithelial component of Case 2 corresponded to an LH-cell adenoma, and lay partitioned by a maze of paucicellular to hyalinized vascular axes. Irrespective of architectural variations, perivascular spindle cells exhibited immunopositivity for vimentin, muscular actin, and smooth muscle actin. Conversely, negative results were obtained for CD34, EMA, S100 protein, GFAP, and TTF-1. Ultrastructural study failed to reveal metaplastic cell forms involving transitional features between adenohypophyseal-epithelial and mesenchymal-contractile phenotype. We propose that LANT be regarded as a peculiar reflection of maladaptive angiogenesis in some pituitary adenomas, rather than a genuine hybrid neoplasm. While no mechanistic clue is forthcoming to account for this distinctive pattern, hemodynamic strain through direct arterial - rather than portal - supply of the adenoma's capillary bed may be one such explanatory factor.

We have used the transgenic mouse model mWt1/IRES/GFP-Cre (Wt1(cre)) crossed with the Rosa26R-EYFP reporter mouse. In the gastrointestinal duct Wt1, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, is specific and dynamically expressed in the coelomic epithelium. In the embryos obtained from the crossbreeding, the Wt1-expressing cell lineage produces the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) allowing for colocalization with differentiation markers through confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Wt1(cre-YFP) cells were very abundant throughout the intestine during midgestation, declining in neonates. Wt1(cre-YFP) cells were also transiently observed within the mucosa, being apparently released into the intestinal lumen. YFP was detected in cells contributing to intestinal vascularization (endothelium, pericytes and smooth muscle), visceral musculature (circular, longitudinal and submucosal) as well as in Cajal and Cajal-like interstitial cells. Wt1(cre-YFP) mesenchymal cells expressed FGF9, a critical growth factor for intestinal development, as well as PDGFR\u03b1, mainly within developing villi. Thus, a cell population derived from the coelomic epithelium incorporates to the gut mesenchyme and contribute to a variety of intestinal tissues, probably playing also a signaling role.

Natural products, derived from both plants and animals, provide a significant haven of compounds which have proved to be of great benefit to man and his ailments. Whilst significant advances have been made in the understanding of impaired angiogenesis in a non-healing wound, in the clinical setting, few effective agents exist that can expedite wound healing and closure.

In this review, we collate new evidence that details the potential for several natural compounds to promote angiogenesis and wound healing, most predominately via the up regulation of VEGF expression, that warrant urgent further investigation for development into new pro-angiogenic/wound healing therapies.", "journal": "Angiogenesis", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["ClaireMorgan", "YamniNigam"], "doi": "10.1007/s10456-013-9341-1"}
{"title": "Pedicled vascularized fibular graft with Ilizarov external fixator for reconstructing a large bone defect of the tibia after tumor resection.", "abstract": "Large bony defects in the middle or distal third of the tibia resulting from surgical resection of malignant bone tumors present a difficult reconstructive challenge. Various methods of reconstruction are available, such as allografts, vascularized fibular graft (either free or pedicled), or endoprothesis replacement for distal defects.\nTwelve patients--eight males and four females with mean age of 18 years at operation (range 14-25 years)--with malignant bone tumors of the tibial shaft were selected as candidates for wide resection of the tumor and reconstruction of the bony defect by ipsilateral vascularized fibular graft based on the peroneal vessels. Preoperative staging studies, including plain radiography, local MRI, isotopic bone scan, and chest CT, were done for every patient before biopsy. Ilizarov external fixation was then applied in all cases. The average length of the bony gap bridged was 14.5 cm (13-16.5 cm) and the mean length of the harvested graft was 16.3 cm (15-18 cm). The average operation time was 7.5 h (5.5-9.5 h).\nThe mean follow-up period was 38 months (range 32-52 months). Bony union at the proximal and distal ends of the fibula occurred in nine patients (75 %) and at a mean time of 5.5 months (range 4.5-8 months). Graft hypertrophy occurred in all patients. The mean percentage of hypertrophy was 95 % (range 80-160 %). The mean MSTS functional score was 84 % (range 80-92 %). A leg length discrepancy of 2 cm was reported in two patients and was managed using a shoe lift.\nReconstruction of bony defects of the middle or distal tibia after bone tumor resection using pedicled vascularized fibula is a useful limb salvage procedure. The procedure can be performed relatively quickly and inexpensively and has a low rate of late complications. It leads to a good outcome regarding the union, hypertrophy, and function.", "journal": "Journal of orthopaedics and traumatology : official journal of the Italian Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["Yousuf MKhira", "Hamed ABadawy"], "doi": "10.1007/s10195-013-0225-3\n10.1634/theoncologist.11-5-503\n10.1016/S1470-2045(05)01734-1\n10.1302/0301-620X.84B3.12019\n10.1200/JCO.2004.00.5785\n10.2106/JBJS.F.01324\n10.1016/S0959-8049(00)00028-9\n10.1016/S0007-1226(03)00186-3\n10.1097/00003086-199901000-00003\n10.1302/0301-620X.82B7.10332\n10.1097/01.PRS.0000122213.82011.C5\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B2.21272\n10.1002/micr.20384\n10.1097/01.blo.0000179586.34727.5b\n10.1097/00005373-199206000-00004\n10.1002/1098-2752(2000)20:5<233::AID-MICR4>3.0.CO;2-O\n10.3109/17453679708996706"}

In treatments aimed at gingival tissue regeneration, tissue engineering is preferred over the common treatments such as scaling. Perfused (dynamic) culture has been shown to increase cell growth in tissue-engineered scaffolds. Since gingival tissues are highly vascularized, it was desired to investigate the influence of perfusion on the function of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) when cultured in a degradable/polar/hydrophobic/ionic polyurethane scaffold during the early culture phase (4weeks) of engineering gingival tissues. It was observed that the growth of HGF was continuous over 28days in dynamic culture (3-fold increase, p<0.05), while it was reduced after 14days in static culture (i.e. no flow condition). Cell metabolic activity, as measured by a WST-1 assay, and total protein production show that HGF were in different metabolic states in the dynamic vs. static cultures. Observations from scanning electron microscopy and type I collagen (Col I) production measured by Western blotting suggest that medium perfusion significantly promoted collagen production in HGF after the first 4weeks of culture (p<0.05). The different proliferative and metabolic states for HGF in the perfused scaffolds suggest a different cell phenotype which may favour tissue regeneration.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["Jane W CCheung", "Emily ERose", "JPaul Santerre"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.02.010"}

Nanofiber scaffolds for local or systemic drug delivery through the oral mucosa, however, have not been fully explored. In this work, we fabricated electrospun gelatin nanofiber scaffolds for oral mucosal drug delivery. To improve structural stability of the electrospun gelatin scaffolds and allow non-invasive incorporation of therapeutics into the scaffold, we employed photo-reactive polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA575, 575 gmol(-1)) as a cross-linker to stabilize the scaffold by forming semi-interpenetrating network gelatin nanofiber scaffolds (sIPN NSs), during which cross-linker concentration was varied (1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7). The results showed that electrospun gelatin nanofiber scaffolds after being cross-linked with PEG-DA575 (i.e. sIPN NS1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7) retained fiber morphology and possessed improved structural stability. A series of structural parameters and properties of the cross-linked electrospun gelatin scaffolds were systematically characterized in terms of morphology, fiber diameter, mechanical properties, porosity, swelling and degradation. Mucin absorption onto sIPN NS4\u00d7 was also confirmed, indicating this scaffold possessed greatest mucoadhesion properties among those tested.

Accordingly, their incorporation into tissue constructs represents a promising vascularization strategy in tissue engineering. In the present study, we analyzed whether the efficacy of this approach can be improved by seeding adMSCs as three-dimensional spheroids onto porous scaffolds. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive adMSCs expressing CD13, CD73, CD90 and CD117 were isolated from C57BL/6-TgN(ACTB-EGFP)1Osb/J mice for the generation of spheroids using the liquid overlay technique. Porous polyurethane scaffolds were seeded with these spheroids or a comparable number of individual adMSCs and implanted into the dorsal skinfold chamber of C57BL/6 wild-type mice. The vascularization of the implants was analyzed and compared to non-seeded scaffolds by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The adMSC spheroids exhibited a homogeneous diameter of ~270\u03bcm and could easily be incorporated into the scaffolds by dynamic seeding. After implantation, they induced a strong angiogenic host tissue response, resulting in an improved scaffold vascularization with a significantly higher functional microvessel density when compared to non-seeded scaffolds and scaffolds seeded with individual adMSCs. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that a high fraction of ~40% of all microvessels within the center of spheroid-seeded scaffolds developed from GFP-positive adMSCs. These vessels inosculated with ingrowing GFP-negative vessels of the host. This indicates that adMSC spheroids serve as individual vascularization units, promoting the simultaneous development of new microvascular networks at different locations inside implanted tissue constructs. Thus, adMSC spheroids may be used to increase the efficacy of MSC-based vascularization strategies in future tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2013-02-19", "authors": ["M WLaschke", "T ESchank", "CScheuer", "SKleer", "SSchuler", "WMetzger", "DEglin", "MAlini", "M DMenger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2013.02.013"}

Histological sections of globes were used to count ESC and measure Bowman's layer.\nThe horizontal diameter of the globe was longer than the vertical diameter. The posterior sclera was thick, causing the internal axial length (and therefore the optical axis) to be shorter than the vertical diameter. The cornea was composed of an epithelium, Bowman's layer, collagenous stroma, thin Descemet's membrane and endothelial layer. Bowman's layer was present in all specimens except one Kogia breviceps. The thickness was variable, with the acellular layer thickest in Tursiops truncatus and thinnest in Kogia sp. The iris was well vascularized and muscled while the ciliary body lacked musculature, but retained vasculature.

A total of 193 established scaphoid nonunions were treated in our clinics between the years 1999 and 2004; of which, eight cases involved the distal pole of the scaphoid. These were further analyzed to determine factors that may have contributed to the development of nonunion. This study reveals that distal pole nonunions account for 4.1% of all scaphoid nonunions. We found inadequate initial treatment to be the cause for nonunion in 63% of patients. Type IIC fracture pattern according to Posser's classification was seen in 100% of patients and a persistent Dorsal Intercalated Segmental Instability (DISI) pattern in 100% patients. In addition, 100% of fractures occurred at the watershed zone between the two vascular networks of the scaphoid. We believe the key features leading to the likelihood of nonunion at the distal pole include a Type IIC fracture pattern associated with a continued deforming force that eventually leads to a DISI deformity.

{"title": "Visualization of intrapulmonary lymph vessels in healthy and inflamed murine lung using CD90/Thy-1 as a marker.", "abstract": "Lymphatic vessels play a pivotal role in fluid drainage and egress of immune cells from the lung. However, examining murine lung lymphatics is hampered by the expression of classical lymph endothelial markers on other cell types, which hinders the unambiguous identification of lymphatics. The expression of CD90/Thy-1 on lymph endothelium was recently described and we therefore examined its suitability to identify murine pulmonary lymph vessels under healthy and inflammatory conditions.\nImmunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against CD90.2/Thy-1.2 on 200 \u00b5m thick precision cut lung slices labeled a vascular network that was distinct from blood vessels. Preembedding immunostaining and electron microscopy verified that the anti-CD90.2/Thy-1.2 antibody labeled lymphatic endothelium. Absence of staining in CD90.1/Thy-1.1 expressing FVB mice indicated that CD90/Thy-1 was expressed on lymph endothelium and labeling was not due to antibody cross reactivity. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry for CD90/Thy-1 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin identified two routes for lymph vessel exit from the murine lung. One started in the parenchyma or around veins and left via venous blood vessels. The other began in the space around airways or in the space between airways and pulmonary arteries and left via the main bronchi. As expected from the pulmonary distribution of lymph vessels, intranasal application of house dust mite led to accumulation of T cells around veins and in the connective tissue between airways and pulmonary arteries. Surprisingly, increased numbers of T cells were also detected around intraacinar arteries that lack lymph vessels. This arterial T cell sheath extended to the pulmonary arteries where lymph vessels were located.\nThese results indicate that CD90/Thy-1 is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells and represents a suitable marker for murine lung lymph vessels.

Tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis are mediated, at least in part, through degradation of basement membrane by neutral matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) produced by tumor and stromal cells. Evidence suggests that MMP-9 plays a significant role in breast tumor cell invasion and metastasis. DNAzymes or catalytic oligonucleotides are new classes of gene targeting molecules that bind and cleave a specific mRNA, resulting in decreased protein expression.\nThe application of anti-MMP-9 DNAzyme (AM9D) for the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using MDA-MB-231 cells and the MMTV-PyMT transgenic breast cancer mouse model. Spontaneously developed mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice were treated intratumorally with naked AM9D, once a week for 4 weeks. The stability of DNAzyme was determined in vitro and in vivo using fluorescently labeled DNAzyme.\nAM9D specifically inhibited expression of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulting in reduced invasive property of these cells by 43%. Weekly intratumoral treatment of spontaneously developed mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice was sufficient to significantly reduce the rate of tumor growth and final tumor load in a dose dependent and statistically significant manner (P < 0.05). This decrease in tumor growth was correlated with decreased MMP-9 protein production within the treated tumor tissues.

Nuclear expression of 8-OHdG was observed in \u2265 50% of the tumor cells in all 15 cases of angiomatous meningioma and was associated with the presence of regressive histopathological findings, such as hyalinized vessels and cystic changes. In addition, the fraction of iron-containing tumor cells was correlated to those expressing 8-OHdG (P = 0.005).

Such an MSC population would be easily harvested in abundance, with minimal morbidity and with high purity. Our laboratories have identified perivascular stem cells (PSCs) as a candidate cell source. PSCs are readily isolatable through fluorescent-activated cell sorting from adipose tissue and have been previously shown to be indistinguishable from MSCs in the phenotype and differentiation potential. PSCs consist of two distinct cell populations: (1) pericytes (CD146+, CD34-, and CD45-), which surround capillaries and microvessels, and (2) adventitial cells (CD146-, CD34+, and CD45-), found within the tunica adventitia of large arteries and veins. We previously demonstrated the osteogenic potential of pericytes by examining pericytes derived from the human fetal pancreas, and illustrated their in vivo trophic and angiogenic effects. In the present study, we used an intramuscular ectopic bone model to develop the translational potential of our original findings using PSCs (as a combination of pericytes and adventitial cells) from human white adipose tissue. We evaluated human PSC (hPSC)-mediated bone formation and vascularization in vivo. We also examined the effects of hPSCs when combined with the novel craniosynostosis-associated protein, Nel-like molecule I (NELL-1). Implants consisting of the demineralized bone matrix putty combined with NELL-1 (3\u2009\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hPSC (2.5\u00d710(5) cells), or hPSC+NELL-1, were inserted in the bicep femoris of SCID mice. Bone growth was evaluated using microcomputed tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry over 4 weeks. Results demonstrated the osteogenic potential of hPSCs and the additive effect of hPSC+NELL-1 on bone formation and vasculogenesis. Comparable osteogenesis was observed with NELL-1 as compared to the more commonly used bone morphogenetic protein-2. Next, hPSCs induced greater implant vascularization than the unsorted stromal vascular fraction from patient-matched samples. Finally, we observed an additive effect on implant vascularization with hPSC+NELL-1 by histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry, accompanied by in vitro elaboration of vasculogenic growth factors. These findings hold significant implications for the cell/protein combination therapy hPSC+NELL-1 in the development of strategies for vascularized bone regeneration.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

The goal of this project was to develop a perfusion bioreactor system compatible with two-photon imaging to noninvasively assess tissue engineered human adipose tissue structure and function in vitro. Three-dimensional (3D) vascularized human adipose tissues were engineered in vitro, before being introduced to a perfusion environment and tracked over time by automated quantification of endogenous markers of metabolism using two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF). Depth-resolved image stacks were analyzed for redox ratio metabolic profiling and compared to prior analyses performed on 3D engineered adipose tissue in static culture. Traditional assessments with H&E staining were used to qualitatively measure extracellular matrix generation and cell density with respect to location within the tissue. The distribution of cells within the tissue and average cellular redox ratios were different between static and perfusion cultures, while the trends of decreased redox ratio and increased cellular proliferation with time in both static and perfusion cultures were similar.

The potential to regenerate may partly be due to activation of stem/progenitor cells localized in the tendon or its vicinity. In the present study, we attempted to determine where in the rat Achilles tendon stem/progenitor cells reside and to investigate the effect of exercise on cell proliferation in the in vivo situation.\nWe used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling to investigate proliferation and label-retaining cells (i.e. slow-cycling cells) in non-exercised and exercised rats, in combination with immunostaining of the stem cell marker nucleostemin. Rat Achilles tendons were harvested 14, 28, 56 and 105 days after BrdU administration.\nWe found the proportion of stem/progenitor cells to be twice as high in the distal tendon (DT) compared with the mid/proximal tendon (MPT) and that paratenon/endotenon regions appear to host a pool of existing stem/progenitor cells. Exercise increased the BrdU-stained cell population after 14 days only (DT region p = 0.032, MPT p = 0.065), indicating effect mainly on more differentiated cells, since the nucleostemin-positive cells (i.e. stem/progenitor cells) remained unaffected in the intact Achilles tendon.\nStem/progenitor cells exist in several areas of the rat Achilles tendon which implies a possible stem cell regeneration pool of different origins. The distal region has twice the amount of stem/progenitor cells compared with the mid/proximal region, indicating a potentially higher stem cell activity in this tissue.

Human platelet lysate (hPL) is composed of numerous growth factors known for their proliferative, differentiative and chemo-attractant effects on various cells involved in wound healing and bone growth. The aim of this study was to determine whether the delivery of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) seeded on hPL-coated hydroxyapatite/\u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (HA/\u03b2-TCP) scaffolds could enhance vascularization and bone formation, as well as to investigate the mechanisms by which hMSC participate in tissue regeneration. Our study demonstrates that hPL can be coated on HA/\u03b2-TCP scaffolds, which play direct and indirect effects on implanted and/or resident stem cells. Effectively, we show that hPL coating directly increases chemo-attraction to and adhesion of hMSC and endothelial cells on the scaffold. Moreover, we show that hPL coating induces hMSC to produce and secrete pro-angiogenic proteins (placental growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor) which allow the proliferation and specific chemo-attraction of endothelial cells in vitro, thus improving in vivo neovascularization and new bone formation.

At several times, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on grafted nude mice to evaluate the impact of ECs on vascularization.\nBoth models produced an extracellular matrix, without exogenous material, and developed a pseudostratified urothelium. Seven days after the graft, mouse red blood cells were present only in the outer layers in T model, but in the full thickness of ET model. After 14 days, erythrocytes were present in both models, but in a greater proportion in ET model. At day 28, both models were well-vascularized, with capillary-like structures in the whole thickness of the tubes.\nIncorporating endothelial cells was associated with an earlier vascularization of the grafts, which could decrease the necrosis of the transplanted tissue.

The intrinsic blood supply of the vascularized bone grafts leads to higher success rates and to acceleration of the repair process in the reconstruction of defects and necrotic lesions of the skeleton.", "journal": "Injury", "date": "2013-02-13", "authors": ["Panayotis NSoucacos", "Zinon TKokkalis", "MaraPiagkou", "Elizabeth OJohnson"], "doi": "10.1016/S0020-1383(13)70016-0"}
{"title": "Riparian ecosystems in human cancers.", "abstract": "Intratumoral evolution produces extensive genetic heterogeneity in clinical cancers. This is generally attributed to an increased mutation rate that continually produces new genetically defined clonal lineages. Equally important are the interactions between the heritable traits of cancer cells and their microenvironment that produces natural selection favoring some clonal 'species' over others. That is, while mutations produce the heritable variation, environmental selection and cellular adaptation govern the strategies (and genotypes) that can proliferate within the tumor ecosystem. Here we ask: What are the dominant evolutionary forces in the cancer ecosystem? We propose that the tumor vascular network is a common and primary cause of intratumoral heterogeneity. Specifically, variations in blood flow result in variability in substrate, such as oxygen, and metabolites, such as acid, that serve as critical, but predictable, environmental selection forces. We examine the evolutionary and ecological consequences of variable blood flow by drawing an analogy to riparian habitats within desert landscapes. We propose that the phenotypic properties of cancer cells will exhibit predictable spatial variation within tumor phenotypes as a result of proximity to blood flow. Just as rivers in the desert create an abrupt shift from the lush, mesic riparian vegetation along the banks to sparser, xeric and dry-adapted plant species in the adjacent drylands, we expect blood vessels within tumors to promote similarly distinct communities of cancer cells that change abruptly with distance from the blood vessel. We propose vascular density and blood flow within a tumor as a primary evolutionary force governing variations in the phenotypic properties of cancer cells thus providing a unifying ecological framework for understanding intratumoral heterogeneity.", "journal": "Evolutionary applications", "date": "2013-02-12", "authors": ["Khalid OAlfarouk", "Muntaser EIbrahim", "Robert AGatenby", "Joel SBrown"], "doi": "10.1111/eva.12015"}

How malignant cells cope with this potentially lethal metabolic stress remains poorly understood. We found that glucose shortage associated with malignant progression triggers apoptosis through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress is in part caused by reduced glucose flux through the hexosamine pathway. Deletion of the proapoptotic UPR effector CHOP in a mouse model of K-ras(G12V)-induced lung cancer increases tumor incidence, strongly supporting the notion that ER stress serves as a barrier to malignancy. Overcoming this barrier requires the selective attenuation of the PERK-CHOP arm of the UPR by the molecular chaperone p58(IPK). Furthermore, p58(IPK)-mediated adaptive response enables cells to benefit from the protective features of chronic UPR. Altogether, these results show that ER stress activation and p58(IPK) expression control the fate of malignant cells facing glucose shortage.", "journal": "Molecular cell", "date": "2013-02-12", "authors": ["Anne-LaureHuber", "JustineLebeau", "PatriciaGuillaumot", "VirginieP\u00e9trilli", "MouhannadMalek", "JulienChilloux", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9riqueFauvet", "L\u00e9aPayen", "AlainKfoury", "TouficRenno", "EricChevet", "Serge NMani\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.009"}

For in vivo analysis, CM-DiI-labeled ASCs were implanted with a rat cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) extract-derived hydrogel into a chamber with a femoral arteriovenous loop in the groin of male nude rats for 7 days. Vascularization in newly generated tissue was estimated by histomorphometry after endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) immunostaining. ASCs expressed growth factor mRNA and produced an angiogenic activity in vitro. After implantation, ASCs survived, but remained suspended in the ECM and relatively few were incorporated into the newly formed tissue. The volume of newly generated tissue was significantly higher in chambers containing ASCs and it was enriched with vasculature when compared with the ECM alone.

Previous studies have shown that heme oxygenase-1 and its reaction byproduct, carbon monoxide (CO), induce SDF-1\u03b1 expression in ischemic heart. However, the mechanism underlying heme oxygenase-1/CO-induced cardiac SDF-1\u03b1 expression remains elusive. This study aims to investigate the signaling pathway and the transcriptional factor that mediate CO-induced SDF-1\u03b1 gene expression and cardioprotection.\nCO gas and a CO-releasing compound, tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer, dose-dependently induced SDF-1\u03b1 expression in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cardiomyoblasts. Promoter luciferase-reporter assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the activator protein 2\u03b1 (AP-2\u03b1) mediated tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer-induced SDF-1\u03b1 gene transcription. Tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer induced AP-2\u03b1 expression via protein kinase B (AKT)-dependent signaling. AKT inhibition or AP-2\u03b1 knockdown reduced tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer-induced SDF-1\u03b1 expression. Coronary ligation induced transient increases of cardiac AP-2\u03b1 and SDF-1\u03b1 expression, which were declined at 1 week postinfarction in mice. Periodic exposure of coronary-ligated mice to CO (250 ppm for 1 hour/day, 6 days) resumed the induction of AP-2\u03b1 and SDF-1\u03b1 gene expression in infarcted hearts. Immunohistochemistry and echocardiography performed at 4 weeks after coronary ligation revealed that CO treatment enhanced neovascularization in the myocardium of peri-infarct region and improved cardiac function.

In particular, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR\u03b1) is expressed by multipotent cardiovascular progenitors in mouse and human embryonic stem cell systems. Although cardiac PDGFR\u03b1 expression has been studied in multiple species, little is known about its expression in the human heart. Using immunofluorescence, we analyzed PDGFR\u03b1 expression in both human fetal and diseased adult hearts, finding strong expression in the interstitial cells of the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium, as well as the coronary smooth muscle. Only rare endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes expressed PDGFR\u03b1. This pattern was consistent for both the fetal and adult diseased hearts, although more PDGFR\u03b1+ cardiomyocytes were noted in the latter. In vitro differentiation assays were then performed on the PDGFR\u03b1+ cell fraction isolated from the cardiomyocyte-depleted human fetal hearts. Protocols previously reported to direct differentiation to a cardiomyocyte (5-azacytidine), smooth muscle (PDGF-BB), or endothelial cell fates (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) were used. Although no significant cardiomyocyte differentiation was observed, PDGFR\u03b1+ cells generated significant numbers of smooth muscle cells (smooth muscle-\u03b1-actin+ and smooth muscle myosin+) and endothelial cells (CD31+). These data suggest that a subfraction of the cardiac PDGFR\u03b1+ populations are progenitors contributing predominantly to the vascular and mesenchymal compartments of the human heart.

{"title": "Organotypic brain slices: a model to study the neurovascular unit micro-environment in epilepsies.", "abstract": "It is now recognized that the neuro-vascular unit (NVU) plays a key role in several neurological diseases including epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and the development of gliomas. Most of these disorders are associated with NVU dysfunction, due to overexpression of inflammatory factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Various in vitro models have been developed previously to study the micro-environment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However none of these in vitro models contained a complete complement of NVU cells, nor maintained their interactions, thus minimizing the influence of the surrounding tissue on the BBB development and function. The organotypic hippocampal culture (OHC) is an integrative in vitro model that allows repeated manipulations over time to further understand the development of cell circuits or the mechanisms of brain diseases.\nOHCs were cultured from hippocampi of 6-7 day-old Sprague Dawley rats. After 2 weeks in culture, seizures were induced by application of kainate or bicuculline into culture medium. The regulation of BBB integrity under physiological and pathological conditions was evaluated by immunostaining of the main tight junction (TJ) proteins and of the basal membrane of microvessels. To mimic or prevent BBB disassembly, we used diverse pro- or anti-angiogenic treatments.\nThis study demonstrates that NVU regulation can be investigated using OHCs. We observed in this model system an increase in vascularization and a down-regulation of TJ proteins, similar to the vascular changes described in a chronic focus of epileptic patients, and in rodent models of epilepsy or inflammation. We observed that Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein disappeared after seizures associated with neuronal damage. In these conditions, the angiopoeitin-1 system was down-regulated, and the application of r-angiopoeitin-1 allowed TJ re-assembly.

PG-endoperoxide synthase expression in the endometrium was up-regulated on Day 1 and decreased on Day 5 after SP treatment compared to that in controls. PGF2alpha synthase levels were decreased on Day 5 and 10 in SP-treated animals when compared to controls. SP-induced vascular bed development was apparent shortly before the time corresponding to maternal recognition of pregnancy in the pig. Together, these data indicate that the porcine uterus can be sensitized shortly after SP exposure to evoke prolonged effects on PG synthesis and angiogenesis in the endometrium, persisting over the course of the prereceptive phase.

The objective of this study was to test whether anisotropic porous scaffolds with channels resulted in a more meniscus like matrix organization compared to isotropic porous scaffolds. Isotropic polyurethane scaffolds were made via standard solvent leaching techniques. Anisotropic porous scaffolds with channels were made via modified thermal induced phase separation. Both scaffold types were analyzed with light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and computed nano-tomography. Finally, isotropic and anisotropic scaffolds were bilaterally and subcutaneously implanted on the back of 32 Wistar rats for 1, 4, 8 and 24 weeks to assess tissue ingrowth and matrix organization. Isotropic scaffolds had a pore diameter of 35\u00b114.7\u00a0\u03bcm and a degree of anisotropy of 0.18, while anisotropic scaffolds had a channel diameter of 20\u00b16.0\u00a0\u03bcm and a degree of anisotropy of 0.39. After implantation full tissue ingrowth was achieved after 8 and 24 weeks for isotropic and anisotropic, respectively. Isotropic scaffolds had a random tissue infiltration with unorganized collagen deposition, whereas anisotropic scaffolds showed tissue infiltration and collagen alignment in the direction of the channels. Anisotropic scaffolds resulted in a matrix organization that resembled the tissue in the vascularized zone of the meniscus, while isotropic scaffolds resembled the tissue in the avascular zone of the meniscus.", "journal": "Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)", "date": "2013-02-07", "authors": ["E L Wde Mulder", "GHannink", "NVerdonschot", "PBuma"], "doi": "10.1088/1748-6041/8/2/025004"}
{"title": "Novel applications of contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging in vascular medicine.", "abstract": "The use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for vascular imaging indications has increased dramatically during the last decade. Ultrasound contrast agents are gas-filled microbubbles that are injected into the bloodstream and serve as strict intravascular reflectors of ultrasound waves. Numerous studies have addressed the potential clinical use of CEUS in different vascular fields including the carotid arteries, the abdominal aorta, renal arteries and the kidneys. In this review article we discuss the clinical value of contrast agents in vascular ultrasound by enhancing the vascular lumen, and more important, their role as a tool to deliver high resolution, real-time images of microvascular perfusion. Specifically, CEUS imaging of the carotid artery provides a novel, non-invasive method not only to improve the delineation of the vessel wall, but also for the assessment of the vasa vasorum and the ectopic vascularization of the atherosclerotic plaque (intraplaque neovascularization); probably providing a \"window\" to risk stratify atherosclerotic lesions and individuals by identifying \"vulnerable\" plaques prone to rupture causing vascular events. CEUS imaging has also emerged as a novel diagnostic tool in various aortic pathologies and particularly for the detection of endoleaks following endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. It is also a valuable tool for the assessment of the tissue perfusion in native and transplanted kidneys providing information on perfusion deficits of the parenchyma. Furthermore, a real-time CEUS method has recently been developed to assess the skeletal muscle microcirculation which could be used to study patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease or diabetic microangiopathy. In the future, the use of targeted microbubbles could further enhance and expand the diagnostic capabilities of current vascular ultrasound imaging by detecting specific molecular processes that play a role in the pathophysiology of vascular disease.", "journal": "VASA.

The reorganization is mediated by effector proteins recruited to the site of activity by locally-generated lipid second messengers. Phosphatidic acid (PA), a membrane phospholipid generated by multiple enzyme families including Phospholipase D (PLD), has been proposed to function in this role. Here, we show that macrophages prepared from mice lacking either of the classical PLD isoforms PLD1 or PLD2, or wild-type macrophages whose PLD activity has been pharmacologically inhibited, display isoform-specific actin cytoskeleton abnormalities that likely underlie decreases observed in phagocytic capacity. Unexpectedly, PA continued to be detected on the phagosome in the absence of either isoform and even when all PLD activity was eliminated. However, a disorganized phagocytic cup was observed as visualized by imaging PA, F-actin, Rac1, an organizer of the F-actin network, and DOCK2, a Rac1 activator, suggesting that PLD-mediated PA production during phagocytosis is specifically critical for the integrity of the process. The abnormal F-actin reorganization additionally impacted neutrophil migration and extravasation from the vasculature into interstitial tissues. Although both PLD1 and PLD2 were important in these processes, we also observed isoform-specific functions. PLD1-driven processes in particular were observed to be critical in transmigration of macrophages exiting the vasculature during immune responses such as those seen in acute pancreatitis or irritant-induced skin vascularization.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-02-06", "authors": ["Wahida HAli", "QinChen", "Kathleen EDelgiorno", "WenjuanSu", "Jason CHall", "TsunakiHongu", "HuasongTian", "YasunoriKanaho", "GilbertDi Paolo", "Howard CCrawford", "Michael AFrohman"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0055325"}
{"title": "Long-term functional reconstruction of segmental tracheal defect by pedicled tissue-engineered trachea in rabbits.", "abstract": "Due to lack of satisfactory tracheal substitutes, reconstruction of long segmental tracheal defects (>6 cm) is always a major challenge in trachea surgery. Tissue-engineered trachea (TET) provides a promising approach to address this challenge, but no breakthrough has been achieved yet in repairing segmental tracheal defect. The longest survival time only reached 60 days. The leading reasons for the failure of segmental tracheal defect reconstruction were mainly related to airway stenosis (caused by the overgrowth of granulation tissue), airway collapse (caused by cartilage softening) and mucous impaction (mainly caused by lack of epithelium). To address these problems, the current study proposed an improved strategy, which involved in vitro pre-culture, in vivo maturation, and pre-vascularization of TET grafts as well as the use of silicone stent. The results demonstrated that the two-step strategy of in vitro pre-culture plus in vivo implantation could successfully regenerate tubular cartilage with a mechanical strength similar to native trachea in immunocompetent animals. The use of silicone stents effectively depressed granulation overgrowth, prevented airway stenosis, and thus dramatically enhanced the survival rate at the early stage post-operation. Most importantly, through intramuscular implantation and transplantation with pedicled muscular flap, the TET grafts established stable blood supply, which guaranteed maintenance of tubular cartilage structure and function, accelerated epithelialization of TET grafts, and thus realized long-term functional reconstruction of segmental tracheal defects. The integration of all these improved strategies finally realized long-term survival of animals: 60% of rabbits survived over 6 months. The current improved strategy provided a promising approach for long-term functional reconstruction of long segmental tracheal defect.", "journal": "Biomaterials", "date": "2013-02-06", "authors": ["XusongLuo", "YiLiu", "ZhiyongZhang", "RanTao", "YuLiu", "AijuanHe", "ZongqiYin", "DanLi", "WenjieZhang", "WeiLiu", "YilinCao", "GuangdongZhou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.01.060"}

Between January 1998 and December 2008, seventy-eight patients presented with a Garden type III (n=38) or IV (n=40) femoral neck fracture. Thirty-eight patients were women and 40 were men, with an average age of 28 years (range, 16-38 years). Fractures were caused by fall injury (n=24), motor vehicle accident (n=36), and heavy weight lifting (n=18). Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A underwent internal fixation with 2 cannulated compression screws combined with an iliac graft supported by the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery (n=44), and group B underwent internal fixation with 3 cannulated compression screws (n=34). Average follow-up was 4.5 years (range, 2-8 years), and mean Harris Hip Score was 92 (range, 62-100) in group A and 84 (range, 40-100) in group B. Average fracture healing time at final follow-up was 4.4 months in group A and 6 months in group B. Two (4.5%) cases of osteonecrosis of the femoral head occurred in group A, and 8 (23.5%) cases occurred in group B. Internal fixation with 2 cannulated compression screws combined with an iliac graft supported by the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery is an effective surgical approach for treating femoral neck fractures in young adults to minimize the occurrence of fracture nonunion and osteonecrosis of the femoral head and to facilitate bone healing and functional recovery of the hip.", "journal": "Orthopedics", "date": "2013-02-06", "authors": ["Xiao-bingYu", "De-weiZhao", "Shi-zhenZhong", "Bao-yiLiu", "Ben-jieWang", "Yu-pengLiu", "YaoZhang", "Da-pingCui", "Da-pengFu", "HuiXie"], "doi": "10.3928/01477447-20130122-12"}

Transplant vascularization and trophic support are important for graft survival. However, very few studies have specifically addressed graft vascularization in patients with neurological disorders. In the present study, we analysed the vasculature of the host putamen and solid grafts of foetal striatal tissue transplanted into patients with Huntington's disease 9 and 12 years previously. Grafts were characterized by a significantly reduced number of large calibre blood vessels in comparison with the host brain. There were also significantly fewer astrocytes and gap junctions, suggesting a lack of functional blood-brain barrier components within the grafted tissue. Additionally, grafts demonstrated a nearly complete absence of pericytes (compared with the striatum) that are considered important for vascular stabilization and angiogenesis. Finally, the host striatum had a marked increase in atrophic astrocytes in comparison with controls and grafts. The extent to which the lower number of large calibre vessels and astrocytes within the transplants contributed to suboptimal graft survival is unknown. The marked increase in atrophic astrocytes in the host brain surrounding the grafts suggests that reduced host trophic support may also contribute to poor graft survival in Huntington's disease.

{"title": "Chronic ethanol exposure increases goosecoid (GSC) expression in human embryonic carcinoma cell differentiation.", "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a set of developmental malformations caused by excess alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Using an in vitro system, we examined the role that chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure plays in gene expression changes during the early stage of embryonic differentiation. We demonstrated that EtOH affected the cell morphology, cell cycle progression and also delayed the down-regulation of OCT4 and NANOG during differentiation. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis demonstrated that EtOH deregulates many genes and pathways that are involved in early embryogenesis. Follow-up analyzes revealed that EtOH exposure to embryoid bodies (EBs) induced the expression of an organizer-specific gene, goosecoid (GSC), in comparison to controls. Moreover, EtOH treatment altered several important genes that are involved in embryonic structure formation, nervous system development, and placental and embryonic vascularization, which are all common processes that FASD can disrupt. Specifically, EtOH treatment let to a reduction in ALDOC, ENO2 and CDH1 expression, whereas EtOH treatment induced the expression of PTCH1, EGLN1, VEGFA and DEC2 in treated EBs. We also found that folic acid (FA) treatment was able to correct the expression of the majority of genes deregulated by EtOH exposure during early embryo development. Finally, the present study identified a gene set including GSC, which was deregulated by EtOH exposure that may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).

Clinical diagnosis is difficult, but magnetic resonance imaging usually allows to identify the lesion. Located into the vascularized zone of the meniscus, management is preferentially arthroscopic, aimed at repairing the lesions with arthroscopic transosseous sutures or suture anchors.\nPubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and Ovid Medline were searched in July 2012 to find literature on MRT tears. We reviewed the literature on biomechanics, imaging features and current treatments of these tears. Twenty-seven appropriate articles were identified and included in the study: 6 biomechanical studies, 11 imaging-based investigations for diagnosis, 1 study on clinical diagnosis and 9 studies about treatment.\nMRTs are infrequent, accounting for 10.1% of all arthroscopic meniscectomies. When the damage occurs to the roots, the transmission of the circumferential hoop tension is impaired and, consequently, the menisci tend to be displaced anteriorly and posteriorly, altering the biomechanics and possibly the kinematics of the knee.\nAlthough the importance of the integrity of the meniscal roots is well established, their diagnosis and treatment are still controversial.\nBiomechanical and clinical studies demonstrate that surgical repair of acute, traumatic meniscal root injuries fully restores the biomechanical features of the menisci, leading to pain relief and functional improvement.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying such cardiac acclimation have been scarcely investigated in teleosts. Consequently, we studied mechanisms related to cardiac growth, contractility, vascularization, energy metabolism and myokine production in Atlantic salmon pre-smolts resulting from 10 weeks exercise-training at three different swimming intensities: 0.32 (control), 0.65 (medium intensity) and 1.31 (high intensity) body lengths s(-1). Cardiac responses were characterized using growth, immunofluorescence and qPCR analysis of a large number of target genes encoding proteins with significant and well-characterized function. The overall stimulatory effect of exercise on cardiac muscle was dependent on training intensity, with changes elicited by high intensity training being of greater magnitude than either medium intensity or control. Higher protein levels of PCNA were indicative of cardiac growth being driven by cardiomyocyte hyperplasia, while elevated cardiac mRNA levels of MEF2C, GATA4 and ACTA1 suggested cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, up-regulation of EC coupling-related genes suggested that exercised hearts may have improved contractile function, while higher mRNA levels of EPO and VEGF were suggestive of a more efficient oxygen supply network. Furthermore, higher mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b1, PGC1\u03b1 and CPT1 all suggested a higher capacity for lipid oxidation, which along with a significant enlargement of mitochondrial size in cardiac myocytes of the compact layer of fish exercised at high intensity, suggested an enhanced energetic support system.

The polypeptide chemokine PK2 (Bv8, PROK2) has been shown to regulate myeloid cell mobilization from the bone marrow, leading to activation of the angiogenic process, as well as accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in the tumor site. Neutralizing antibodies against PK2 were shown to display potent anti-tumor efficacy, illustrating the potential of PK2-antagonists as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. In this study we demonstrate the anti-tumor activity of a small molecule PK2 antagonist, PKRA7, in the context of glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer xenograft tumor models. For the highly vascularized glioblastoma, PKRA7 was associated with decreased blood vessel density and increased necrotic areas in the tumor mass. Consistent with the anti-angiogenic activity of PKRA7 in vivo, this compound effectively reduced PK2-induced microvascular endothelial cell branching in vitro. For the poorly vascularized pancreatic cancer, the primary anti-tumor effect of PKRA7 appears to be mediated by the blockage of myeloid cell migration/infiltration. At the molecular level, PKRA7 inhibits PK2-induced expression of certain pro-migratory chemokines and chemokine receptors in macrophages. Combining PKRA7 treatment with standard chemotherapeutic agents resulted in enhanced effects in xenograft models for both types of tumor. Taken together, our results indicate that the anti-tumor activity of PKRA7 can be mediated by two distinct mechanisms that are relevant to the pathological features of the specific type of cancer.

Endometrial fragments reach the peritoneal cavity during the fertile years: local cues decide whether they yield endometriotic lesions. Macrophages are recruited at sites of hypoxia and tissue stress, where they clear cell debris and heme-iron and generate pro-life and pro-angiogenesis signals. Macrophages are abundant in endometriotic lesions, where are recruited and undergo alternative activation. In rodents macrophages are required for lesions to establish and to grow; bone marrow-derived Tie-2 expressing macrophages specifically contribute to lesions neovasculature, possibly because they concur to the recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitors, and sustain their survival and the integrity of the vessel wall. Macrophages sense cues (hypoxia, cell death, iron overload) in the lesions and react delivering signals to restore the local homeostasis: their action represents a necessary, non-redundant step in the natural history of the disease. Endometriosis may be due to a misperception of macrophages about ectopic endometrial tissue.

Here, we overview RP-based bioprinting approaches and discuss the current challenges and trends toward fabricating living organs for transplant in the near future.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "date": "2013-02-02", "authors": ["Ibrahim TOzbolat", "YinYu"], "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2013.2243912"}
{"title": "A new model for preclinical testing of dermal substitutes for human skin reconstruction.", "abstract": "Currently, acellular dermal substitutes used for skin reconstruction are usually covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The goal of this study was to develop an animal model in which such dermal substitutes can be tested under standardized conditions using a bioengineered dermo-epidermal skin graft for coverage.\nBioengineered grafts consisting of collagen type I hydrogels with incorporated human fibroblasts and human keratinocytes seeded on these gels were produced. Two different dermal substitutes, namely Matriderm(\u00ae), and an acellular collagen type I hydrogel, were applied onto full-thickness skin wounds created on the back of immuno-incompetent rats. As control, no dermal substitute was used. As coverage for the dermal substitutes either the bioengineered grafts were used, or, as controls, human split-thickness skin or neonatal rat epidermis were used. Grafts were excised 21 days post-transplantation. Histology and immunofluorescence was performed to investigate survival, epidermis formation, and vascularization of the grafts.\nThe bioengineered grafts survived on all tested dermal substitutes. Epidermis formation and vascularization were comparable to the controls.\nWe could successfully use human bioengineered grafts to test different dermal substitutes.

The goal of this study was to investigate the role of fibroblasts (FBs) activated by tumor cell supernatants on the vascularization of transplanted pancreatic islets.\nPancreatic islets and activated or inactivated FBs were used for subrenal capsule transplantation. Mouse melanoma cell supernatants were used to activate FBs; the tests of the purity of the pancreatic islet cells of the donor, survival rate, and function of insulin secretion were performed to ensure high-quality transplants. Mice receiving the allogeneic transplantation were given tacrolimus and sirolimus to prevent rejection. The diabetic model was induced by streptozotocin.\nConditioned medium made of tumor cell supernatants was found to stimulate the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and vascular endothelial growth factor A to an extent notably greater than that of pancreatic islet transplantation alone or pancreatic islet transplantation combined with inactivated FBs. FBs from the recipient were associated with capillary density in the transplanted pancreatic islet most closely to that observed in isogenically transplanted pancreatic islets and the original pancreatic islet. In this way, activated FBs derived from the recipient combined with pancreatic transplantation were able to treat diabetes, and long-term survival was achieved.\nThe current research sheds new light on the revascularization of transplanted pancreatic islets: activated FBs derived from the recipients, when transplanted alongside pancreatic tissue, can promote revascularization inside the transplanted pancreatic islet.", "journal": "The Journal of surgical research", "date": "2013-02-02", "authors": ["DingzhiLiu", "HengXiao", "ChengyouDu", "ShiqiaoLuo", "DeweiLi", "LongPan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jss.2012.12.044"}

Hypoxia is a strong modulator of the secretome and well known stimuli to increase the secretion of pro-angiogenic molecules. In this manuscript, we employed a high throughput screening assay on an hMSCs cell line in order to identify small molecules that mimic hypoxia. Importantly, we show that the effect of these small molecules was cell type/species dependent, but we identified phenanthroline as a robust hit in several cell types. We show that phenanthroline induces high expression of hypoxia-target genes in hMSCs when compared with desferoxamine (DFO) (a known hypoxia mimic) and hypoxia incubator (2% O(2)). Interestingly, our microarray and proteomics analysis show that only phenanthroline induced high expression and secretion of another angiogenic cytokine, interleukin-8, suggesting that the mechanism of phenanthroline-induced hypoxia is distinct from DFO and hypoxia and involves the activation of other signaling pathways.

Long-term survival of reconstructed skeletal muscle is dependent on good vascularization. In this study, we upregulated angiogenic gene expression in myoblasts in an attempt to promote vascularization during repair of skeletal muscle defects. Skeletal myoblasts were isolated and expanded from newborn male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The cells were transfected with human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF-165) or human stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 transfection reagent, prior to seeding onto calf collagen scaffolds. Gene and protein overexpression was verified by ELISA, RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Cell-seeded scaffolds were transplanted into back muscle defects in female SD rats. At weeks 2, 4 and 8 after transplantation, Y chromosome detection was used to observe the survival of growth factor-producing cells within the scaffolds in vivo. Capillary density was investigated using microvessel density detection, haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining. We found that vascularization was enhanced by transfected myoblasts compared with non-transfected myoblasts. In addition, VEGF-165 and SDF-1 had a synergistic effect on vascularization during repair of skeletal muscle defects in vivo.

The adrenal gland is highly vascularized; thus, we hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction may actively participate in inflammation-related adrenal insufficiency. To address this hypothesis, we used the properties of developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), which is an endothelial-derived anti-inflammatory factor that antagonizes integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion. Here we identified that Del-1 is expressed in the adrenal gland and that its expression was down-regulated upon SIRS induction by systemic lipopolysaccharide administration. Furthermore, we observed increased leukocyte accumulation, inflammation, and higher apoptosis in the adrenal glands of Del-1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Strikingly, Del-1 deficiency was also associated with reduced corticosterone and ACTH levels 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide administration. Together, these data suggest that Del-1 may act as a gatekeeper of adrenal gland inflammation and may regulate the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response, thereby modulating adrenal (dys)function in the course of SIRS.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2013-02-01", "authors": ["WaldemarKanczkowski", "AntoniosChatzigeorgiou", "SylviaGrossklaus", "DavidSprott", "Stefan RBornstein", "TriantafyllosChavakis"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2012-1617"}

Extracellular HMGB1 is the prototypic endogenous 'danger signal' that triggers inflammation and immunity. Recent findings suggest that posttranslational modifications dictate the cellular localization and secretion of HMGB1. HMGB1 is actively secreted from immune cells and stressed cancer cells, or passively released from necrotic cells. During cancer development or administration of therapeutic agents including chemotherapy, radiation, epigenetic drugs, oncolytic viruses, or immunotherapy, the released HMGB1 may either promote or limit cancer growth, depending on the state of progression and vascularization of the tumor. Extracellular HMGB1 enhances autophagy and promotes persistence of surviving cancer cells following initial activation. When oxidized, it chronically suppresses the immune system to promote cancer growth and progression, thereby enhancing resistance to cancer therapeutics. In its reduced form, it can facilitate and elicit innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity, recruiting and activating immune cells, in conjunction with cytotoxic agents, particularly in early transplantable tumor models. We hypothesize that HMGB1 also functions as an epigenetic modifier, mainly through regulation of NF-kB-dependent signaling pathways, to modulate the behavior of surviving cancer cells as well as the immune cells found within the tumor microenvironment.

Various techniques such as local flap transfer and composite grafts have been reported for columellar lengthening, but the overall results remain unsatisfactory. Transferring a local flap cannot provide new tissue for the columella, which limits its application. Composite grafting can provide new tissue volume, and the composite tissue from the preauricular region has an excellent color and texture match. However, the lack of a stable blood supply for the composite graft restricts its clinical application due to problems such as viability, dimensions, and atrophy. To overcome these limitations, the authors harvested a vascularized preauricular flap for columella lengthening.\nBased on the superficial temporal vessels, the vascularized preauricular flap was harvested as a free flap and transferred to the columella region. The recipient vessels were angular vessels or facial vessels, and microsurgical anastomosis was performed between recipient vessels and the pedicle. The lateral femoral circumflex vessels were used as vascular grafts when the pedicle was not long enough.\nEight patients who had short columellas were reconstructed with vascularized preauricular flaps. Six flaps were harvested in a reverse fashion, and the remaining two flaps were harvested in an anterograde direction. All the flaps survived well and showed a good color and texture match without hypertrophic scars. An average of 13.3\u00a0mm improvement in length was obtained for the eight patients. Two patients underwent a secondary debulking procedure to thin the flap.\nThe free vascularized preauricular flap procedure is a reliable method for columellar lengthening and has wide clinical application.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

In this paper we demonstrate that cis-9,trans-11(c9,t11)-CLA stimulated the expression of angiopoietin like-4 (ANGPTL4) mRNA and protein accompanied by tube formation in first trimester placental trophoblast cells, HTR8/SVneo whereas the other CLA isomer, trans-10,cis-12 (t10,c12)-CLA had no such effects. c9,t11-CLA however did not stimulate expression of the most potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these cells. Silencing ANGPTL4 in these cells significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of c9,t11-CLA on tube formation, indicating the involvement of ANGPTL4. In addition, c9,t11-CLA increased the mRNA expression of several pro-angiogenic factors such as fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) in HTR8/SVneo cells. c9,t11-CLA also induced the uptake of docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3 (DHA), a stimulator of tube formation in these cells. Triacsin C, an acylCoA synthetase inhibitor, attenuated c9,t11-CLA induced DHA uptake, tube formation and cellular proliferation in HTR8/SVneo cells. Our data suggest that the c9,t11-CLA isomer may regulate angiogenic processes during early placentation via increased expression of ANGPTL4 and other pro-angiogenic factors such as FABP4, COX-2 and ADRP with concomitant increase in the uptake of DHA in these cells.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2013-01-29", "authors": ["SanjayBasak", "Asim KDuttaroy"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.01.012"}
{"title": "Therapeutic angiogenesis of three-dimensionally cultured adipose-derived stem cells in rat infarcted hearts.", "abstract": "To successfully treat myocardial infarction (MI), blood must be resupplied to the ischemic myocardium by inducing angiogenesis. Many studies report enhanced angiogenesis using stem cells; however, the therapeutic efficacy of cell transplant remains low because transplanted cells may not survive, be retained at the site of transplant, or develop into vascular tissue. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic potential of three-dimensional cell masses (3DCM) composed of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASC) in a rat MI model.\nFor formation of 3DCM, hASC were cultured on a substrate with immobilized fibroblast growth factor 2. The morphology and phenotypes of 3DCM were analyzed 1 day after culture. The cells (hASC and 3DCM, 5 \u00d7 10(5) cells) were injected into ischemic regions after ligation of the left coronary artery (n = 6 in each group). Cell retention ratio, therapeutic efficacy and vascularization were evaluated 4 weeks after transplant.\nA spheroid-type 3DCM, which included vascular cells (CD34(+)/CD31(+)/KDR(+)/\u03b1-SMA(+)) with high production of human vascular endothelial growth factor, was obtained. Infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were reduced in the 3DCM-injected group compared with the hASC-injected group. The retention ratio of hASC was 14-fold higher in the 3DCM-injected group. Many transplanted cells differentiated into endothelial and smooth muscle cells and formed vascular networks incorporated into host vessels.\nTransplant of 3DCM may be useful for angiogenic cell therapy to treat MI.", "journal": "Cytotherapy", "date": "2013-01-29", "authors": ["Ji HyunKim", "In SuPark", "YongdooPark", "YoungmeeJung", "Soo HyunKim", "Sang-HeonKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcyt.2012.11.016"}
{"title": "Alveolar distraction osteogenesis for dental implant rehabilitation following fibular reconstruction: a case series.", "abstract": "Alveolar distraction osteogenesis (ADO), a novel bone augmentation technique, is gaining acceptance in restoring the vertical bone discrepancy between the transplanted graft and the residual alveolar bone after mandibular reconstruction. This case series presents the outcomes of ADO in fibula-reconstructed mandibles rehabilitated with dental implants, with an emphasis on clinical indications, surgical protocol, clinical outcomes, histologic evidence, and complications.\nFive patients underwent fibula distraction procedures after undergoing mandibular reconstruction with a vascularized fibula bone graft. The indication for the application of ADO was for the correction of the vertical discrepancy between the top of the reconstructed fibula and the adjacent alveolar crest to achieve adequate vertical bone height before implant placement.\nThe mean vertical bone height achieved was 13.58 mm. Twenty-two dental implants were placed in 5 patients. All patients were rehabilitated with implant-supported prostheses. Bone biopsies showed the distracted area was filled with newly formed, bony trabeculae between the transported fibula and the basal segments. The most common complication was transient infection around the distractor rod.\nADO can be performed on fibula-reconstructed mandibles to achieve the restoration of alveolar height, which then can be rehabilitated with dental implant-supported prostheses. The procedure has a minor risk of infection associated with the distractor rod, which does not compromise the bone regeneration from distraction. Patients with mandibles reconstructed with fibulas can attain dental implant rehabilitation with ADO, achieving good esthetic and occlusal outcomes.", "journal": "Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons", "date": "2013-01-29", "authors": ["Lim KwongCheung", "Hannah Daile PChua", "FirdausHariri", "Edmond H NPow", "LiwuZheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.joms.2012.09.028"}

These amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) could potentially provide an autologous cell source for treatment of congenital defects identified during gestation, particularly cardiovascular defects. In this review, the various methods of isolating, sorting, and culturing AFSC are compared, along with techniques for inducing differentiation into cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells. Although research has not demonstrated complete and high-yield cardiac differentiation, AFSC have been shown to effectively differentiate into endothelial cells and can effectively support cardiac tissue. Additionally, several tissue engineering and regenerative therapeutic approaches for the use of these cells in heart patches, injection after myocardial infarction, heart valves, vascularized scaffolds, and blood vessels are summarized. These applications show great promise in the treatment of congenital cardiovascular defects, and further studies of isolation, culture, and differentiation of AFSC will help to develop their use for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cardiovascular therapies.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Radial glial neural progenitors regulate nascent brain vascular network stabilization via inhibition of Wnt signaling.", "abstract": "The cerebral cortex performs complex cognitive functions at the expense of tremendous energy consumption. Blood vessels in the brain are known to form stereotypic patterns that facilitate efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery. Yet little is known about how vessel development in the brain is normally regulated. Radial glial neural progenitors are well known for their central role in orchestrating brain neurogenesis. Here we show that, in the late embryonic cortex, radial glial neural progenitors also play a key role in brain angiogenesis, by interacting with nascent blood vessels and regulating vessel stabilization via modulation of canonical Wnt signaling. We find that ablation of radial glia results in vessel regression, concomitant with ectopic activation of Wnt signaling in endothelial cells. Direct activation of Wnt signaling also results in similar vessel regression, while attenuation of Wnt signaling substantially suppresses regression. Radial glial ablation and ectopic Wnt pathway activation leads to elevated endothelial expression of matrix metalloproteinases, while inhibition of metalloproteinase activity significantly suppresses vessel regression. These results thus reveal a previously unrecognized role of radial glial progenitors in stabilizing nascent brain vascular network and provide novel insights into the molecular cascades through which target neural tissues regulate vessel stabilization and patterning during development and throughout life.", "journal": "PLoS biology", "date": "2013-01-26", "authors": ["ShangMa", "Hyo JunKwon", "HeidiJohng", "KelingZang", "ZhenHuang"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pbio.1001469\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011863"}

Hyaluronan (HA) is a major constituent of the ECM. The hypotheses that 1) HA content is increased in the ECM of insulin-resistant skeletal muscle and 2) reduction of HA in the muscle ECM by long-acting pegylated human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) reverses high-fat (HF) diet-induced muscle insulin resistance were tested. We show that muscle HA was increased in HF diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and that treatment of PEGPH20, which dose-dependently reduced HA in muscle ECM, decreased fat mass, adipocyte size, and hepatic and muscle insulin resistance in DIO mice at 10 mg/kg. Reduced muscle insulin resistance was associated with increased insulin signaling, muscle vascularization, and percent cardiac output to muscle rather than insulin sensitization of muscle per se. Dose-response studies revealed that PEGPH20 dose-dependently increased insulin sensitivity in DIO mice with a minimally effective dose of 0.01 mg/kg. PEGPH20 at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg reduced muscle HA to levels seen in chow-fed mice, decreased fat mass, and increased muscle glucose uptake.

Content validity was used as the method for the first 2 stages. An expert panel reviewed the scale and repeated the process on a revised scale. Reliability was tested with a different expert panel that used the final scale on a sample of TM images in a test-retest and inter-rater and intra-rater agreements were calculated.\nThe scale was developed in 3 steps using expert committees. During the process the description of vascularization was judged to be of insufficient importance for our scale. Inter-rater agreement was moderate (\u03ba = 0.52) and intra-rater agreement was good (\u03ba = 0.66 to 0.89) in the test-retest of the final scale.\nThe developed AOM image-based grading scale demonstrates substantial inter- and intra-rater reliability with potential use in clinical research and telemedicine applications.

{"title": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation and tissue engineering.", "abstract": "For many living with the devastating aftermath of disfiguring facial injuries, extremity amputations, and other composite tissues defects, conventional reconstruction offers limited relief. Full restoration of the face or extremities with anatomic equivalents recently became possible with decades of advancements in transplantation and regenerative medicine. Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is the transfer of anatomic equivalents from immunologically and aesthetically compatible donors to recipients with severe defects. The transplanted tissues are \"composite\" because they include multiple types essential for function, for example, skin, muscle, nerves, and blood vessels. More than 100 patients worldwide have benefited from VCA, the majority receiving hand or face transplants. Despite its demonstrated results, the clinical practice of VCA is limited by center experience, public awareness, donor shortage, and the risks of lifelong immune suppression. Tissue engineering (TE) is the generation of customized tissues in the laboratory using cells, biomaterials and bioreactors. Tissue engineering may eventually supersede VCA in the clinic, because it bypasses donor shortage and immune suppression challenges. Billions of dollars have been invested in TE research and development, which are expected to result in a myriad of clinical products within the mid- to long-term. First, tissue engineers must address challenges such as vascularization of engineered tissues and maintenance of phenotype in culture. If these hurdles can be overcome, it is to be hoped that the lessons learned through decades of research in both VCA and TE will act synergistically to generate off-the-shelf composite tissues that can thrive after implantation and in the absence of immune suppression.", "journal": "The Journal of craniofacial surgery", "date": "2013-01-26", "authors": ["Ericka MBueno", "J RodrigoDiaz-Siso", "Geoffroy CSisk", "AkashChandawarkar", "HarrietKiwanuka", "BrookeLamparello", "Edward JCaterson", "BohdanPomahac"], "doi": "10.1097/SCS.0b013e318275f173"}

This review demonstrates an evolving perspective of head and neck reconstructive surgery incorporating the indications and advantages gained over a career that has developed in parallel with microsurgery, prefabrication, prelamination, and face transplant. All current conventional reconstructions for the most severe defects often involve multistage procedures, using every rung of the reconstructive ladder, and the end results can still be lacking despite our best efforts. Despite all the tailoring and planning of these multiple flap and multiple-stage reconstructions, in our experience, these interventions never quite exactly recapitulate the face and fall short of full restoration.

{"title": "Bone circulatory disturbances in the development of spontaneous bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis: a translational model for the pathogenesis of femoral head necrosis.", "abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of the vascularization of the avian growth plate and its subsequent role in the pathogenesis of bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO, femoral head necrosis). BCO sporadically causes high incidences of lameness in rapidly growing broiler (meat-type) chickens. BCO is believed to be initiated by micro-trauma to poorly mineralized columns of cartilage cells in the proximal growth plates of the leg bones, followed by colonization by hematogenously distributed opportunistic bacteria. Inadequate blood flow to the growth plate, vascular occlusion, and structural limitations of the microvasculature all have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BCO. Treatment strategies have been difficult to investigate because under normal conditions the incidence of BCO typically is low and sporadic. Rearing broilers on wire flooring triggers the spontaneous development of high incidences of lameness attributable to pathognomonic BCO lesions. Wire flooring imposes persistent footing instability and is thought to accelerate the development of BCO by amplifying the torque and shear stress imposed on susceptible leg joints. Wire flooring per se also constitutes a significant chronic stressor that promotes bacterial proliferation attributed to stress-mediated immunosuppression. Indeed, dexamethasone-mediated immunosuppression causes broilers to develop lameness primarily associated with avascular necrosis and BCO. Prophylactic probiotic administration consistently reduces the incidence of lameness in broilers reared on wire flooring, presumably by reducing bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract that likely contributes to hematogenous infection of the leg bones. The pathogenesis of BCO in broilers is directly relevant to osteomyelitis in growing children, as well as to avascular femoral head necrosis in adults. Our new model for reliably triggering spontaneous osteomyelitis in large numbers of animals represents an important opportunity to conduct translational research focused on developing effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments.", "journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "date": "2013-01-25", "authors": ["Robert FWideman", "Rhonda DPrisby"], "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2012.00183\n10.2307/1591650\n10.1084/jem.107.6.821\n10.3382/ps.0701936\n10.1354/vp.40-4-345\n10.1002/aja.1001140310\n10.3382/ps.0680873\n10.1097/00003086-199711000-00003\n10.1080/00071660902942783\n10.1016/0021-9975(85)90022-2\n10.1080/00071668.2012.675429\n10.1016/S0165-2427(02)00308-2\n10.1002/path.1711420203\n10.1016/0304-4165(96)00026-8\n10.1016/8756-3282(92)90249-V\n10.1002/jbmr.5650080908\n10.2307/1590672\n10.1111/j.1751-0813.1984.tb06015.x\n10.1002/ar.1091940110\n10.1159/000145345\n10.1354/vp.42-3-275\n10.2307/1590680\n10.1016/j.tvjl.2004.04.015\n10.1080/03079457.2011.619165\n10.1080/03079458308436164\n10.1111/j.1469-7998.1989.tb02498.x\n10.3382/ps.0730883\n10.1080/00071669208417536\n10.1080/00071669889349\n10.3382/ps.0730897\n10.2307/1590156\n10.2307/1590156\n10.1016/S0378-1135(98)00240-5\n10.2307/1590379\n10.2307/1590379\n10.2307/1589148\n10.1111/j.1751-0813.1972.tb09237.x\n10.1292/jvms1939.25.93\n10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.10.1647\n10.1016/S0034-5288(96)90014-4\n10.3382/ps.0701806\n10.2307/1589073\n10.2307/1590185\n10.1083/jcb.131.2.483\n10.1016/S0378-1135(99)00112-1\n10.1002/path.1700670110\n10.1177/104063871002200426\n10.2307/1592052\n10.1080/03079459408418991\n10.1080/03079459308418924\n10.1016/S0034-5288(97)90183-1\n10.1016/0034-5288(91)90030-R\n10.1093/cid/ciq198\n10.3382/ps.2012-02386\n10.3382/ps.2012-02386\n10.1053/rvsc.2000.0392\n10.1080/00071667008415822\n10.1080/00071667008415822\n10.3382/ps.2012-02244\n10.1080/713655061\n10.1002/art.1780401119\n10.1016/j.orthres.2004.03.006\n10.1016/j.bone.2003.07.011\n10.1016/j.bone.2004.08.016"}
{"title": "Techniques for fabrication and construction of three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional biomimetic scaffolds have widespread applications in biomedical tissue engineering because of their nanoscaled architecture, eg, nanofibers and nanopores, similar to the native extracellular matrix. In the conventional \"top-down\" approach, cells are seeded onto a biocompatible and biodegradable scaffold, in which cells are expected to populate in the scaffold and create their own extracellular matrix. The top-down approach based on these scaffolds has successfully engineered thin tissues, including skin, bladder, and cartilage in vitro. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate complex and functional tissues (eg, liver and kidney) due to the lack of vascularization systems and limited diffusion properties of these large biomimetic scaffolds. The emerging \"bottom-up\" method may hold great potential to address these challenges, and focuses on fabricating microscale tissue building blocks with a specific microarchitecture and assembling these units to engineer larger tissue constructs from the bottom up. In this review, state-of-the-art methods for fabrication of three-dimensional biomimetic scaffolds are presented, and their advantages and drawbacks are discussed. The bottom-up methods used to assemble microscale building blocks (eg, microscale hydrogels) for tissue engineering are also reviewed.

This area corresponds to the skin island of the dorsoradial flap. We report our clinical experience on seven patients where this flap was used for covering post-traumatic defects of the thumb. Dimensions of the defect varied from 18 to 28 cm(2). The donor site was skin grafted. All flaps survived and provided satisfactory coverage of the defect.

{"title": "A computationally efficient framework for the simulation of cardiac perfusion using a multi-compartment Darcy porous-media flow model.", "abstract": "We present a method to efficiently simulate coronary perfusion in subject-specific models of the heart within clinically relevant time frames. Perfusion is modelled as a Darcy porous-media flow, where the permeability tensor is derived from homogenization of an explicit anatomical representation of the vasculature. To account for the disparity in length scales present in the vascular network, in this study, this approach is further refined through the implementation of a multi-compartment medium where each compartment encapsulates the spatial scales in a certain range by using an effective permeability tensor. Neighbouring compartments then communicate through distributed sources and sinks, acting as volume fluxes. Although elegant from a modelling perspective, the full multi-compartment Darcy system is computationally expensive to solve. We therefore enhance computational efficiency of this model by reducing the N-compartment system of Darcy equations to N pressure equations, and N subsequent projection problems to recover the Darcy velocity. The resulting 'reduced' Darcy formulation leads to a dramatic reduction in algebraic-system size and is therefore computationally cheaper to solve than the full multi-compartment Darcy system. A comparison of the reduced and the full formulation in terms of solution time and memory usage clearly highlights the superior performance of the reduced formulation. Moreover, the implementation of flux and, specifically, impermeable boundary conditions on arbitrarily curved boundaries such as epicardium and endocardium is straightforward in contrast to the full Darcy formulation. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of our methodology to a personalized model and its solvability in clinically relevant time frames, we simulate perfusion in a subject-specific model of the left ventricle.", "journal": "International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering", "date": "2013-01-25", "authors": ["CMichler", "A NCookson", "RChabiniok", "EHyde", "JLee", "MSinclair", "TSochi", "AGoyal", "GVigueras", "D ANordsletten", "N PSmith"], "doi": "10.1002/cnm.2520"}

{"title": "Parameterisation of multi-scale continuum perfusion models from discrete vascular networks.", "abstract": "Experimental data and advanced imaging techniques are increasingly enabling the extraction of detailed vascular anatomy from biological tissues. Incorporation of anatomical data within perfusion models is non-trivial, due to heterogeneous vessel density and disparate radii scales. Furthermore, previous idealised networks have assumed a spatially repeating motif or periodic canonical cell, thereby allowing for a flow solution via homogenisation. However, such periodicity is not observed throughout anatomical networks. In this study, we apply various spatial averaging methods to discrete vascular geometries in order to parameterise a continuum model of perfusion. Specifically, a multi-compartment Darcy model was used to provide vascular scale separation for the fluid flow. Permeability tensor fields were derived from both synthetic and anatomically realistic networks using (1) porosity-scaled isotropic, (2) Huyghe and Van Campen, and (3) projected-PCA methods. The Darcy pressure fields were compared via a root-mean-square error metric to an averaged Poiseuille pressure solution over the same domain. The method of Huyghe and Van Campen performed better than the other two methods in all simulations, even for relatively coarse networks. Furthermore, inter-compartment volumetric flux fields, determined using the spatially averaged discrete flux per unit pressure difference, were shown to be accurate across a range of pressure boundary conditions.

At midgestation, the telencephalic vesicles are characterized by well developed radial glia cells (RGCs), the first differentiated astrocytes and a basic vascular network mainly built of radial vessels. RGCs have been recognized to contribute to cerebral cortex neuro-vascular architecture and have also been demonstrated to act as a significant source of neural cells (Rakic, Brain Res 33:471-476, 1971; Malatesta et al, Development 127:5253-5263, 2000). According to our hypothesis CXCL12, a potent migration and differentiation chemokine released by RGCs, may act as a linking factor coordinating neuroblast migration with vessel growth and patterning through the activation of different ligand/receptor axes. The obtained results support this hypothesis showing that together with CXCR4/CXCR7-reactive neuroblasts, which migrate in close association with CXCL12 RGCs, layer-specific subsets of CXCL12 RGCs and astrocytes specifically contact the microvessel wall.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed the porous morphology of the scaffolds and the amorphous nature of the inorganic phase with different crystallite sizes and the formation of various forms of calcium phosphate. Compressive mechanical testing revealed that the Young's modulus of the biomaterials is in the range of human trabecular bone. In vitro tests were performed on the biomaterials for up to 14\u00a0days to study the behavior of the osteoblast-like human cell line (MG63), primary human osteoblasts (HOS) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). The cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTS assay for cell metabolism and the detection of membrane integrity (lactate dehydrogenase-LDH release). An expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cell supernatants was quantified by ELISA. Cell viability gave values close to untreated controls for MG63 and HOS, while in the case of HDMEC the viability after 2 weeks in the cell culture was between 80-90%. The cytotoxicity induced by the Cs-CP scaffolds on MG63, HOS and HDMEC in vitro was evaluated by the amount of LDH released, which is a sensitive and accurate marker for cellular toxicity. The increased levels of VEGF obtained in the osteoblast culture highlights its important role in the regulation of vascularization and bone remodeling.

Thus, in a subset of patients either complete treatment is not possible or poses problems. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of new methods and materials allowing for a permanent replacement with body own soft tissue. A promising therapeutic approach is the soft tissue replacement with autologous adipose tissue. Innovative research on the reconstruction of soft tissue by adipose tissue, and clinical and experimental studies on the long-term survival and transplantation of autologous adipose tissue showed that the free fat tissue graft without direct vascular connection come along with disappointing results. Often a loss of volume or a complete resorption of the graft because of insufficient tissue quality by lack of cell differentiation was observed. This fact points to the special role of the maintenance and development of the graft's blood supply (angiogenesis and vascularization) crucial for maintaining a constant volume of the tissue. The rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of tissue engineering offers alternative solutions to the existing treatment options with the aim to produce autologous adipose tissue, stable in volume in vitro as well as in vivo, which can be transplanted as a permanent tissue replacement to corresponding parts of the body. Numerous studies have demonstrated the important and most critical factor of vascularisation for quality, volume and long-term survival of transplanted newly generated adipose tissue constructs. Although our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of adipogenesis is still limited, there are clear indications that the complex sequences of cell interactions in the differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes is directly related to angiogenesis.", "journal": "Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...", "date": "2013-01-24", "authors": ["J HDolderer", "FMedved", "R MHaas", "D ISiegel-Axel", "S MSchiller", "H-ESchaller"], "doi": "10.1055/s-0032-1329944"}

A Harris Hip Score was obtained during follow-ups, evaluating the clinical efficacy, X-rays were taken regularly for image assessing, and the SF-36 scale was used for estimating quality of life. Terminal observation time was considered when patients had symptom-dependant indications for performing another hip-preserving surgery or THA surgery.\nFifty-eight patients (64 hips) were eventually contacted by telephone for an out-patient clinic return visit, with a mean follow-up time of 35.8 months (varied from 12 months to 60 months), but two patients lost contact for various reasons. The demographic data were as follows: there were 16 ARCO IIIA cases, 22 ARCO IIIB cases, and 26 ARCO IIIC cases, respectively. Postoperative X-rays revealed a well-repaired necrotic area of the femoral head and improvement of femoral-acetabulum coverage. The last follow-up mean Harris Hip Score was 86.56\u2009\u00b1\u20097.38 (excellent results reached 87.50%), which were greatly improved compared to 50.95\u2009\u00b1\u20096.86 pre-operatively. Also the postoperative mean scores of all dimensions of the SF-36 scale were improved to some extent. Additionally the physical component summary (PSC) scores were enhanced from 42\u2009\u00b1\u200913 pre-operatively to 78\u2009\u00b1\u200911, while the postoperative mental component summary (MCS) scores (76\u2009\u00b1\u200911) largely increased in contrast to pre-operative scores (51\u2009\u00b1\u200910), with both target indices having statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.005, p\u2009=\u20090.01), signifying hugely improvement of the quality of life of the patients. A correlation was found between Harris Hip Score and all dimensions of SF-36 scale (r\u2009=\u20090.32-0.72), especially closely correlated with physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP) and bodily pain (BP) in PCS aspect (r\u2009=\u20090.72, p\u2009<\u20090.01; r\u2009=\u20090.58, p\u2009<\u20090.01; r\u2009=\u20090.65, p\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively).\nThere is definite curative efficacy for the treatment of ONFH with an hip-preserving operative approach by grafting a vascularized greater trochanter flap combined with a free iliac flap which was tightly filled by hammering. This kind of operative approach reconstructs the biological stability of femoral head, which promotes repair of necrotic areas and indirectly preserves the femoral head of patients and a majority of hip function. It possesses vast clinical as well as practical significance, because the long-term efficacy can satisfy fundamental life requirements, especially for those young and middle-aged patients who suffer ONFH to avoid or put off the time of total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgery.", "journal": "International orthopaedics", "date": "2013-01-24", "authors": ["Yi-RongZeng", "ShengHe", "Wen-JunFeng", "Fei-longLi", "JieLi", "Lin-YangJian", "Jian-ChunZeng", "Yue-GuangFan"], "doi": "10.1007/s00264-012-1773-5\n10.1007/s00264-012-1619-1\n10.1007/s00264-008-0672-2\n10.1007/s00264-008-0584-1\n10.1007/s00264-012-1612-8\n10.1007/s00264-009-0878-y\n10.1097/00003086-199603000-00020\n10.1007/s00402-004-0777-z\n10.1302/0301-620X.83B2.11503\n10.1007/s00432-007-0330-x\n10.1007/s00264-010-1138-x\n10.1007/s00264-007-0455-1\n10.1007/s10585-006-9004-3\n10.1302/0301-620X.88B4.16950\n10.1016/j.arth.2006.12.042\n10.1097/01.blo.0000192365.58958.84\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2007.03.028\n10.1007/s00264-009-0829-7\n10.1302/0301-620X.91B3.21846\n10.1186/1471-2474-8-78\n10.1007/s00264-012-1674-7\n10.1007/s00264-010-1031-7\n10.1007/BF00454690\n10.1023/B:ABME.0000007798.78548.b8\n10.2106/JBJS.H.01105"}

We studied six patients who underwent significant resection of the tip and dorsum of the nose for squamous or basal cell carcinoma. All involved nasal subunits were removed. Nasal reconstruction was subsequently performed using an inferiorly bipedicled pivoted composite nasal septal flap combined with a regional flap for skin coverage. The bipedicled SPF provided excellent support of the nasal tip in all six cases. All flaps in the cohort survived. Five patients had good mucosal lining from the septal flap alone and only one patient required a concurrent pericranial flap. Three patients experienced bleeding and required additional nasal packing. A bipedicled septal pivoted flap is exceptionally useful in providing a good tip support and well-vascularized nasal lining for reconstruction after major resection of the nasal tip.

One such process, angiogenesis, is required for tumor growth and metastasis, and many new cancer therapies are therefore directed against the tumor vasculature. Using an in vitro co-culture endothelial cord formation assay, a surrogate of angiogenesis, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK in growth factor- and tumor-driven angiogenesis using LY2228820 dimesylate treatment and by shRNA gene knockdown. p38 MAPK was activated in endothelial cells upon growth factor stimulation, with inhibition by LY2228820 dimesylate treatment causing a significant decrease in VEGF-, bFGF-, EGF-, and IL-6-induced endothelial cord formation and an even more dramatic decrease in tumor-driven cord formation. In addition to involvement in downstream cytokine signaling, p38 MAPK was important for VEGF, bFGF, EGF, IL-6, and other proangiogenic cytokine secretion in stromal and tumor cells. LY2228820 dimesylate results were substantiated using p38\u03b1 MAPK-specific shRNA and shRNA against the downstream p38 MAPK effectors MAPKAPK-2 and HSP27. Using in vivo models of functional neoangiogenesis, LY2228820 dimesylate treatment reduced hemoglobin content in a plug assay and decreased VEGF-A-stimulated vascularization in a mouse ear model.

{"title": "Quantification of microvascular cerebral blood flux and late-stage tumor compartmentalization in 9L gliosarcoma using flow enhanced MRI.", "abstract": "Measurements of tumor microvasculature are important to obtain an understanding of tumor angiogenesis and for the evaluation of therapies. In this work, we characterize the evolution of the microvascular flux at different stages of tumor growth in the 9L rat brain tumor model. The absolute quantification of cerebral blood flux is achieved with MRI at 7 T using the flow enhanced signal intensity (FENSI) method. FENSI flux maps were obtained between 5 and 14 days after glioma cell inoculation. Based on cerebral blood flux maps, we highlighted two main stages of tumor growth, below and above 3 mm, presenting distinct flux patterns and vascular properties. No significant difference emerged from the group analysis performed on the data collected at an early developmental stage (tumor size\u2009<\u20093 mm) when compared with healthy tissue. At a late developmental stage (tumor size\u2009>\u20093 mm), we observed a significant decrease in the cerebral blood flux inside the gliosarcoma (-33%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and compartmentalization of the tumor (p\u2009<\u20090.05). FENSI flux maps delineated a low-flux tumor core (58\u2009\u00b1\u200917 \u03bcL/min/cm(2) ) and higher vascularized regions around the tumor periphery (85\u2009\u00b1\u200921 \u03bcL/min/cm(2) ).

Pathway analysis using the MetaCore\u2122 platform and literature research suggested a striking upregulation of transcripts related to extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions. Upregulation of a number of major angiogenetic factors confirms previous observations that HUVECs enter a proangiogenic state upon cocultivation with osteoblasts.

In this study, we define a novel function for epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) in the control of angiogenesis. EMP2 functions as an oncogene in endometrial cancer, and its expression has been linked to decreased survival. Using endometrial cancer xenografts, modulation of EMP2 expression resulted in profound changes to the tumor microvasculature. Under hypoxic conditions, upregulation of EMP2 promoted vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) expression through a HIF-1\u03b1-dependent pathway and resulted in successful capillary-like tube formation. In contrast, reduction of EMP2 correlated with reduced HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF expression with the net consequence of poorly vascularized tumors in vivo. We have previously shown that targeting of EMP2 using diabodies in endometrial cancer resulted in a reduction of tumor load, and since then we have constructed a fully human EMP2 IgG1.

{"title": "Ectopic extramedullary hematopoiesis: evaluation and treatment of a rare and benign paraspinal/epidural tumor.", "abstract": "Ectopic extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), defined as the formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow, usually occurs in a scenario of chronic anemia when, even after conversion of the bony yellow marrow to red marrow, the body is still unable to meet the demand for red blood cells. Ectopic extramedullary hematopoiesis most commonly occurs in the liver and spleen but may, in fact, occur almost anywhere in the body. Although previous reports have documented EMH presenting as paraspinal masses, such lesions have almost always been associated with a predisposing hematological disorder such as hemolytic anemia, myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndromes, thalassemia, polycythemia vera, leukemia, or lymphoma. The authors of this report describe the first reported instance of EMH in a patient presenting with a symptomatic epidural and paraspinal cervical lesion arising from the posterior spinal elements and no known predisposing hematological disease. Initial radiographs revealed a bony lesion arising posteriorly from the C2-3 laminae and spinous processes. Subsequent imaging suggested the diagnosis, which was confirmed by CT-guided biopsy, peripheral blood smears, and bone marrow aspirate. Despite epidural compression and slight displacement of the cervical cord and thecal sac, the patient's symptoms were limited to pain and diminished cervical range of motion. Therefore, surgery was deferred in favor of nonsurgical therapy. Several alternative modalities for the treatment of EMH have been suggested in the literature, including cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy. The authors opted for an approach utilizing directed low-dose radiotherapy of a total of 25 Gy divided in 2.5-Gy fractions. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient continued to be asymptomatic, and MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in the dimensions of the lesion. Extramedullary hematopoiesis with spinal cord compression in the absence of a preexisting hematological disorder has not been described in the context of clinical neurosurgical practice. Recognizing that EMH may present as an epidural or paraspinal lesion is important since chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective therapeutic options in the majority of patients who suffer few if any symptoms. Extensive evaluation for underlying hematological disorders is necessary before undertaking directed therapy.

To this end, testes were removed from 5 groups of 3 mice each at 1 h (H1), 4 days (D4), 21 days (D21), 45 days (D45) and 90 days (D90) after the injection of 7.28\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2079 particles in the tibialis anterior muscles of each mouse. We examined histological sections from these samples by epifluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy and identified testicular biodistribution of a small number of particles in groups H1, D4, D21, D45 and D90. Using CD11b immunostaining, we showed that particles were not carried into the testis by macrophages. The intratesticular repartition of particles mainly followed testicular vascularization. Finally, we found some particles in seminiferous tubules but could not determine if the blood-testis barrier was crossed.", "journal": "Biomedical microdevices", "date": "2013-01-19", "authors": ["J-PKlein", "DBoudard", "JCadusseau", "SPalle", "VForest", "JPourchez", "MCottier"], "doi": "10.1007/s10544-013-9741-4"}
{"title": "Attachment of flexible heparin chains to gelatin scaffolds improves endothelial cell infiltration.", "abstract": "Long-term survival of implanted cells requires oxygen and nutrients, the need for which is met by vascularization of the implant. The use of scaffolds with surface-attached heparin as anchoring points for angiogenic growth factors has been reported to improve this process. We examined the potential role of surface modification of gelatin scaffolds in promoting endothelial cell infiltration by using a unique macromolecular conjugate of heparin as a coating. Compared to other heparin coatings, this surface modification provides flexible heparin chains, representing a new concept in heparin conjugation. In vitro cell infiltration of scaffolds was assessed using a three-dimensional model in which the novel heparin surface, without growth factors, showed a 2.5-fold increase in the number of infiltrating endothelial cells when compared to control scaffolds. No additional improvement was achieved by adding growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor and/or fibroblast growth factor-2) to the scaffold. In vivo experiments confirmed these results and also showed that the addition of angiogenic growth factors did not significantly increase the endothelial cell infiltration but increased the number of inflammatory cells in the implanted scaffolds. The endothelial cell-stimulating ability of the heparin surface alone, combined with its growth factor-binding capacity, renders it an interesting candidate surface treatment to create a prevascularized site prepared for implantation of cells and tissues, in particular those sensitive to inflammation but in need of supportive revascularization, such as pancreatic islets of Langerhans.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Recent efforts to identify new targets to inhibit tumor angiogenesis have identified Bv8 (prokineticin 2), a myeloid cell-derived protein that promotes endothelial cell growth and tumor angiogenesis, but many mechanistic aspects of the pro-tumorigenic function of Bv8 are unclear. Here we demonstrate that CD11b+, Ly6C+, Ly6G+ granulocytes are the predominant cell source of Bv8 expression in bone marrow, spleen and in tumor tissues. Using granulocyte-deficient Growth factor independence-1 (Gfi1)-null mutant mice and normal littermates, we found that EL4 lymphoma tumors grow significantly larger in the granulocyte and Bv8-deficient mutant mice in comparison to the normal mice that display abundant tumor-associated granulocytes and Bv8 expression. Conversely, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC-1) tumors grew to a significantly greater size in the normal mice in comparison to the Gfi1-null mice, but normal granulocyte tumor infiltration was modest. Quantitative analysis of tissue vascularization showed that EL4 and LLC-1 tumors from normal and Gfi1-mutant mice are similarly vascularized. These results confirm the critical contribution of the tumor microenvironment in determining the rate of tumor progression independently of tumor angiogenesis, and reveal some of the complexities of granulocyte and Bv8 functions in modulating tumor growth.", "journal": "Cureus", "date": "2013-01-18", "authors": ["KanJiang", "HyeongilKwak", "GiovannaTosato"], "doi": "10.7759/cureus.82"}
{"title": "Adult zebrafish as a model system for cutaneous wound-healing research.", "abstract": "Upon injury, the skin must quickly regenerate to regain its barrier function. In mammals, wound healing is rapid and scar free during embryogenesis, whereas in adults it involves multiple steps including blood clotting, inflammation, re-epithelialization, vascularization, and granulation tissue formation and maturation, resulting in a scar. We have established a rapid and robust method to introduce full-thickness wounds onto the flank of adult zebrafish, and show that apart from external fibrin clot formation, all steps of adult mammalian wound repair also exist in zebrafish. Wound re-epithelialization is extremely rapid and initiates with no apparent lag phase, subsequently followed by the immigration of inflammatory cells and the formation of granulation tissue, consisting of macrophages, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and collagen. The granulation tissue later regresses, resulting in minimal scar formation. Studies after chemical treatment or with transgenic fish further suggest that wound re-epithelialization occurs independently of inflammation and fibroblast growth factor signaling, whereas both are essential for fibroblast recruitment and granulation tissue formation. Together, these results demonstrate that major steps and principles of cutaneous wound healing are conserved among adult mammals and adult zebrafish, making zebrafish a valuable model for studying vertebrate skin repair.", "journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "date": "2013-01-18", "authors": ["RebeccaRichardson", "KrasimirSlanchev", "ChristopherKraus", "PhilippKnyphausen", "SabineEming", "MatthiasHammerschmidt"], "doi": "10.1038/jid.2013.16"}

This may lead to early hip fusion or hip arthroplasty. Free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) may provide a reasonable means to preserve the femoral head.\nWe asked: (1) What percentage of patients with AVN after SCFE treated with FVFG underwent subsequent THA or hip fusion and what was the lifespan of the FVFG? (2) Did the graft survival rate of FVFG for AVN after SCFE coincide with historically reported rates of FVFG for idiopathic AVN? And (3) did hip function improve after FVFG?\nWe retrospectively reviewed 52 patients who underwent FVFG for SCFE. We calculated the longevity of the graft and factors associated with graft survival. Harris hip scores (HHS) were recorded pre- and postoperatively. Minimum followup was 1 month (median, 19 months; range, 1-136 months).\nFive of the 52 patients (10%) underwent conversion to THA (four) or hip fusion (one). Mean age was greater in these patients than in those not requiring further procedures: 16 versus 13 years. Median graft survival time before arthroplasty/fusion was 12 years (range, 2-16 years) while it is currently 8 years (range, 2-16 years) in patients not undergoing subsequent procedures. HHSs improved 35 points on average (38 points preoperatively to 73 points postoperatively).\nIn patients undergoing FVFG for AVN secondary to SCFE, 90% have maintained their native hips for 8 years with improved hip function, similar to other published reports of FVFG.

Improvements in this risk-benefit ratio can be achieved by achieving tolerance and preventing rejection. Five decades after Dr. Joseph E. Murray introduced the field of transplantation to the world, we now have a better understanding of the immunologic factors that may contribute to rejection and inhibit tolerance. In this article, we review emerging evidence that suggests that \"danger signals\" associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury contribute to innate immune activation, promoting rejection, and inhibiting tolerance.

{"title": "mTORC1 inhibition restricts inflammation-associated gastrointestinal tumorigenesis in mice.", "abstract": "Gastrointestinal cancers are frequently associated with chronic inflammation and excessive secretion of IL-6 family cytokines, which promote tumorigenesis through persistent activation of the GP130/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Although tumor progression can be prevented by genetic ablation of Stat3 in mice, this transcription factor remains a challenging therapeutic target with a paucity of clinically approved inhibitors. Here, we uncovered parallel and excessive activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) alongside STAT3 in human intestinal-type gastric cancers (IGCs). Furthermore, in a preclinical mouse model of IGC, GP130 ligand administration simultaneously activated mTORC1/S6 kinase and STAT3 signaling. We therefore investigated whether mTORC1 activation was required for inflammation-associated gastrointestinal tumorigenesis. Strikingly, the mTORC1-specific inhibitor RAD001 potently suppressed initiation and progression of both murine IGC and colitis-associated colon cancer. The therapeutic effect of RAD001 was associated with reduced tumor vascularization and cell proliferation but occurred independently of STAT3 activity. We analyzed the mechanism of GP130-mediated mTORC1 activation in cells and mice and revealed a requirement for JAK and PI3K activity but not for GP130 tyrosine phosphorylation or STAT3. Our results suggest that GP130-dependent activation of the druggable PI3K/mTORC1 pathway is required for inflammation-associated gastrointestinal tumorigenesis.

The results showed that 28 days postsurgery the animals treated with ALN had areas of exposed and necrotic bone, associated with significant infection, especially in the interalveolar septum area and crestal regions, compared with controls. The levels of CTX, BALP and bone volume, as well as the degrees of inflammation and vascularization, were significantly reduced in these animals.

His particular interest in the thalamus eventually led to the identification of an anatomic variation in its vascular supply. This newly identified artery was subsequently named the artery of Percheron (AOP). Given the estimated prevalence of the AOP in up to one third of the population and its significant proportion of all thalamic infarcts, it is necessary for physicians to be aware of this anatomic vascular variant and its clinical consequences. Although occlusion of the AOP may present similar to other arterial thalamic occlusions, it can be identified through susceptibility-weighted imaging and ruled out with conventional or magnetic resonance angiography. Occlusion of the AOP typically causes a simultaneous and symmetric infarction. Treatment efficacy is time-dependent and necessitates thrombolytics and anticoagulative medications.

In vitro, the addition of IL-1\u03b2 and OSM promoted acanthosis and destructuring of reconstructed epidermis. Exogenous IL-1\u03b2 and OSM synergistically induced epidermal acanthosis in mice. These data show that OSM and IL-1\u03b2 are not only a biological characteristic signature of HLU, but these cytokines reflect a specific inflammatory state, directly involved in the pathogenesis.

Our results showed that the proliferation and attachment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were substantially improved by P(PEGMA)-REDV conjugation compared to pristine Ti surfaces, whilst no significant effects were observed for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), thus confirming the selectivity of REDV for ECs. Platelets adhesion assay further revealed that the immobilization of PEGMA polymer brushes led to the amelioration of surface hemocompatibility, and this enhancement was not negated by the conjugation of REDV.

This involved the use of high-speed camera to capture the temporal development of the spray as it is atomized through actuation of the spray device. An image-processing technique based on edge detection was developed to automate processing through the large number of images captured. The results showed that there are three main phases of spray development (prestable, stable, and poststable) that can be correlated by examining the spray width.

{"title": "Controlled copper ion release from phosphate-based glasses improves human umbilical vein endothelial cell survival in a reduced nutrient environment.", "abstract": "The success of tissue engineering is dependent on rapid scaffold vascularization after engraftment. Copper ions are well known to be angiogenic but exhibit cytotoxicity at elevated doses. The high sensitivity to copper concentration underlines the need of a controlled release mechanism. This study investigated the effect of copper ions released from phosphate-based glasses (PGs) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under standard growth conditions (SGC), as well as in a reduced nutrient environment (RNE) with decreased bovine serum and growth factor concentrations to approximate conditions in the core of large volume scaffolds where nutrient diffusion is limited. Initially, HUVECs were exposed to a range of CuCl(2) concentrations in order to identify an optimal response in terms of their metabolism, viability, and apoptotic activity. Under SGC, HUVEC metabolic activity and viability were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 0.44-12 ppm Cu(2+). In contrast, HUVEC death induced by the RNE was delayed by an optimal dose of 4 ppm Cu(2+), which was associated with a down-regulation of apoptosis as evidenced by caspase-3/7 activity. Copper ion release from soluble PGs of the formulation 50P(2)O(5)-30CaO-(20-x)Na(2)O-xCuO [mol%] (x=0, 1, 5 and 10) demonstrated a controllable increase with CuO content. The presence of 4 ppm copper ions released from the 10% CuO PG composition reproduced the delay in HUVEC death in the RNE, suggesting the potential of these materials to extend survival of transplanted endothelial cells in large volume scaffolds.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

It is thus well known that the enhancement of vascularization is of great importance in bone tissue engineering. As a potential approach for repairing bone defects, bone tissue constructs should therefore replicate the essential components in vivo microenvironments to promote cell osteogenic differentiation while at same time induce angiogenic response. In light of standpoint above, a combination of human bone-derived scaffolds and BMSCs that subjected to hypoxia was used to mimic in vivo conditions. Also the underlying cellular/molecular regulation was fully investigated. The results showed that hypoxia (5-10% O2 ) greatly enhanced the proliferation of BMSCs seeded in scaffolds, although the hypoxia (5% O2 )-induced proliferative effect on BMSC cellular scaffolds was not apparent to those cultured in plates. However, such a kind of model was able to significantly induce the osteogenic/angiogenic responses of BMSCs as reflected by osteogenesis or angiogenesis-related highly expressed genes or proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, ERK1/2 and/or p38 pathways were demonstrated to play essential roles in hypoxia-induced osteogenic/angiogenic responses.

Parameters investigated included survival, lung and heart histopathology, right ventricular function, fibrin deposition, and differential mRNA expression in the lungs. In the early treatment model, we investigated the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 25 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) during ambrisentan treatment. In the early treatment model, ambrisentan improved survival with reduced lung fibrin and collagen III deposition, arterial medial wall thickness, and RVH. These changes were not affected by L-NAME administration. Ambrisentan did not reduce the influx of macrophages and neutrophils or prevent reduced irregular elastin expression. In the late treatment model, ambrisentan diminished PAH, RVH, and right ventricular peak pressure, demonstrating that RVH is reversible in the neonatal period.

Discarded tissue samples were collected from severely burned patients undergoing wound debridement. Stem cells were isolated from the adipose tissue layer and their growth and immunophenotype characterized. To develop a skin equivalent, debrided skin adipose stem cells (dsASCs) were added to a collagen-polyethylene glycol (PEG) fibrin-based bilayer hydrogel and analyzed in vitro. The effect of the bilayered hydrogels on wound healing was demonstrated using an excision wound model in athymic rats. The dsASCs isolated from all samples were CD90, CD105, and stromal cell surface protein-1 positive, similar to adipose stem cells isolated from normal human lipoaspirates. Within the bilayer hydrogels, dsASCs proliferated and differentiated, maintained a spindle-shaped morphology in collagen, and developed a tubular microvascular network in the PEGylated fibrin. Rat excision wounds treated with bilayer hydrogels showed less wound contraction and exhibited better dermal matrix deposition and epithelial margin progression than controls. Stem cells can be isolated from the adipose layer of burned skin obtained during debridement. When dsASCs are incorporated within collagen-PEGylated fibrin bilayer hydrogels, they develop stromal and vascular phenotypes through matrix-directed differentiation without use of growth factors.

{"title": "Role and regulation of vascularization processes in endochondral bones.", "abstract": "Adequate vascularization is an absolute requirement for bone development, growth, homeostasis, and repair. Endochondral ossification during fetal skeletogenesis is typified by the initial formation of a prefiguring cartilage template of the future bone, which itself is intrinsically avascular. When the chondrocytes reach terminal hypertrophic differentiation they become invaded by blood vessels. This neovascularization process triggers the progressive replacement of the growing cartilage by bone, in a complex multistep process that involves the coordinated activity of chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, each standing in functional interaction with the vascular system. Studies using genetically modified mice have started to shed light on the molecular regulation of the cartilage neovascularization processes that drive endochondral bone development, growth, and repair, with a prime role being played by vascular endothelial growth factor and its isoforms. The vasculature of bone remains important throughout life as an intrinsic component of the bone and marrow environment. Bone remodeling, the continual renewal of bone by the balanced activities of osteoclasts resorbing packets of bone and osteoblasts building new bone, takes place in close spatial relationship with the vascular system and depends on signals, oxygen, and cellular delivery via the bloodstream. Conversely, the integrity and functionality of the vessel system, including the exchange of blood cells between the hematopoietic marrow and the circulation, rely on a delicate interplay with the cells of bone. Here, the current knowledge on the cellular relationships and molecular crosstalk that coordinate skeletal vascularization in bone development and homeostasis will be reviewed.", "journal": "Calcified tissue international", "date": "2013-01-08", "authors": ["ChristaMaes"], "doi": "10.1007/s00223-012-9689-z"}

Various treatment options including oral propranolol have been described for IH, but the mechanism of drugs remains enigmatic. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis and establish a reliable in vivo model of IH which can provide platform for drug exploration.\nStem cells from the proliferating hemangiomas (HemSCs) were isolated by CD133-tagged immunomagnetic beads. Their phenotype and angiogenic property were investigated by flow cytometry, culturing on Matrigel, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescent staining and injection into BALB/c-nu mice.\nHemSCs had robust ability of proliferating and cloning. The time of cells doubling in proliferative phase was 16 hours. Flow cytometry showed that HemSCs expressed mesenchymal markers CD29, CD44, but not endothelial/hematopoietic marker of CD34 and hematopoietic marker CD45. The expression of CD105 was much lower than that of the reported hemangioma derived or normal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). Real-time PCR showed that the mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) of HemSCs were higher than that of neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). After HemSCs were cultured on Matrigel in vitro, they formed tube-like structure in a short time (16 hours) and differentiated into endothelial cells in 7 days. After 1 - 2 weeks of implantation into immunodeficient mice, HemSCs generated glucose transporter 1 positive blood vessels. When co-injected with HUVECs, the vascularization of HemSCs was greatly enhanced. However, the single implantation of HUVECs hardly formed blood vessels in BALB/c-nu mice (P < 0.05).\nHemSCs may be some kinds of primitive mesoderm derived stem cells with powerful angiogenic ability, which can recapitulate human hemangioma by co-injecting into immunodeficient mice with HUVECs.", "journal": "Chinese medical journal", "date": "2013-01-05", "authors": ["Hua-mingMai", "Jia-weiZheng", "Yan-anWang", "Xiu-juanYang", "QinZhou", "Zhong-pingQin", "Ke-leiLi"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Interplay between adipose tissue and blood vessels in obesity and vascular dysfunction.", "abstract": "There is a close anatomical and functional relationship between adipose tissue and blood vessels. The crosstalk between these two organs is vital to both metabolic and vascular homeostasis. On the one hand, adipose tissue is highly vascularized, and maintenance of ample supply of blood flow is essential for both expansion and metabolic functions of adipose tissue. Vascular endothelium also secretes many factors to regulate adipogenesis and adipose tissue remodeling. On the other hand, almost all blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which regulates vascular function by producing a large number of \"vasocrine\" molecules. Under the normal conditions, PVAT exerts its anti-contractile effects by release of vasorelaxants (such as adipocyte-derived relaxation factors and adiponectin) that promote both endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations of blood vessels. However, PVAT in obesity becomes highly inflamed and induces vascular dysfunction by augmented secretion of vasoconstriction factors (such as the major components of renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system and superoxide) and pro-inflammatory adipokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein), the latter of which are important contributors to endothelial activation, vascular inflammation and neointimal formation. Furthermore, several adipocyte-derived adipokines impair vascular function indirectly, by acting in the brain to activate sympathetic nerve system (such as leptin) or by exerting their actions in major metabolic organs to induce vascular insulin resistance, which in turn aggravates endothelial dysfunction. Aberrant secretion of adipokines and other vasoactive factors in adipose tissue is a major contributor to the onset and progression of obesity-related metabolic and vascular complications.", "journal": "Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders", "date": "2013-01-04", "authors": ["PingGu", "AiminXu"], "doi": "10.1007/s11154-012-9230-8"}

We used ex vivo retinal explants to investigate the role of \u03b23-ARs in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release associated with hypoxia. Whether nitric oxide (NO) mediates \u03b23-AR regulation of VEGF release was also investigated. \u03b23-AR activation was obtained using BRL 37344, whereas SR59230A, L-748,337, or specific siRNAs were used to block \u03b23-ARs. Pharmacological approaches were used to interfere with the NO pathway. Western blot was used to determine \u03b2-AR levels. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure VEGF release. NO production was assessed by a colorimetric assay. We found that hypoxia upregulates \u03b23-ARs. In addition, we observed that \u03b23-AR activation with BRL 37344 increases VEGF release in response to hypoxia. Either \u03b23-AR blocker or \u03b23-AR silencing downregulates drastically hypoxic levels of VEGF. With experiments using NO synthase (NOS) blockade with L-NAME, NOS activation with fluvastatin or NO supplementation with SNAP, we demonstrated that \u03b23-ARs and VEGF are functionally coupled via the NO pathway. In summary, the data presented here support the assumption that \u03b23-ARs are involved in the regulation of angiogenic responses to hypoxia through the NO signalling, a key pathway in hypoxic/ischemic diseases.

Two-photon laser-scanning intravital microscopy (LSIM) allows for real-time, deep tissue, high-resolution imaging in physiological conditions. The recent application of this technology to study organ rejection started to provide a clearer picture of the spatiotemporal immunological dynamics of organ rejection.\nTo date, LSIM has been applied to transplanted skin, islet, and kidney in mice, as well to constantly moving organs such as transplanted lung and heart. To characterize the dynamics of innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration, time-lapse imaging of various fluorescent-reporter mice was performed. Overall, these studies revealed differences between the anatomical location of infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes in various transplanted organs. In addition, the dynamics of lymphocytic infiltration revealed different transendothelial migration routes in vascularized versus nonvascularized transplanted tissues.\nLSIM is a very powerful tool that can be used to carefully dissect the immune cells dynamics in rejection and in tolerance induction in transplantation. Many dynamic biological processes can only be investigated using LSIM.

{"title": "Artificial lymphatic drainage systems for vascularized microfluidic scaffolds.", "abstract": "The formation of a stably perfused microvasculature continues to be a major challenge in tissue engineering. Previous work has suggested the importance of a sufficiently large transmural pressure in maintaining vascular stability and perfusion. Here we show that a system of empty channels that provides a drainage function analogous to that of lymphatic microvasculature in vivo can stabilize vascular adhesion and maintain perfusion rate in dense, hydraulically resistive fibrin scaffolds in vitro. In the absence of drainage, endothelial delamination increased as scaffold density increased from 6 to 30 mg/mL and scaffold hydraulic conductivity decreased by a factor of 20. Single drainage channels exerted only localized vascular stabilization, the extent of which depended on the distance between vessel and drainage as well as scaffold density. Computational modeling of these experiments yielded an estimate of 0.40-1.36 cm H2O for the minimum transmural pressure required for vascular stability. We further designed and constructed fibrin patches (0.8 \u00d7 0.9 cm(2)) that were perfused by a parallel array of vessels and drained by an orthogonal array of drainage channels; only with the drainage did the vessels display long-term stability and perfusion.

We have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), predominantly pericytes, accumulate in muscle (mMSCs) overexpressing the \u03b1(7B)-integrin (MCK:\u03b1(7B); \u03b1(7)Tg) and contribute to new fiber formation following exercise. Since vascularization is a common event that supports tissue remodeling, we hypothesized that the \u03b1(7)-integrin and/or mMSCs may stimulate vessel growth following eccentric exercise. Wild-type (WT) and \u03b1(7)Tg mice were subjected to single or multiple (3 times/wk, 4 wk) bouts of downhill running exercise. Additionally, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) -labeled mMSCs were intramuscularly injected into WT recipients. A subset of recipient mice were run downhill before injection to recapitulate the exercised microenvironment. While total number of CD31(+) vessels declined in both WT and \u03b1(7)Tg muscle following a single bout of exercise, the number of larger CD31(+) vessels with a visible lumen was preferentially increased in \u03b1(7)Tg mice following eccentric exercise training (P < 0.05). mMSC transplantation similarly increased vessel diameter and the total number of neuron-glial antigen-2 (NG2(+)) arterioles postexercise. Secretion of arteriogenic factors from mMSCs in response to mechanical strain, including epidermal growth factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, may account for vessel remodeling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the \u03b1(7)-integrin and mMSCs contribute to increased vessel diameter size and arteriolar density in muscle in response to eccentric exercise.

{"title": "Disruption of thrombospondin-2 accelerates ischemic fracture healing.", "abstract": "Thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) is a matricellular protein that is highly up-regulated during fracture healing. TSP2 negatively regulates vascularity, vascular reperfusion following ischemia, and cutaneous wound healing. As well, TSP2-null mice show increased endocortical bone formation due to an enhanced number of mesenchymal progenitor cells and show increased cortical thickness. Mice deficient in TSP2 (TSP2-null) show an alteration in fracture healing, that is unrelated to their cortical bone phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced vascularization with a shift towards an intramembranous healing phenotype; thus, we hypothesized that there would be enhanced ischemic fracture healing in the absence of TSP2. We investigated whether an absence of TSP2 would enhance ischemic fracture healing utilizing Laser doppler, \u00b5CT and histological analysis. Ischemic tibial fractures were created in wildtype (WT) and TSP2-null mice and harvested 10, 20, or 40 days post-fracture. TSP2-null mice show enhanced vascular perfusion following ischemic fracture. At day 10 post-fracture, TSP2-null mice have 115% greater bone volume than WT mice. This is associated with a 122% increase in vessel density, 20% increase in cell proliferation, and 15% decrease in apoptosis compared to WT. At day 20, TSP2-null mice have 34% more bone volume, 51% greater bone volume fraction, and 37% more bone tissue mineral density than WT.

The main advantage of this technique is the preservation of the labial sphincter, which is vascularized, mobile and sensitive. The aesthetic result is acceptable. This flap keeps the vermilion, but with rounded commissures that corrects spontaneously. The main disadvantage of this flap is the microstomia, requiring only rarely further surgery.\nThe Karapandzic flap is a good option for reconstruction of extensive defects of the lower lip. It recreates the labial sphincter, while maintaining its vascularization and innervation. Functionality is maintained, with an aesthetically acceptable result despite the presence of residual microstomia proportional to the defect.", "journal": "Revue de laryngologie - otologie - rhinologie", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["FEspitalier", "BDr\u00e9no", "OMalard"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Fifteen years later: main lessons from composite tissue allografts.", "abstract": "Composite tissue allografts (CTA) are also called \"reconstructive transplantation\" as they are a valid alternative approach to repairing complex tissue defects. These procedures are still considered \"experimental\" and their therapeutic value remains to be validated. An immunosuppressive treatment similar to that used in solid organ transplantation allows CTA survival and function despite a high rate of acute rejection (AR) episodes. Clinical experience seems to confirm that skin is the most antigenic tissue and the first target of AR episodes, which are easy to reverse and do not seem to adversely influence graft survival and function when promptly treated. Chronic rejection can also occur in CTA, although its features are still unclear. Upper-extremity or face-transplanted patients show a relevant sensorimotor recovery. Patients are able to perform the majority of daily activities and to lead normal social lives. Global cortical remodeling occurs in the months following transplantation, reversing the functional reorganization induced by the amputation. Appropriation of the graft occurs in parallel with functional recovery. The patients' compliance is essential for the success of CTAs as well as careful recipient selection and patient follow-up to prevent complications of long-term immunosuppression.", "journal": "Clinical transplants", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["Jean-MichelDubernard", "AngelaSirigu", "ChristianSeulin", "EmmanuelMorelon", "PalminaPetruzzo"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Exercise benefits brain function: the monoamine connection.", "abstract": "The beneficial effects of exercise on brain function have been demonstrated in animal models and in a growing number of clinical studies on humans.

{"title": "Pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and the wound healing process.", "abstract": "Pericytes are cells that reside on the wall of the blood vessels and their primary function is to maintain the vessel integrity. Recently, it has been realized that pericytes have a much greater role than just the maintenance of vessel integrity essential for the development and formation of a vascular network. Pericytes also have stem cell-like properties and are seemingly able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and granulocytes, leading them to be identified as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). More recently it has been suggested that pericytes play a key role in wound healing, whereas the beneficial effects of MSCs in accelerating the wound healing response has been recognized for some time. In this review, we collate the most recent data on pericytes, particularly their role in vessel formation and how they can affect the wound healing process.", "journal": "Cells", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["Stuart JMills", "Allison JCowin", "PritinderKaur"], "doi": "10.3390/cells2030621\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-1122\n10.1159/000025622\n10.1161/01.RES.80.4.444\n10.1182/blood-2004-01-0336\n10.1006/exer.1993.1166\n10.1016/0026-2862(87)90052-5\n10.1016/S0361-9230(99)00260-9\n10.1215/S1152851705000232\n10.1007/s00441-003-0745-x\n10.1161/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7\n10.1007/BF02593544\n10.1083/jcb.113.1.147\n10.1046/j.1440-1681.2000.03343.x\n10.1083/jcb.110.5.1757\n10.1083/jcb.101.1.43\n10.1016/0026-2862(92)90085-4\n10.1164/ajrccm/140.4.1097\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0177(199709)210:1<66::AID-AJA7>3.0.CO;2-#\n10.1006/dbio.2001.0267\n10.1002/aja.1001810409\n10.1073/pnas.86.12.4544\n10.1083/jcb.105.3.1455\n10.1083/jcb.141.3.805\n10.1016/0014-4800(70)90084-5\n10.1073/pnas.97.6.2626\n10.1006/dbio.1996.0259\n10.1126/science.284.5419.1534\n10.1093/emboj/21.7.1743\n10.1242/dev.01529\n10.1083/jcb.122.1.103\n10.1006/mvre.1999.2208\n10.1016/j.biochi.2012.07.002\n10.1002/ar.22539\n10.3109/08977199309029135\n10.1016/0026-2862(79)90041-4\n10.1016/S0014-4835(88)80025-3\n10.1083/jcb.104.3.483\n10.1038/ki.1986.266\n10.1016/0026-2862(84)90018-9\n10.1084/jem.20051210\n10.1038/nrc1093\n10.1038/35025215\n10.1038/ncb1288\n10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.031\n10.1046/j.1087-0024.2000.00014.x\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000144457.55518.E5\n10.1159/000145577\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.08.008\n10.1111/j.1600-0404.1973.tb01290.x\n10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00024-7\n10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.156372\n10.1161/01.RES.84.3.298\n10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.02.053\n10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06554.x\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0226\n10.1089/ten.2006.0278\n10.1007/s00441-007-0417-3\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001886\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.11.026\n10.4161/org.6.4.12393\n10.1023/A:1026387411627\n10.1016/j.jdermsci.2012.02.002\n10.1016/0026-2862(92)90078-4\n10.2353/ajpath.2006.060196"}

Recently, hydrogels have received a considerable interest as leading candidates for engineered tissue scaffolds due to their unique compositional and structural similarities to the natural extracellular matrix, in addition to their desirable framework for cellular proliferation and survival. More recently, the ability to control the shape, porosity, surface morphology, and size of hydrogel scaffolds has created new opportunities to overcome various challenges in tissue engineering such as vascularization, tissue architecture and simultaneous seeding of multiple cells. This review provides an overview of the different types of hydrogels, the approaches that can be used to fabricate hydrogel matrices with specific features and the recent applications of hydrogels in tissue engineering. Special attention was given to the various design considerations for an efficient hydrogel scaffold in tissue engineering.

However, these images are inherently subject to noise and shadows, which hinders standard segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose to use simultaneously the different information coming from 3D US and CEUS images to address the problem of kidney segmentation. To that end, we introduce a generic framework for joint co-segmentation and registration that seeks objects having the same shape in several images. From this framework, we derive both an ellipsoid co-detection and a model-based co-segmentation algorithm. These methods rely on voxel-classification maps that we estimate using random forests in a structured way. This yields a fast and fully automated pipeline, in which an ellipsoid is first estimated to locate the kidney in both US and CEUS volumes and then deformed to segment it accurately. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art results (by dividing the kidney volume error by two) on a clinically representative database of 64 images.", "journal": "Information processing in medical imaging : proceedings of the ... conference", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["RaphaelPrevost", "RemiCuingnet", "BenoitMory", "Jean-MichelCorreas", "Laurent DCohen", "RobertoArdon"], "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-38868-2_23"}

The investigation included data on patients aged at least 18 years at admission to hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of ACS, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina pectoris in the case histories. The data were introduced from the completed case histories. In the patients with NSTEACS, the risk of hospital and 6-month deaths was calculated using the GRACE scale. In these patients, the risk of bleeding was estimated using the CRUSADE scale.\nHistory data on the presence of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and prior diseases before ACS were collected from 42,000 patients with NSTEACS. The patients' median age was 66 years; males were 60.6% and women were 59.4%. Smokers were 21.7%. 35.1% of the patients with NSTEACS were found to have a family history of early-onset coronary heart disease (CHD). There were a large proportion of patients at high risk for hospital death according to the GRACE scale. In the period 2009-2012, the proportion of patients with NSTEACS at low risk for hospital death decreased from 30.6 to 25.3% and that of patients at high risk for hospital death proportionally increased from 41.2 to 44.9%. Analysis of the risk for 6-month death by the GRACE scale indicated that the proportion of patients at high risk was twice higher than that of patients at low and moderate risks taken together and did not reduce in the analyzed period of time. The patients with NSTEACS at high risk for hospital and 6-month death (2012) amounted to 44.9 and 61.7%, respectively.

Previous studies raise the possibility that a unique derived feature of Homo sapiens is a relatively larger temporal lobe compared to those of other hominins and apes. Such a brain reorganization might have contributed to the evolution of various \"higher\" cognitive functions of Homo sapiens, including language. Hence, the importance of further comparative analyses of the temporal region. With the technique that we developed we were able to study the meninges, the subarachnoidal space and the cortex of the human temporal lobe. The spatial resolution and the ability to visualize structures of 200-300 microm size led us to hypothesize that the linear structures parallel to the subarachnoidal space might be referred to the neuronal layers of the cortex. The low cost, simplicity and safety of the procedure suggest that this technique may have a significant potential in the comparative study of the primate temporal lobe. Furthermore, the procedure described here can also be used for the study of vascularization of the meninges, in order to better understand the evolutionary relationships between the neurocranial shape and the middle meningeal vessels in living and fossil human species.", "journal": "Italian journal of anatomy and embryology = Archivio italiano di anatomia ed embriologia", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["MarcoRuggiero", "StefanoMagherini", "Maria GiuliaFiore", "BrunettoChiarelli", "GabrieleMorucci", "Jacopo Junio ValerioBranca", "MassimoGulisano", "StefaniaPacini"], "doi": null}
{"title": "I. Embryonal vasculature formation recapitulated in transgenic mammary tumor spheroids implanted pseudo-orthotopicly into mouse dorsal skin fold: the organoblasts concept.", "abstract": "Inadequate understanding of cancer biology is a problem. This work focused on cellular mechanisms of tumor vascularization. According to earlier studies, the tumor vasculature derives from host endothelial cells (angiogenesis) or their precursors of bone marrow origin circulating in the blood (neo-vasculogenesis) unlike in embryos. In this study, we observed the neo-vasculature form in multiple ways from local precursor cells. Recapitulation of primitive as well as advanced embryonal stages of vasculature formation followed co-implantation of avascular ( in vitro cultured) N202 breast tumor spheroids and homologous tissue grafts into mouse dorsal skin chambers. Ultrastructural and immunocytochemical analysis of tissue sections exposed the interactions between the tumor and the graft tissue stem cells. It revealed details of vasculature morphogenesis not seen before in either tumors or embryos. A gradual increase in complexity of the vascular morphogenesis at the tumor site reflected a range of steps in ontogenic evolution of the differentiating cells. Malignant- and surgical injury repair-related tissue growth prompted local cells to initiate extramedullar erythropoiesis and vascular patterning. The new findings included: interdependence between the extramedullar hematopoiesis and assembly of new vessels (both from the locally differentiating precursors); nucleo-cytoplasmic conversion (karyolysis) as the mechanism of erythroblast enucleation; the role of megakaryocytes and platelets in vascular pattern formation before emergence of endothelial cells; lineage relationships between hematopoietic and endothelial cells; the role of extracellular calmyrin in tissue morphogenesis; and calmyrite, a new ultrastructural entity associated with anaerobic energy metabolism. The central role of the extramedullar erythropoiesis in the formation of new vasculature (blood and vessels) emerged here as part of the tissue building process including the lymphatic system and nerves, and suggests a cellular mechanism for instigating variable properties of endothelial surfaces in different organs. Those findings are consistent with the organoblasts concept, previously discussed in a study on childhood tumors, and have implications for tissue definition.", "journal": "F1000Research", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["HalinaWitkiewicz", "PhilOh", "Jan ESchnitzer"], "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.2-8.v2\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.016\n10.7861/clinmedicine.3-6-560\n10.1097/MOH.0b013e32832bbcab\n10.1242/dev.02596\n10.1387/ijdb.093039hu\n10.1182/blood-2009-06-226209\n10.1182/blood-2008-09-178863\n10.1126/science.1178331\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1097/00000658-197203000-00014\n10.1126/science.275.5302.964\n10.1073/pnas.0710516105\n10.1016/S0070-2153(07)00001-4\n10.1387/ijdb.093056jp\n10.1038/ni1560\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80355-6\n10.1016/0270-9139(95)90519-7\n10.1590/S0102-86502007000200011\n10.1182/blood-2009-05-219923\n10.1016/j.surneu.2007.02.017\n10.1177/1066896907302534\n10.1083/jcb.33.3.625\n10.1083/jcb.35.1.237\n10.1073/pnas.0900986106\n10.1084/jem.122.3.467\n10.1006/scbi.1998.0119\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64740-2\n10.1159/000057688\n10.1186/jbiol177\n10.1111/j.1525-142X.2009.00393.x\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000447\n10.12688/f1000research.2-9.v2\n10.1006/mvre.1995.1017\n10.1385/1-59259-380-1:65\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4493\n10.1002/1097-0215(20000715)87:2<186::AID-IJC5>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1038/nbt1292\n10.1111/j.1365-2818.1986.tb02772.x\n10.1182/blood-2006-06-031898\n10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07419.x\n10.1016/j.aca.2008.04.061\n10.1007/BF00493157\n10.1083/jcb.120.5.1147\n10.1073/pnas.92.5.1759\n10.1016/0026-2862(75)90040-0\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024\n10.1083/jcb.112.5.781\n10.1182/blood-2009-09-241752\n10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.001\n10.1073/pnas.1016030108\n10.1016/S1074-7613(00)80581-6\n10.1387/ijdb.093040cr\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.09.018\n10.1080/019131299281446\n10.1126/science.283.5401.534\n10.1073/pnas.96.25.14482\n10.1038/43919\n10.1161/01.CIR.0000051460.85800.BB\n10.1634/stemcells.2007-0988\n10.1038/nature02604\n10.1016/j.exphem.2010.04.005\n10.12688/f1000research.2-10.v1\n10.1111/j.1365-4632.2010.04678.x\n10.1371/journal.pone.0011303\n10.1002/stem.100\n10.1242/dev.011767\n10.1006/dbio.1999.9278\n10.1016/0360-3016(92)90840-E\n10.1101/gad.1305405\n10.1093/brain/awq044\n10.1002/1096-9861(20001002)425:4<479::AID-CNE2>3.0.CO;2-3\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.004\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.025\n10.1016/j.stem.2008.07.026\n10.1016/j.brainresbull.2010.09.008\n10.1073/pnas.81.18.5739\n10.1016/0026-2862(85)90028-7\n10.1038/380364a0\n10.1126/science.289.5482.1197\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.18.1.813\n10.1083/jcb.34.1.207"}

This process plays a key role during tumorigenesis because the vascular network within the tumor enables malignant cells to establish distant metastases. Thus, it is not surprising that targeting tumors with angiogenesis-based therapy remains a significant area of preclinical and clinical studies. One of the most prominent factors considered as a promising target in such therapy is the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4). Emerging evidence suggests that blockade of DLL4 in tumors results in excessive but non-productive angiogenesis which affects tumor growth, even in tumors which are insensitive to anti-VEGF therapy. Nevertheless, the careful evaluation of adverse effects on normal organs' physiology in relation to therapeutic doses of DLL4 inhibitors will be critical for advancement of DLL4 blocking agents in clinical practice.", "journal": "Contemporary oncology (Poznan, Poland)", "date": "2013-01-01", "authors": ["MarlenaBrzozowa", "RomualdWojnicz", "Gra\u017cynaKowalczyk-Ziomek", "KrzysztofHelewski"], "doi": "10.5114/wo.2013.35588"}
{"title": "Semaphorin 3A: A new player in bone remodeling.", "abstract": "Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a protein identified originally as a diffusible axonal chemorepellent. Sema3A has multifunctional roles in embryonic development, immune regulation, vascularization, and oncogenesis. Bone remodeling consists of two phases: the removal of mineralized bone by osteoclasts and the formation of new bone by osteoblasts, and plays an essential role in skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis.

Delayed union of the proximal osteotomy site occurred in one patient that was successfully treated with iliac crest bone grafting. One patient developed non-union at the distal osteotomy site which failed to heal with bone grafting and was therefore converted to endoprosthetic replacement, and another patient was converted to rotationplasty at five months post-surgery because of contaminated margins.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound combined with three-dimensional reconstruction in the planning of perforator flaps.\nThe authors retrospectively analyzed the preoperative imaging vascular anatomy provided by contrast-enhanced ultrasound combined with three-dimensional reconstruction in 32 patients undergoing perforator flap reconstruction between 2009 and 2011. The static and dynamic features of any suitable perforator including number of branches, source vessel, running course, blood flow pattern and velocity (peak systolic velocity and resistance index), and its anatomical relationship were assessed preoperatively by the novel navigation imaging. Based on this information, the preferred perforator and the ideal donor site were selected for the flap harvesting. The accuracy of preoperative imaging data was checked during surgery.\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound provided a continuous blood flow signal and a clear and reliable image of perforators, and three-dimensional reconstruction displayed their spatial anatomical relationship and their roots. Consistent with the surgical findings, perforators were identified accurately in all 32 cases with high specificity (100 percent) and sensitivity.\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound with three-dimensional image reconstruction provides valuable preoperative perforator navigation. It detects precisely the perforator's location, its course, and the quality of its blood flow and allows the choice of the preferred perforator and the ideal donor site. Preoperative location of perforators using contrast-enhanced ultrasound with three-dimensional image reconstruction improves flap planning and eases flap harvesting.\nDiagnostic, IV.", "journal": "Plastic and reconstructive surgery", "date": "2012-12-29", "authors": ["WeijieSu", "LinguoLu", "DavideLazzeri", "Yi XinZhang", "DanruWang", "MarcoInnocenti", "YunliangQian", "TommasoAgostini", "L ScottLevin", "CarolineMessmer"], "doi": "10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182729e9e"}

Since a bioscaffold resulting from a large solid organ should have the potential to preserve its three-dimensional architecture and consistency for at least several months in the site of transplantation, evaluating the mechanical properties of the bioscaffold is mandatory before transplantation. In the current study, we compared five different decellularization protocols and also two main decellularization techniques (perfusion vs. diffusion) to decellularize the sheep liver, which is similar to the human liver in terms of size and anatomy. Moreover, we assessed the retaining of vascular network by dye injection and angiography. We also determined the most proper sterilization method by comparing six different sterilization methods. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were assessed by applying tensile strength, suture retention, and compressive strength tests. The perfusion technique showed better results compared to the diffusion technique. The protocol containing ammonium hydroxide and triton X-100 was the most proper decellularization protocol leading to completely decellularized livers along with intact vascular network. Furthermore, we noted that application of streptokinase in washing step facilitates decellularization. Our results also showed that a combination of two sterilization methods is necessary for complete sterilization of a sheep liver and peracetic acid or ethylene oxide+gamma irradiation was associated with the best outcome. Determining the most appropriate decellularization and sterilization method for each organ along with assessing the mechanical properties of the resulting bioscaffold are principal steps before fabricating efficient artificial organs in the foreseeable future.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Fascia redefined: anatomical features and technical relevance in fascial flap surgery.", "abstract": "Fascia has traditionally been thought of as a passive structure that envelops muscles, and the term \"fascia\" was misused and confusing. However, it is now evident that fascia is a dynamic tissue with complex vasculature and innervation. A definition of fascia as an integral tissue has been provided here, highlighting the main features of the superficial and deep fasciae. Wide anatomic variations and site-specific differences in fascial structure are described, coupled with results of our extensive investigations of fascial anatomy. This will enable surgeons to make better decisions on selecting the appropriate fascia in the construction of fascial flaps. The use of the superficial or deep fasciae in the creation of a fascial flap cannot be selected at random, but must be guided by the anatomical features of the different types of fasciae. In particular, we suggest the use of the superficial fascia, such as the parascapular fascio-cutaneous free flap or any cutaneous flap, when a well-vascularized elastic flap, with the capacity to adhere to underlying tissues, is required, and a fascio-cutaneous flap formed by aponeurotic fascia to resurface any tendon or joints exposures. Moreover, the aponeurotic fascia, such as the fascia lata, can be used as a surgical patch if the plastic surgeon requires strong resistance to stress and/or the capacity to glide freely. Finally, the epimysial fascia, such as in the latissimus dorsi flap, can be used with success when used together with the underlying muscles.

A correction for variance from vascularization effects can thus lead to improved group statistics by reducing inter-subject variability. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) as determined in a resting-state scan has been shown to be dependent on vascularization. Here we present a correction method termed RESCALE (REsting-state based SCALing of parameter Estimates) that uses local information to compute a voxel-wise scaling factor based on the correlation structure of fALFF and task activation parameter estimates from within a cube of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 surrounding that voxel. The scaling method was used on a visuo-motor paradigm and resulted in a consistent increase in t-values in all task-activated cortical regions, with increases in peak t-values of 37.0% in the visual cortex and 12.7% in the left motor cortex.

Alternative approaches utilizing anteriorly pedicled flaps have been described which exploit the vascular supply to the anterior septum and lateral nasal wall. The diminutive nature of the anterior septal blood supply has led to the elaboration of a bipedicled anterior septal flap which is capable of reliable reconstruction of both the frontal beak as well as posterior frontal table defects. Similarly anteriorly based inferior turbinate flaps pedicled largely on anterior ethmoid arborizations have been used successfully to reconstruct anterior defects.

The advantage of implant reconstruction post mastectomy is that it avoids an additional donor site with its associated morbidity, which post-mastectomy autologous reconstruction necessitates.

A more clinically relevant approach to perform both BMT and VCA simultaneously was evaluated.\nWistar Furth (RT1A) rats were treated with a short course of immunosuppressive therapy (anti-\u03b1\u03b2-TCR monoclonal antibody, FK-506, and anti-lymphocyte serum). One day before BMT, rats were treated with varying doses of total body irradiation (TBI) followed by transplantation of heterotopic osteomyocutaneous flaps from hindlimbs of August Copenhagen Irish (RT1A) rats.\nEighty percent of rats conditioned with 300 cGy TBI and 40% of rats receiving 400 cGy TBI accepted the VCA. Mixed chimerism was detected in peripheral blood at 1 month after VCA, but chimerism was lost in all transplant recipients by 4 months.

Acceptors of VCA were tolerant of a donor skin graft challenge and no anti-donor antibodies were detectable, suggesting a central deletional mechanism for tolerance. Regulatory T cells (Treg) from spleens of acceptors more potently suppressed lymphocyte proliferation than Treg from rejectors in the presence of donor stimulator cells.\nThese studies suggest that simultaneous BMT and VCA may establish indefinite allograft survival in rats through Treg-mediated suppression and thymic deletion of alloreactive T cells.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2012-12-20", "authors": ["HongXu", "Deborah MRamsey", "ShengliWu", "Larry DBozulic", "Suzanne TIldstad"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0b013e31827899fc"}

DCM was induced in 50 rats by 6 weeks doxorubicin treatment (2.5 mg/kg/week).

Eleven untreated healthy rats served as the control group. Rats were investigated using a Millar catheter for pressure-volume loop recording, and by echocardiography 30 days after operation. Thereafter, the hearts were excised and investigated functionally, histologically, and biochemically. Doxorubicin led to the development of DCM with reduced fractional shortening (FS), reduced dP/dt(max), increased systolic and diastolic LV diameters, and reduced response to dobutamine. In DCM-Sham, these changes were further enhanced, while in DCM-EHT we found improved FS, dP/dt(max), and dobutamine responsiveness. In isolated hearts, electrical multielectrode mapping revealed that EHT was electrically activated synchronously to the recipient heart.

Here, we studied the expression pattern of the transcription factor Sox17 in the vasculature of murine and human tumors and investigated the function of Sox17 during tumor angiogenesis using Sox17 genetic mouse models. Sox17 was specifically expressed in tECs in a heterogeneous pattern; in particular, strong Sox17 expression distinguished tECs with high VEGFR2 expression. Whereas overexpression of Sox17 in tECs promoted tumor angiogenesis and vascular abnormalities, Sox17 deletion in tECs reduced tumor angiogenesis and normalized tumor vessels, inhibiting tumor growth. Tumor vessel normalization by Sox17 deletion was long lasting, improved anticancer drug delivery into tumors, and inhibited tumor metastasis. Sox17 promoted endothelial sprouting behavior and upregulated VEGFR2 expression in a cell-intrinsic manner. Moreover, Sox17 increased the percentage of tumor-associated CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells within tumors. The vascular effects of Sox17 persisted throughout tumor growth.

This is the first study to apply analyser-based X-ray PC imaging in CT mode to provide three-dimensional (3D) images of excised atherosclerotic plaques. The results provide proof of principle for this technique as a promising method for analysis of carotid plaque microstructure. Multiple image radiography CT (MIR-CT), a tomographic implementation of X-ray PC imaging that employs crystal optics, was employed to image excised carotid plaques. MIR-CT imaging yields three complementary images of the plaque's 3D X-ray absorption, refraction and scatter properties. These images were compared with histological sections of the tissue. X-ray PC images were able to identify the interface between the plaque and the medial wall.

{"title": "3D Imaging of vascular networks for biophysical modeling of perfusion distribution within the heart.", "abstract": "One of the main determinants of perfusion distribution within an organ is the structure of its vascular network. Past studies were based on angiography or corrosion casting and lacked quantitative three dimensional, 3D, representation. Based on branching rules and other properties derived from such imaging, 3D vascular tree models were generated which were rather useful for generating and testing hypotheses on perfusion distribution in organs. Progress in advanced computational models for prediction of perfusion distribution has raised the need for more realistic representations of vascular trees with higher resolution. This paper presents an overview of the different methods developed over time for imaging and modeling the structure of vascular networks and perfusion distribution, with a focus on the heart. The strengths and limitations of these different techniques are discussed. Episcopic fluorescent imaging using a cryomicrotome is presently being developed in different laboratories. This technique is discussed in more detail, since it provides high-resolution 3D structural information that is important for the development and validation of biophysical models but also for studying the adaptations of vascular networks to diseases. An added advantage of this method being is the ability to measure local tissue perfusion. Clinically, indices for patient-specific coronary stenosis evaluation derived from vascular networks have been proposed and high-resolution noninvasive methods for perfusion distribution are in development.

Recently, cell therapy using MSCs has been studied as a novel therapeutic approach for cancers that show refractory progress and poor prognosis. MSCs from different tissues have different properties. However, the effect of different MSC properties on their application in anticancer therapies has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, to characterize the anticancer therapeutic application of MSCs from different sources, we established two different kinds of human MSCs: umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCB-MSCs) and adipose-tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs). We used these MSCs in a coculture assay with primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells to analyze how MSCs from different sources can inhibit GBM growth. We found that UCB-MSCs inhibited GBM growth and caused apoptosis, but AT-MSCs promoted GBM growth. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick-end labeling assay clearly demonstrated that UCB-MSCs promoted apoptosis of GBM via tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL was expressed more highly by UCB-MSCs than by AT-MSCs. Higher mRNA expression levels of angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin 1, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor) and stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) were observed in AT-MSCs, and highly vascularized tumors were developed when AT-MSCs and GBM were cotransplanted. Importantly, CXCL12 inhibited TRAIL activation of the apoptotic pathway in GBM, suggesting that AT-MSCs may support GBM development in vivo by at least two distinct mechanisms-promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis. The opposite effects of AT-MSCs and UCB-MSCs on GBM clearly demonstrate that differences must be considered when choosing a stem cell source for safety in clinical application.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2012-12-13", "authors": ["KeikoAkimoto", "KenichiKimura", "MasumiNagano", "ShingoTakano", "GeorginaTo'a Salazar", "ToshiharuYamashita", "OsamuOhneda"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2012.0486"}

Previous studies have demonstrated that physical environments and mechanical force can influence MSC fate, indicating that these factors may be favorable inducers for clinical treatment. Our previous study found that MSCs are spread with a spindle shape when cultured in normal gravity (NG), and under modeled microgravity (MMG) for 72\u00a0h, they become unspread and round and their cytoskeleton fibers are reorganized. These morphological changes affected the function of MSCs through the activity of RhoA. We examined the responses of MSCs under MMG stimulation, followed with VEGF differentiation. We found that MSCs under MMG for 72\u00a0h were differentiated into endothelial-like cells by detecting the expression of endothelial-specific molecules (Flk-1 and vWF), which were also able to form a capillary network. Their endothelial differentiation potential was improved under MMG compared with that under NG. We believe that this method is a novel choice of MMG stimulation for neovascularization. This phenomenon may increase the potential of MSC differentiation, which might be a new strategy for the treatment of various vascular diseases and improve vascularization in tissue engineering.", "journal": "Die Naturwissenschaften", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["XiaofengZhang", "YayunNan", "HuanWang", "JunChen", "NandingWang", "JuanXie", "JingMa", "ZongrenWang"], "doi": "10.1007/s00114-012-1002-5"}

As in other solid tumors, populations of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) endowed with tumor initiating and therapeutic resistance properties have been identified. Glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors resulting in a rich dialog between GSCs and endothelial cells. In one direction, endothelial cells and their secreted proteins are able to sustain GSC properties while, in turn, GSCs can promote neoangiogenesis, modulate endothelial cell functions and may even transdifferentiate into endothelial cells. Accordingly, targeting tumor vasculature seems a promising issue despite incomplete and transient results obtained from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapeutic trials. Recent findings of novel GSC-secreted molecules with pro-angiogenic properties (Semaphorin 3A, hepatoma-derived growth factor) open the path to the design of a concerted attack of glioblastoma vasculature that could overcome the development of resistance to single-targeted therapies while keeping away the toxicity of the treatments.", "journal": "Proteomics.

Sphingolipidomic analysis detected erythrocyte and plasma S1P as well as high plasma ceramides and sphingosine. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of s1pr1 causes global and pericardial edema, loss of blood circulation, and vascular defects characterized by both reduced vascularization in intersegmental vessels, decreased proliferation of intersegmental and axial vessels, and hypersprouting in the caudal vein plexus. The s1pr2 gene was previously characterized as a regulator of cell migration and heart development, but its role in angiogenesis is not known. However, when expression of both s1pr1 and s1pr2 is suppressed, severely reduced vascular development of the intersegmental vessels was observed with doses of the s1pr1 morpholino that alone did not cause any discernible vascular defects, suggesting that s1pr1 and s1pr2 function cooperatively to regulate vascular development in zebrafish. Similarly, the S1P transporter, spns2, also cooperated with s1pr1.

{"title": "Mechanisms of vessel regression: toward an understanding of the resolution of angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Physiological angiogenesis refers to a naturally occurring process of blood vessel growth and regression, and it occurs as an integral component of tissue repair and regeneration. During wound healing, sprouting and branching results in an extensive yet immature and leaky neovascular network that ultimately resolves by systematic pruning of extraneous vessels to yield a stable, well-perfused vascular network ideally suited to maintain tissue homeostasis. While the molecular mechanisms of blood vessel growth have been explored in numerous cell and animal models in remarkable detail, the endogenous factors that prevent further angiogenesis and control vessel regression have not received much attention and are largely unknown. In this review, we introduce the relevant literature from various disciplines to fill the gaps in the current limited understanding of the major molecular and biomechanical inducers of vascular regression. The processes are described in the context of endothelial cell biology during wound healing: hypoxia-driven activation and sprouting followed by apoptosis or maturation of cells comprising the vasculature. We discuss and integrate the likely roles of a variety of endogenous factors, including oxygen availability, vessel perfusion and shear stress, intracellular negative feedback mechanisms (Spry2, vasohibin), soluble cytokines (CXCL10), matrix-binding proteins (TSP, PEDF), protein cleavage products (angiostatin, vasostatin), matrix-derived anti-angiogenic peptides (endostatin, arresten, canstatin, tumstatin), and the biomechanical properties of remodeling the extra-cellular matrix itself. These factors aid in the spatio-temporal control of blood vessel pruning by inducing specific anti-angiogenic signaling pathways in activated endothelial cells, pathways which compete with pro-angiogenic and maturation signals in the resolving wound. Gaining more insight into these mechanisms is bound to shed light on unresolved questions regarding scar formation, tissue regeneration, and increase our understanding of the many diseases with angiogenic phenotypes, especially cancer.", "journal": "Current topics in microbiology and immunology", "date": "2012-12-12", "authors": ["Mateusz SWietecha", "Wendy LCerny", "Luisa ADiPietro"], "doi": "10.1007/82_2012_287"}

We used PCR and direct sequencing to identify mutation of the coding regions of the KRT3 and KRT12 genes.\nCases had an unusually severe phenotype with large numbers of intraepithelial cysts present from infancy and they developed subepithelial fibrosis in the second to third decade. In some individuals, the cornea became superficially vascularized, a change accompanied by the loss of clinically obvious epithelial cysts. Visual loss from amblyopia or corneal opacity was common and four individuals were visually impaired (\u22646/24 bilaterally) and one was blind (<6/60 bilaterally). In all affected family members, there was a heterozygous missense mutation c. 395T>C (p. L132P) in exon 1 of the KRT12 gene, which codes for the helix-initiation motif of the K12 polypeptide. This sequence change was not found in unaffected family members or in 100 unaffected controls.\nThe Leu132Pro missense mutation is within the helix-initiation motif of the keratin and is predicted to result in a significant structural change of the K12 protein.

{"title": "The effect of interstitial pressure on tumor growth: coupling with the blood and lymphatic vascular systems.", "abstract": "The flow of interstitial fluid and the associated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in solid tumors and surrounding host tissues have been identified as critical elements in cancer growth and vascularization. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that tumors may present elevated IFP, which can be a formidable physical barrier for delivery of cell nutrients and small molecules into the tumor. Elevated IFP may also exacerbate gradients of biochemical signals such as angiogenic factors released by tumors into the surrounding tissues. These studies have helped to understand both biochemical signaling and treatment prognosis. Building upon previous work, here we develop a vascular tumor growth model by coupling a continuous growth model with a discrete angiogenesis model. We include fluid/oxygen extravasation as well as a continuous lymphatic field, and study the micro-environmental fluid dynamics and their effect on tumor growth by accounting for blood flow, transcapillary fluid flux, interstitial fluid flow, and lymphatic drainage. We thus elucidate further the non-trivial relationship between the key elements contributing to the effects of interstitial pressure in solid tumors. In particular, we study the effect of IFP on oxygen extravasation and show that small blood/lymphatic vessel resistance and collapse may contribute to lower transcapillary fluid/oxygen flux, thus decreasing the rate of tumor growth. We also investigate the effect of tumor vascular pathologies, including elevated vascular and interstitial hydraulic conductivities inside the tumor as well as diminished osmotic pressure differences, on the fluid flow across the tumor capillary bed, the lymphatic drainage, and the IFP. Our results reveal that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity together with poor lymphatic function is the root cause of the development of plateau profiles of the IFP in the tumor, which have been observed in experiments, and contributes to a more uniform distribution of oxygen, solid tumor pressure and a broad-based collapse of the tumor lymphatics. We also find that the rate that IFF is fluxed into the lymphatics and host tissue is largely controlled by an elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity in the tumor. We discuss the implications of these results on microenvironmental transport barriers, and the tumor invasive and metastatic potential.

A combination of cells, scaffold materials, engineering methods, and biochemical and physiological factors is employed to generate the desired tissue substitute. Scaffolds often play a pivotal role in the engineering process supporting a three-dimensional tissue formation. The ideal scaffold should mimic the native extracellular environment providing mechanical and biological properties to allow cell attachment, migration, and differentiation, as well as remodeling by the host organism. The scaffold should be nonimmunogenic and should ideally be resorbed by the host over time, leaving behind only the regenerated tissue. More than 40 years ago, a preparation of the small intestine was introduced for the replacement of vascular structures. Since then the small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has gained a lot of interest in TE and subsequent clinical applications, as this material exhibits key features of a highly supportive scaffold. This review will focus on the general properties of the SIS and its applications in therapeutical approaches as well as in generating tissue substitutes in vitro. Furthermore, the main problem of TE, which is the insufficient nourishment of cells within three-dimensional, artificial tissues exceeding certain dimensions is addressed. To solve this issue the implementation of another small intestine-derived preparation, the biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM), could be a feasible option.

We investigated two-dimensional (2D) expansion, differentiation and characterization of primary osteoblasts as steps toward the establishment of 3D multicellular spheroids. Supplementation of cell culture medium with vitamin D(3) induces the osteocalcin expression of osteoblasts. An increased osteocalcin concentration of 10.8 \u00b1 0.58 ng/ml could be measured after 19 days in supplemented medium. Vitamin D(3) has no influence on the expression of alkaline phosphatase or the deposition of calcium. Expression of these additional osteogenic markers requires addition of a cocktail of osteogenic factors that, conversely, have no influence on the expression of osteocalcin. Supplementation of the cell culture medium with both vitamin D(3) and a cocktail of osteogenic factors is recommended to produce an osteoblast phenotype that secretes osteocalcin, expresses alkaline phosphatase and deposits calcium.

Ultimately, these cells form the vascularized YS that functions in nutrient transfer to the embryo. How and when EECs, with their apical aspect directly contacting the oocytic yolk, acquire the ability to take up yolk macromolecules during the vitellina-to-vasculosa transition has not been investigated. In addressing these questions, we found that with progressive vascularization, the expression level in EECs of the nutrient receptor triad, LRP2-cubilin-amnionless, changes significantly. The receptor complex, competent for uptake of yolk proteins, is produced by EECs in the area vasculosa but not in the area vitellina. Yolk components endocytosed by LRP2-cubilin-amnionless, preformed and newly formed lipid droplets, and yolk-derived very low density lipoprotein, shown to be efficiently endocytosed and lysosomally processed by EECs, probably provide substrates for resynthesis and secretion of nutrients, such as lipoproteins. In fact, as directly demonstrated by pulse-chase experiments, EECs in the vascularized, but not in the avascular, region efficiently produce and secrete lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apoB, and/or apoA-V. In contrast, perilipin 2, a lipid droplet-stabilizing protein, is produced exclusively by the EECs of the area vitellina.

Hepatic arterial hemorrhage in presence of pancreatitis and peritonitis is a particular challenge is if a standard therapeutic option is not possible.\nThe management of five patients with massive bleeding from the common hepatic artery is described. All patients underwent a splenic artery switch. The splenic artery was dissected close to the splenic hilum and transposed end-to-end to the common hepatic artery after resection of the eroded part. Patients' medical records, radiology reports, and images were reviewed retrospectively. Technical success was defined as immediate cessation of hemorrhage and preserved liver vascularization. Clinical success was defined as hemodynamic stability and adequate long-term liver function.\nTotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed in four of the five cases. Hemodynamic stability and good liver perfusion was achieved in these patients.\nSplenic artery switch is an effective, safe procedure for revascularization of the liver in case of hepatic arterial hemorrhage following pancreatic surgery, pancreatitis, and/or peritonitis. The technique is a promising option if a standard procedure-e.g., stent implantation, embolization and surgical repair with alloplastic prosthesis or autologous venous interposition graft-is not possible.", "journal": "World journal of surgery", "date": "2012-12-04", "authors": ["FKr\u00f6pil", "MSchauer", "MKrausch", "PKr\u00f6pil", "S ATopp", "A MRaffel", "C FEisenberger", "Wolfram TKnoefel"], "doi": "10.1007/s00268-012-1859-7"}

Furthermore, compared to other bioactive lipids, C1P more potently chemoattracted human umbilical vein endothelial cells and stimulated tube formation by these cells. C1P also promoted in vivo vascularization of Matrigel implants and stimulated secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 from BM-derived fibroblasts.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of improving retinal vasculature in an animal model of retinopathy by activating Wnt-signaling.\nC57BL/6J mice were evaluated using a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Test animals were divided in three groups and treated at postnatal day (P) 14 with intravitreal injections of Wnt-signaling modulators (respectively, norrin, Dickkopf-related protein 1 [DKK1], and norrin + DKK1) in one eye. A fourth group of animals were treated with injection of PBS in one eye as well and used as a control group. Areas of avascular retina and neovascular tufts in injected (treated) eyes and noninjected fellow eyes were determined in each of the four groups at P17 (3 days after intravitreal injection) and the difference related to these characteristics was obtained among them. To evaluate the effect of norrin on progression of retinopathy, a fifth litter (eight animals) was also treated with norrin and these retinas were evaluated at different time points.\nModulation of Wnt-signaling consistently shows a statistically significant decrease in the avascular area of the retinas. Treatment with norrin (Wnt-signaling activator) or DKK1 (canonical signaling inhibitor) results in a statistically significant reduction of retinal avascular area compared with control eyes.

Tumor resection represents the only potential cure. In cases of unresectable disease systemic chemotherapy (sCHT) remains the therapy of choice. Modern sCHT regimens including biological agents can induce tumor response that leads to curative surgery of initially unresectable mCRC. However, liver-directed therapy via hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) may produce higher response rates than sCHT. Herein we studied whether a HAI of cetuximab (CE) plus bevacizumab (BE) with or without oxaliplatin (OX) can inhibit tumor growth in a rat model. WAG/Rij rats underwent subcapsular hepatic tumor implantation. After 10\u00a0days animals received either HAI or sCHT of CE plus BE, OX or all three drugs. Saline-treated animals served as controls. Tumor growth was estimated at day 10 and 13. On day 13 liver and tumor tissue was studied histologically and immunohistochemically. In controls the tumors grew about 50\u00a0%. OX alone was not capable of inhibiting tumor growth. In contrast, CE plus BE given as HAI significantly reduced tumor growth compared to sCHT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). HAI of CE plus BE combined with OX yielded an even more pronounced inhibition of tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.

{"title": "Development of the pectoral perforator flap and the deltopectoral perforator flap pedicled with the pectoralis major muscle flap.", "abstract": "Because thinning of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is impossible due to blood circulation, it is difficult to produce thin flaps. Although the pectoral flap and the deltopectoral flap are the best flaps that provide a highly desirable color-texture match to facial skin, their reach is restricted and they require resection in 2 stages. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new method of elevating a flap and to resolve these problems.\nFirst, include the third intercostal perforating branch of the internal thoracic artery in the skin paddle and, outward therefrom, design a skin paddle of the pectoral flap in accordance with the shape of the defect. After a skin incision along the design, elevate the pectoral flap pedicled with the third intercostal perforating branch. Then, after cutting the third intercostal perforating branch at the lower surface of the pectoralis major muscle, harvest the approximately 5- to 6-cm-wide pectoralis major muscle in the lateral direction. In doing so, it is important to include in the harvested muscle body of the pectoralis major muscle the muscular branch of the third intercostal perforating branch, the branch of thoracoacromial artery, as well as the true anastomosis of both. Thereafter, elevate the entire flap, with the thoracoacromial artery for vascularization, and move it to the head and neck region via the subclavian route. In this way, the pectoral perforator flap pedicled with the pectoralis major muscle flap (PP flap) is elevated. As for the deltopectoral perforator flap with the pectoralis major muscle flap (DPP flap), after elevating the deltopectoral flap pedicled with both the second and third intercostal perforating branches of the internal thoracic artery, carry out the same flap elevation operations.\nThe PP flap was used in 4 cases and the DPP flap was used in 1 case. In all cases, the flaps were completely grafted and quite satisfactory, functional, as well as demonstrating good cosmetic results.\nUnlike the conventional pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, the PP flap does not contain in its skin paddle the pectoralis major muscle and the mammary gland, making it possible to produce a thin flap. In addition, the development of this method has now substantially extended the reach of the flap, thereby making it possible for the PP flap to reach the oropharyngeal region and for the DPP flap to reach the frontal region at a single time. Originally, the skin over the precordium is relatively thin and flexible and provides a desirable color-texture match to facial and neck skin; therefore, it is believed that this method may serve as an extremely useful means in the future in the functional and cosmetic reconstruction of the head and neck region.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2012-11-29", "authors": ["YukikoNishi", "HideakiRikimaru", "KensukeKiyokawa", "KoichiWatanabe", "NoriyukiKoga", "AritakaSakamoto"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e3182503c5d"}

Bioactive glass foam scaffolds are known to have osteogenic potential and suitable pore networks for bone regeneration. Degradation of the scaffolds is known to be initially solution mediated, but for effective bone regeneration, remodelling of the scaffold by osteoclasts and vascularisation of the scaffold is necessary. The culture of C7 macrophages on a bioactive glass scaffold induces the cells to differentiate into (TRAP(+ve) ) osteoclasts. They then form distinctive resorption pits within 3 weeks, while MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts deposit mineralized osteoid on their surfaces in co-culture.

The release of soluble silica and calcium ions from 70S30C scaffolds induces an increase in osteoblast numbers as determined via the MTT assay. Scaffolds also support growth of endothelial cells on their surface and tube formation (characteristic of functional microvasculature) following 4 days in culture.

In this work, different TE elements, aiming at bone TE applications, were assembled and its effect on the expression of several vascularization/angiogenesis mediators analyzed. Starch/polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds, obtained by two different methodologies, were combined with fibrin sealant (Baxter(\u00ae)), human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), and growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] or fibroblast growth factor-2 [FGF-2]), and implanted in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2)-luc transgenic mice. The expression of VEGFR2 along the implantation of the designed constructs was followed using a luminescence device (Xenogen(\u00ae)) and after 2 weeks, the explants were retrieved to perform histological analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for vascularization (VEGF and VEGFR1) and inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4, and interferon-gamma) markers. It was showed that SPCL scaffolds obtained by wet spinning and by fiber bonding constitute an adequate support for hASCs. The assembled TE constructs composed by fibrin sealant, hASCs, VEGF, and FGF-2 induce only a mild inflammatory reaction after 2 weeks of implantation. Additionally, the release of VEGF and FGF-2 from the constructs enhanced the expression of VEGFR2 and other important mediators in neovascularization (VEGF and VEGFR1).

In this study, we investigated the potential of targeting the catalytic class I(A) PI3K isoforms in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is the most aggressive of all lung cancer types.\nThe expression of PI3K isoforms in patient specimens was analyzed. The effects on SCLC cell survival and downstream signaling were determined following PI3K isoform inhibition by selective inhibitors or downregulation by siRNA.\nOverexpression of the PI3K isoforms p110-\u03b1 and p110-\u03b2 and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was shown by immunohistochemistry in primary SCLC tissue samples. Targeting the PI3K p110-\u03b1 with RNA interference or selective pharmacologic inhibitors resulted in strongly affected cell proliferation of SCLC cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas targeting p110-\u03b2 was less effective. Inhibition of p110-\u03b1 also resulted in increased apoptosis and autophagy, which was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of Akt and components of the mTOR pathway, such as the ribosomal S6 protein, and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. A DNA microarray analysis revealed that p110-\u03b1 inhibition profoundly affected the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.

Using SAMR1 mice as controls, here we explored the effects of 6 months of voluntary wheel running in 10-month-old female SAMP8 mice. Exercise in SAMP8 mice improved phenotypic features associated with premature aging (i.e., skin color and body tremor) and enhanced vascularization and BDNF gene expression in the hippocampus compared with controls. With the aim of identifying genes involved in brain aging responsive to long-term exercise, we performed whole genome microarray studies in hippocampus from sedentary SAMP8 (P8sed), SAMR1 (R1sed), and exercised SAMP8 (P8run) mice. The genes differentially expressed in P8sed versus R1sed were considered as putative aging markers (i) and those differentially expressed in P8run versus P8sed were considered as genes modulated by exercise (ii). Genes differentially expressed in both comparisons (i and ii) were considered as putative aging genes responsive to physical exercise. We identified 34 genes which met both criteria.

{"title": "VEGF in tumor progression and targeted therapy.", "abstract": "Progression of solid tumors depends on vascularization and angiogenesis in a malignant tissue. Among a whole range of proangiogenic factors, a vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) plays a key role. Blockade of VEGF may lead to regression of vascular network and inhibition of a tumor growth. In the present time, bevacizumab has been introduced into wide clinical practice in therapy of breast cancer, colorectal cancer and recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Coadministration of antiangiogenic therapy with irinotecan may increase probability of the response to the treatment and prolong progression-free survival rate (PFS). Moreover, bevacizumab is well tolerated and significantly improves patient's quality of life. However, in the case of brain tumors, the efficiency of such an approach is controversial. The antiangiogenic therapy can slightly delay tumor growth and does not lead to complete recovery. In addition, it contributes to enhanced tumor cell invasion into the normal brain. The mechanisms of resistance include activation of alternative proangiogenic signaling pathways, of an invasive population of tumor cells, metabolic change toward glycolysis and recruitment of myeloid bone marrow-derived cells to tumors. Obviously, that anti-VEGF therapy as monotherapy was not effective against HGGs. To enhance the antitumor treatment efficacy, it is necessary to develop a multi-target strategy to inhibit critical processes in malignancy progression such as angiogenesis, invasion, autophagy, metastatic spread, recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells and tumor stem-like cells.

{"title": "Haemodynamic influences on kidney oxygenation: clinical implications of integrative physiology.", "abstract": "Renal blood flow, local tissue perfusion and blood oxygen content are the major determinants of oxygen delivery to kidney tissue. Arterial pressure and segmental vascular resistance influence kidney oxygen consumption through effects on glomerular filtration rate and sodium reabsorption. Diffusive shunting of oxygen from arteries to veins in the cortex and from descending to ascending vasa recta in the medulla limits oxygen delivery to renal tissue. Oxygen shunting depends on the vascular network, renal haemodynamics and kidney oxygen consumption. Consequently, the impact of changes in renal haemodynamics on tissue oxygenation cannot necessarily be predicted intuitively and, instead, requires the integrative approach offered by computational modelling and multiple measuring modalities. Tissue hypoxia is a hallmark of acute kidney injury (AKI) arising from multiple initiating insults, including ischaemia-reperfusion injury, radiocontrast administration, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, shock and sepsis. Its pathophysiology is defined by inflammation and/or ischaemia resulting in alterations in renal tissue oxygenation, nitric oxide bioavailability and oxygen radical homeostasis. This sequence of events appears to cause renal microcirculatory dysfunction, which may then be exacerbated by the inappropriate use of therapies common in peri-operative medicine, such as fluid resuscitation. The development of new ways to prevent and treat AKI requires an integrative approach that considers not just the molecular mechanisms underlying failure of filtration and tissue damage, but also the contribution of haemodynamic factors that determine kidney oxygenation. The development of bedside monitors allowing continuous surveillance of renal haemodynamics, oxygenation and function should facilitate better prevention, detection and treatment of AKI.", "journal": "Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology", "date": "2012-11-22", "authors": ["Roger GEvans", "CanInce", "Jaap AJoles", "David WSmith", "Clive NMay", "Paul MO'Connor", "Bruce SGardiner"], "doi": "10.1111/1440-1681.12031"}

All patients presented with severe dorsal curvature and short urethra. First stage included penile disassembly technique with complete separation of corporal bodies, urethral dissection, and transposition and subtotal glans mobilization. Residual dorsal curvature was corrected by tunical incision and grafting of the defect. Short urethra was dissected and transposed ventrally with opening at the base of the penis. Penile entities were reassembled in normal anatomical relationship. Penile body was covered using available vascularized skin flaps. After 6 months, second stage was performed and included reconstruction of the penile urethra using buccal mucosa graft and scrotal hairless skin flap.\nFollow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months (mean 33 months).

{"title": "Thyroid nodules in pediatrics: which ones can be left alone, which ones must be investigated, when and how.", "abstract": "Thyroid nodules are less frequent in childhood than in adulthood, but are more often malignant. Recent estimates suggest that up to 25% of thyroid nodules in children are malignant, therefore, a more aggressive approach is recommended. In this review, we suggest an approach based on a first-step clinical, laboratory, and sonographic evaluation. A history of irradiation of the neck, cranium or upper thorax, previous thyroid diseases or thyroid neoplasms in the family should alert clinicians as being associated with a greater likelihood of malignant nodules. Signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism and dysmorphic features should be carefully considered during the physical examination. Palpable firm lymph nodes, found in some 70% of cases, are the most significant clinical finding in children with malignant nodules. Although the routine determination of calcitonin levels is not uniformly practiced, it can help recognize sporadic or familial medullary thyroid neoplasms. Blood thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and free triiodothyronine determinations (the latter in case of symptoms of hyperthyroidism) are aimed at identifying the few hyperthyroid patients, for whom the next step should be scintiscan. Hyperthyroid patients usually disclose an increased uptake, and a diagnosis of toxic adenoma is commonly made. Cases with normal thyroid function or hypothyroidism (which is usually subclinical) should be evaluated by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). In eu/hypo-thyroid patients, scintiscan provides poor diagnostic information and should not be routinely employed. Thyroid ultrasonography is used to select cases for FNAB. Although ultrasound cannot reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions, it does provide an index of suspicion. Sonographic features that increase the likelihood of malignancy are microcalcifications, lymph node alterations, nodule growth under levothyroxine treatment, and increased intranodular vascularization demonstrated by color Doppler. There is growing evidence that elastography may provide further information on nodule characteristics. FNAB is indicated in all cases with a likelihood of malignancy. FNAB has a diagnostic accuracy of approximately 90% and is used in selection of patients which require surgery. Recently, histological markers and elastography have been introduced to increase the specificity of FNAB and ultrasound, respectively. The pitfall in FNAB cytology is the follicular cytology, in which it is not possible to distinguish between adenoma and carcinoma and therefore thyroidectomy is advised.", "journal": "Journal of clinical research in pediatric endocrinology", "date": "2012-11-21", "authors": ["AndreaCorrias", "AlessandroMussa"], "doi": "10.4274/jcrpe.853"}

In contrast, Egr-1 overexpression appeared to make tumour cells more susceptible to GD-induced necrosis. Finally, Egr-1 shRNA suppressed the growth of MTSs.

{"title": "The acellular myocardial flap: a novel extracellular matrix scaffold enriched with patent microvascular networks and biocompatible cell niches.", "abstract": "There is a great need for acellular, fully vascularized, and biocompatible myocardial scaffolds that provide agreeable biological, nutritional, and biomechanical niches for reseeded cells for in vitro and in vivo applications. We generated myocardial flap scaffolds comprising porcine left-anterior ventricular myocardium and its associated coronary arteries and veins and investigated the combinatorial effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) perfusion on both the myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) and the vascular ECM. Results showed that all scaffolds displayed a fully intact and patent vasculature, with arterial burst pressures indistinguishable from native coronary arteries and perfusion to the level of capillaries. Scaffolds were free of cellular proteins and retained collagen and elastin ECM components, exhibited excellent mechanical properties, and were cytocompatible toward relevant seeded cells. SDS perfusion preserved collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin well, but only reduced DNA content by 33%; however, this was further improved by post-SDS nuclease treatments. By comparison, NaOH was very effective in removing cells and eliminated more than 95% of tissue DNA, but also significantly reduced levels of laminin and fibronectin. Such constructs can be readily trimmed to match the size of the infarct and might be able to functionally integrate within host myocardium and be nourished by direct anastomotic connection with the host's own vasculature; they might also be useful as physiologically accurate models for in vitro studies of cardiac physiology and pathology.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Endothelial NO synthase augments fetoplacental blood flow, placental vascularization, and fetal growth in mice.", "abstract": "It is not known whether eNOS deficiency in the mother or the conceptus (ie, placenta and fetus) causes fetal growth restriction in mice lacking the endothelial NO synthase gene (eNOS knockout [KO]). We hypothesized that eNOS sustains fetal growth by maintaining low fetoplacental vascular tone and promoting fetoplacental vascularity and that this is a conceptus effect and is independent of maternal genotype. We found that eNOS deficiency blunted fetal growth, and blunted the normal increase in umbilical blood flow and umbilical venous diameter and the decrease in umbilical arterial Resistance Index in late gestation (14.5-17.5 days) in eNOS KO relative to C57Bl/6J controls. On day 17.5, fetoplacental capillary lobule length and capillary density in vascular corrosion casts were reduced in eNOS KO placentas. Reduced vascularization may be a result of decreased vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and protein expression in eNOS KO placentas at this stage. These factors, combined with significant anemia found in eNOS KO fetuses, would be anticipated to reduce fetal oxygen delivery and contribute to the fetal tissue hypoxia that was detected in the heart, lung, kidney, and liver by immunohistochemistry using pimonidazole. Although maternal eNOS deficiency impairs uteroplacental adaptations to pregnancy, maternal genotype was not a significant factor affecting growth in heterozygous conceptuses. This indicates that fetal growth restriction was primarily caused by conceptus eNOS deficiency. In mice, placental hemodynamic and vascular changes with gestation and growth restriction showed strong parallels with human pregnancy. Thus, the eNOS KO model could provide insights into the pathogenesis of human intrauterine growth restriction.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2012-11-15", "authors": ["ShathiyahKulandavelu", "Kathie JWhiteley", "Shannon ABainbridge", "DaweiQu", "S LeeAdamson"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.112.201996"}

Only a few reports on associated systemic malformations have been published. We herein present a rare manifestation of congenital anterior staphyloma (CAS) combined with amniotic band disruption syndrome (ABS).\nShortly after birth, a massive enlargement of the left eye was observed in a female child. Furthermore, an extensive bilateral congenital cleft lip and cleft alveolar ridge with oblique facial cleft extending into the left medial canthal region, coloboma(s) of the left eyelids, extensive adhesions between lids and eye bulb, as well as circumferential grooves, clubfeet, and terminal transverse defects in both hands and feet were present. Due to severe progression of eye bulb protrusion with thinning of the sclera, enucleation of the left eye was performed at the age of 3 years in order to prevent complications including perforation of the globe and with the aim of improving cosmetic aspects.\nHistopathological examination of the enucleated eye disclosed findings typical of congenital anterior staphyloma, including massive corneal staphylomatic deformation with superficial vascularization and elapsed corneoscleral margin, destruction of Bowman's layer, absence of Descemet's layer, corneal endothelium, and angle structures. The lens was only partially formed, and had mainly dissolved. The neural retina appeared normal. The optic nerve disc revealed a pronounced excavation. Facial clefts, lid colobomas, congenital constriction bands, and amputation of distal limbs match ABS. This malformation complex develops in early pregnancy, probably prior to 35 days post conception.\nThis is the first report on an association of these two rare complex congenital malformations, congenital anterior staphyloma and amniotic band syndrome. The anterior staphyloma was unilateral, and related to facial clefts and lid coloboma in the area adjacent to the anterior staphyloma. Furthermore, the systemic deformities are clearly due to the amniotic bands, and the timing of the development of both complex malformations seems to be similar. All findings suggest that the presence of amniotic bands is a causative factor for all observed abnormalities including anterior staphyloma.", "journal": "Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie", "date": "2012-11-15", "authors": ["CharlotteSchramm", "Jens MRohrbach", "SiegmarReinert", "Ulrike AMau-Holzmann", "SabineAisenbrey", "Karl-UlrichBartz-Schmidt", "DorotheaBesch"], "doi": "10.1007/s00417-012-2197-z"}

Furthermore, inhibition of these molecules individually was demonstrated to have antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects both in vitro and in vivo in several models. In this study, the effect of combining celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, and anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, on the implantation and growth of endometriotic like lesions in a murine model of endometriosis was evaluated. Endometriosis was surgically induced in female BALB/c mice. After 28 days of treatment with celecoxib, anastrozole, or their combination, animals were killed and lesions were counted, measured, excised, and fixed. Immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and CD34 was performed for assessment of cell proliferation and vascularization. TUNEL technique was performed for apoptosis evaluation. Celecoxib was the only treatment to significantly reduce the number of lesions established per mouse, their size and vascularized area. In addition, cell proliferation was significantly diminished and apoptosis was significantly enhanced by both individual treatments. When the therapies were combined, they reversed their effects.

{"title": "Regulation of tumor dormancy and role of microenvironment: a mathematical model.", "abstract": "Herein, a mathematical model of a molecular control system for the regulation of secondary tumors is formulated and analyzed to explore how secondary tumors can be controlled by a primary tumor with/without a surgery and the microenvironment. This control system is composed of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), plasmin, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2), latent TGF\u03b2 (LTGF\u03b2), and tumor density. The control of secondary tumors by primary tumors was first modeled by Boushaba, Nilsen-Hamiton and Levine in [46]. The model is based on the idea that the vascularization of a secondary tumor can be suppressed by inhibitors from a larger primary tumor. The emergence of tumors at secondary sites 5-7 cm from a primary site was observed after surgical removal of the primary tumor in silico. The model supports the notion that the fate of secondary tumors after surgery depends on the distance from the primary tumor and the surrounding microenvironment. As such, the primary tumor did not influence the growth of remote secondary tumors, but it could effectively suppress the growth of the secondary tumors if they were too close to the primary tumor, even after it was removed. Thus, the model predicts the emergence of secondary tumors after the excision of the primary tumor when the distance between these tumors is in the \"distance window.\" It also predicts that the growth behaviors of the secondary tumors depend on the local microenvironment. Based on these findings, we propose several treatment options for better clinical outcomes.", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "date": "2012-11-13", "authors": ["YangjinKim", "KhalidBoushaba"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-1445-2_11"}
{"title": "PGC-1\u03b1 regulates normal and pathological angiogenesis in the retina.", "abstract": "Neovascular diseases of the eye are the most common causes of blindness worldwide. The mechanisms underlying pathological neovascularization in the retina remain incompletely understood. PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular metabolism. In skeletal muscle, PGC-1\u03b1 induces VEGFA expression and powerfully promotes angiogenesis, suggesting a similar role in other tissues. This study investigates the role of PGC-1\u03b1 during normal and pathological vascularization in the retina. We show that PGC-1\u03b1 induces the expression of VEGFA in numerous retinal cells, and that PGC-1\u03b1 expression is strongly induced during postnatal retinal development, coincident with VEGFA expression and angiogenesis. PGC-1\u03b1(-/-) mice have a significant reduction of early retinal vascular outgrowth, and reduced density of capillaries and number of main\u00a0arteries and veins as adults. In the oxygen-induced retinopathy model of retinopathy of prematurity, PGC-1\u03b1 expression is dramatically induced in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, suggesting that\u00a0PGC-1\u03b1 drives pathological neovascularization. In support of this, PGC-1\u03b1(-/-) mice subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy had decreased expression of VEGFA and were protected against pathological neovascularization. These results demonstrate that PGC-1\u03b1 regulates VEGFA in the retina and is\u00a0required for normal vessel development and for pathological neovascularization.

Typical matrices with preformed porous 3D structure cannot be applied due to the obvious lack of migratory capacity of cardiomyocytes (CM). We have therefore developed a fully defined in situ hydrogelation system based on alginate (Alg) and hyaluronic acid (HyA), in which their aldehyde and hydrazide-derivatives enable covalent hydrazone cross-linking of polysaccharides in the presence of viable myocytes. By varying degrees of derivatization, concentrations and composition of blends in a modular system, mechanophysical properties of the resulting hydrogels are easily adjustable. The hydrogel allowed for the generation of contractile bioartificial cardiac tissue from CM-enriched neonatal rat heart cells, which resembles native myocardium. A combination of HyA and highly purified human collagen I led to significantly increased active contraction force compared to collagen, only.

The field of tissue engineering has developed several potential therapies for treating MI including injectable acellular hydrogels. These injectable biomaterials can either be synthetic or naturally derived, and have the potential to be delivered minimally invasively.\nThis review covers the different methods of delivery and presents the initial work on the use of injectable biomaterial scaffolds alone to improve cardiac function post-MI. Several naturally derived materials including alginate, collagen, chitosan, decellularized tissues, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, keratin, and Matrigel, as well as a few synthetic materials have shown promise on their own without the addition of therapeutics such as cells or growth factors. These biomaterials can be potentially delivered via endocardial, epicardial, or intracoronary injections and some can even utilize current catheter technology, indicating a potential for avoiding invasive surgical procedures. Once injected into the wall of the heart, these hydrogels create a scaffold that provides biochemical and structural cues, and the ability for cellular infiltration and remodeling of the local environment.\nInjectable biomaterials have several crucial challenges that should be over come to design optimal therapies for MI and heart failure, including optimizing material properties, methods of injection and understanding the mechanisms of action. But, studies in both small and large animals have shown significant improvement in important parameters including wall thickness, vascularization of the ischemic region, left ventricular volumes, and cardiac function.

Through these studies, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms transducing the biomechanical environment is emerging, with prominent and interacting roles recently identified for key network components including transforming growth factor-\u03b2/SMAD, focal adhesion kinase, MRTFs, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways.\nProgress in understanding biomechanical regulation of mesenchymal cell function is leading to novel approaches for improving clinical outcomes in fibrotic diseases and wound healing. These approaches include interventions aimed at modifying the tissue biomechanical environment, and efforts to target mesenchymal cell activation by, and reciprocal interactions with, the mechanical environment.", "journal": "Current opinion in rheumatology", "date": "2012-11-02", "authors": ["Daniel JTschumperlin", "FeiLiu", "Andrew MTager"], "doi": "10.1097/BOR.0b013e32835b13cd"}
{"title": "Induction of tolerance of vascularized composite allografts.", "abstract": "Vascularized composite allotransplantation has become established as a clinical specialty since the first successful hand transplant was performed in 1998. Data now available indicate that hand and face transplants offer patients good functional outcomes and significant improvements in quality of life. Despite the debilitating nature of the injuries treated by such transplants, the defects are generally not life threatening, making it difficult for physicians to recommend life-long immunosuppression that can itself have grave consequences. One potential solution to this dilemma is the induction of immunologic tolerance of the tissue transplants because tolerance would eliminate the need for such immunosuppression. Transplant tolerance may also prevent chronic rejection, a significant source of late graft loss after organ transplantation.Induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism is a robust approach to establishing such transplant tolerance, which recently led to the first clinical application of a tolerance induction protocol for kidney transplantation. In this manuscript, we review the current status of VCA and of research directed toward bringing a tolerance approach to the VCA field. We also discuss the potential clinical significance of these studies and outline the remaining obstacles to introduction of a tolerance induction protocol to clinical practice in hand or face transplantation.", "journal": "Transplantation", "date": "2012-11-02", "authors": ["David ALeonard", "Curtis LCetrulo", "Duncan AMcGrouther", "David HSachs"], "doi": "10.1097/TP.0b013e31826d886d"}

Chest radiograph showed a 5.5 cm well-defined mass in the left upper lung field. CT revealed a well-circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 5.0 cm with a lobulated margin in the left upper lobe. Intratumoral enhancing vasculature was noted in the early phase of dynamic CT. In the delayed phase, persistent and plateau enhancement was seen. The tumor also had consistently unenhanced areas, suggesting the presence of necrosis. Left upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. The pathology specimen contained tubular glands consisting of non-ciliated columnar cells with areas of solid nests of epithelial cells with weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm (morule) mimicking fetal lung tissue. The tumor was moderately vascularized with areas of comedo necrosis; the stroma was relatively scanty. Final pathological diagnosis was WDFA with left hilar lymph node metastasis (stage T2bN1M0).

{"title": "Resolvin D2 prevents secondary thrombosis and necrosis in a mouse burn wound model.", "abstract": "Deep partial thickness burns are subject to delayed necrosis of initially viable tissues surrounding the primary zone of thermally induced coagulation, which results in an expansion of the burn wound, both in area and depth, within 48 hours postburn. Neutrophil sequestration and activation leading to microvascular damage is thought to mediate this secondary tissue damage. Resolvins, a class of endogenous mediators derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to regulate the resolution of inflammation. We hypothesized that exogenous resolvins could mitigate the deleterious impact of the inflammatory response in burn wounds. Using two different mouse burn injury models involving significant partial thickness injuries, we found that a systemically administered single dose of resolvin D2 (RvD2) as low as 25\u2009pg/g bw given within an interval of up to 4 hours postburn effectively prevented thrombosis of the deep dermal vascular network and subsequent dermal necrosis. By preserving the microvascular network, RvD2 enhanced neutrophil access to the dermis, but prevented neutrophil-mediated damage through other anti-inflammatory actions, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and neutrophil platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1.

{"title": "A unique galectin signature in human prostate cancer progression suggests galectin-1 as a key target for treatment of advanced disease.", "abstract": "Galectins, a family of glycan-binding proteins, influence tumor progression by modulating interactions between tumor, endothelial, stromal, and immune cells. Despite considerable progress in identifying the roles of individual galectins in tumor biology, an integrated portrait of the galectin network in different tumor microenvironments is still missing. We undertook this study to analyze the \"galectin signature\" of the human prostate cancer microenvironment with the overarching goal of selecting novel-molecular targets for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. In examining androgen-responsive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and primary tumors representing different stages of the disease, we found that galectin-1 (Gal-1) was the most abundantly expressed galectin in prostate cancer tissue and was markedly upregulated during disease progression. In contrast, all other galectins were expressed at lower levels: Gal-3, -4, -9, and -12 were downregulated during disease evolution, whereas expression of Gal-8 was unchanged. Given the prominent regulation of Gal-1 during prostate cancer progression and its predominant localization at the tumor-vascular interface, we analyzed the potential role of this endogenous lectin in prostate cancer angiogenesis. In human prostate cancer tissue arrays, Gal-1 expression correlated with the presence of blood vessels, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. Silencing Gal-1 in prostate cancer cells reduced tumor vascularization without altering expression of other angiogenesis-related genes. Collectively, our findings identify a dynamically regulated \"galectin-specific signature\" that accompanies disease evolution in prostate cancer, and they highlight a major role for Gal-1 as a tractable target for antiangiogenic therapy in advanced stages of the disease.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2012-10-31", "authors": ["Diego JLaderach", "Lucas DGentilini", "LauraGiribaldi", "Victor CardenasDelgado", "LorenaNugnes", "Diego OCroci", "NaderAl Nakouzi", "PaulaSacca", "GabrielCasas", "OsvaldoMazza", "Margaret AShipp", "ElbaVazquez", "AnneChauchereau", "Jeffery LKutok", "Scott JRodig", "Mar\u00eda TElola", "DanielCompagno", "Gabriel ARabinovich"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1260"}

The use of the vascularized Hadad-Bassagasteguy nasoseptal flap has dramatically reduced the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rate-the veritable Achilles heel of this surgical approach. Benign meningiomas, however, can erode through the nasal mucosa-the very same mucosa that is used to reconstruct the anterior cranial fossa floor. The goal of this study was to describe the presence of meningioma invasion into the mucosa in patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal resection of ventral skull base meningiomas. The implications of this finding are discussed with respect to resection, reconstruction, and recurrence.\nThis is a retrospective review of three patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal complete resection of ventral skull base meningiomas. Surgically excised tissues were processed for routine histopathological analysis.\nA complete resection of the bone, dura, and tumor was performed in all three cases. Both patients with visual deficits improved. The first patient to undergo endoscopic surgical resection developed a CSF leak, but the later two patients with larger tumors did not. Histopathological analysis demonstrated mucosal invasion by World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma in two of the three cases.\nVentral anterior skull base meningiomas can invade through bone into the mucosa. Because the endoscopic endonasal resection of these meningiomas often requires the use of a vascularized nasoseptal flap to minimize CSF leak complications, it is possible that the nasoseptal flap itself may be compromised by tumor tissue.

In particular, fabrication of vasculature in 3D tissue is one of the most important tasks in tissue engineering, because a vascular network is indispensable for almost every tissue in our body. Here, we sandwiched stripe patterned endothelial cells by randomly cultured fibroblast sheets to control the formation of vasculature in the tissue. The endothelial cells left the original pattern and formed a random network between the two sheets, but, where fibroblasts were focally oriented, some endothelial cells changed their orientation to the same direction as the surrounding fibroblasts. Based on this phenomenon, we sandwiched stripe-patterned endothelial cells between parallel-oriented fibroblast sheets to construct a continuous pre-vascular structure. In the tissue, endothelial cells maintained the shape of their original pattern. On the other hand, stripe-patterned endothelial cells that were vertically sandwiched between oriented fibroblast sheets diverged from the original pattern at right angles, so that they were aligned with the surrounding fibroblasts. These data indicates that, 3D design with consideration of cell-to-cell interaction is critical to fabricate a specific 3D tissue structure.

The potential of vasculature formation within tissue-engineered grafts depends on various factors, including an appropriate choice of scaffold and its microarchitectural design for the support of tissue ingrowth and vessel infiltration, vasculogenic potential of cell types and mechanostimulation on cells to enhance cytokine expression. Here, we demonstrated the effect of biomechanical stimulation on vasculogenic and bone-forming capacity of umbilical-cord-blood endothelial progenitor cells (UCB-EPC) and human fetal bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hfMSC) seeded within macroporous scaffolds and cocultured dynamically in a biaxial bioreactor. Dynamically cultured EPC/hfMSC constructs generated greater mineralization and calcium deposition consistently over 14 days of culture (1.7-fold on day 14; p<0.05). However, in vitro vessel formation was not observed as compared to an extensive EPC-vessel network formed under static culture on day 7. Subsequent subcutaneous implantations in NOD/SCID mice showed 1.4-fold higher human:mouse cell chimerism (p<0.001), with a more even cellular distribution throughout the dynamically cultured scaffolds. In addition, there was earlier evidence of vessel infiltration into the scaffold and a trend toward increased ectopic bone formation, suggesting improved efficacy and cellular survival through early vascularization upon biomechanical stimulation.

Numerous types of human cancers have increased levels of AM; however, the functional consequences of this fact have not been characterized. Therefore, we evaluated whether modulating adrenomedullin (Adm) gene dosage within tumor cells affects lymphangiogenesis. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells that overexpress or underexpress Adm were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice, and tumors were evaluated for growth and vascularization. A dosage range from \u223c10 to 200% of wild-type Adm expression did not affect LLC proliferation in vitro or in vivo, nor did it affect angiogenesis. Notably, the dosage of Adm markedly and significantly influenced tumor lymphangiogenesis. Reduced Adm expression in tumors decreased the proliferation of LECs and the number of lymphatic vessels, while elevated tumor Adm expression led to enlarged lymphatic vessels. Moreover, overexpression of Adm in tumors induced sentinel lymph node lymphangiogenesis and led to an increased incidence of Ki67-positive foci within the lung. These data show that tumor-secreted AM is a critical factor for driving both tumor and lymph node lymphangiogenesis. Thus, pharmacological targeting of AM signaling may provide a new avenue for inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis.", "journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "date": "2012-10-27", "authors": ["Natalie OKarpinich", "Daniel OKechele", "Scott TEspenschied", "Helen HWillcockson", "YuriFedoriw", "Kathleen MCaron"], "doi": "10.1096/fj.12-214080"}

Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that over 21 days of encapsulation, fibroblasts continued to express VEGF, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that there was sustained release of VEGF from the Ca-alginate during this period. The scaffold degraded gradually over the 21 days, without reduction in volume. Cells released from the Ca-alginate at 7 and 21 days as a result of scaffold degradation were shown to retain viability, to adhere to fibronectin in a normal manner, and continue to express VEGF, demonstrating their potential to further contribute to maintenance of cardiac function after scaffold degradation.

Both compounds induced reduction in human EEC proliferation (P < 0.05 versus basal) and increased apoptosis (P < 0.05 versus basal) in primary cultures.\nIn vitro studies were only carried out in epithelial cells from human eutopic endometrium.\nThe present findings are promising and will assist the development of novel natural treatments for endometriosis.\nThis study was supported by ANPCYT (PICT 6384 BID 1201 OC-AR) and CONICET (PIP 5471), Argentina.

There are a number of review articles updating the use of VFG to treat the ANFH. None of them applied statistical analysis for combining results from different studies to obtain a quantitative estimate of the overall effect and potential harm of VFG in comparison to other treatment.\nSeveral electronic databases were searched to find studies using VFG to treat ANFH.

Included studies were assessed for methodological bias and estimates of effect were calculated. Potential reasons for heterogeneity were explored.\nThe clinical results of 69.0 % of VFG-treated patients and 25.0 % of non-VFG-treated patients were good to excellent (OR 0.13; p < 0.01).

Although a doubling of median progression-free survival in CCRCC patients treated by targeted therapies has been observed, the fact that tumors escape after anti-VEGF treatment suggests alternative pathways. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a well-established model, which allows in vivo studies of tumor angiogenesis and the testing of anti-angiogenic molecules.

Our study uses both CCRCC cell lines and fresh tumor samples after surgical resection.

Blood vessels are abrogated from the follicle until ovulation, when they invade it to support the developing corpus luteum. Granulosa cells are known to secrete anti-angiogenic factors that shield against premature vascularization; however, their molecular identity is yet to be defined. In this study we address the physiological role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a well-known angiogenic inhibitor, in granulosa cells. We have shown that human and mouse primary granulosa cells express and secrete PEDF, and characterized its hormonal regulation. Stimulation of granulosa cells with increasing doses of estrogen caused a gradual decrease in the PEDF secretion, while stimulation with progesterone caused an abrupt decrease in its secretion. Moreover, We have shown, by time- and dose-response experiments, that the secreted PEDF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were inversely regulated by hCG; namely, PEDF level was nearly undetectable under high doses of hCG, while VEGF level was significantly elevated. The anti-angiogenic nature of the PEDF secreted from granulosa cells was examined by migration, proliferation and tube formation assays in cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Depleting PEDF from primary granulosa cells conditioned media accelerated endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tube formation. Collectively, the dynamic expression of PEDF that inversely portrays VEGF expression may imply its putative role as a physiological negative regulator of follicular angiogenesis.", "journal": "Molecular human reproduction", "date": "2012-10-19", "authors": ["DanaChuderland", "IdoBen-Ami", "RuthKaplan-Kraicer", "HadasGrossman", "AlisaKomsky", "RonitSatchi-Fainaro", "AnatEldar-Boock", "RaphaelRon-El", "RuthShalgi"], "doi": "10.1093/molehr/gas046"}

{"title": "Image data based reconstruction of the midface using a patient-specific implant in combination with a vascularized osteomyocutaneous scapular flap.", "abstract": "Secondary reconstructions in case of complex craniofacial defects of the midface, following radical tumour surgery, often require individualized surgical techniques. To achieve a satisfying functional and aesthetic outcome various anatomical aspects have to be considered such as the architecture of the bony structures as well as the very special shape of the orbit. Bone grafting is particularly challenging under these conditions, and one single graft type can hardly fulfil all anatomical demands. The presented method aims at combining a free microvascular bone graft and a preoperatively planned patient-specific alloplastic implant which takes into account all anatomic requirements as well as a functional rehabilitation including dental restoration.\nBy means of the described treatment approach, complex midfacial defects are reconstructed on the base of preoperative computer-assisted three-dimensional planning, a patient-specific prefabricated implant and a free vascularized bone transplant. A three-dimensional planning platform was used to create a mirror image of the unaffected contralateral side that was superimposed on the defect side referring to a virtual sagittal plane. The planned donor site of the scapula was then virtually matched into an ideal anatomic position considering all functional and aesthetical aspects, including a later implant based prosthodontic rehabilitation. By use of these virtual outlines, an individual titanium implant was manufactured to provide both for midfacial support and a graft fixture in a position, which was close to original. Intraoperative optical navigation was used to assess the accurate position of the implant with special regard to a correct reconstruction of the orbit. An implantologic rehabilitation could be achieved.\nThe technique presented offers an ideal combination of a patient-specific alloplastic implant for the reconstruction of the very demanding orbital anatomy in combination with a scapular flap offering a sufficient bone stock for an implant based prosthodontic rehabilitation.", "journal": "Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery", "date": "2012-10-18", "authors": ["ChristianMertens", "HubertL\u00f6wenheim", "J\u00fcrgenHoffmann"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcms.2012.09.003"}

Designing coculture systems is deemed a helpful method to understand the dynamic interaction of various cells involved in the angiogenesis process. We investigated the juxtacrine and paracrine interaction between 3 different cells, namely rat marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs), rat muscle-derived satellite cells (rSCs), and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (rCMs), and endothelial cells (ECs) during angiogenesis process. In vitro Matrigel angiogenesis assay was performed whereby ECs were monocultured or cocultured with rMSCs, rSCs, and rCMs or their conditioned media (CM). In addition, in vivo Matrigel plug assay for angiogenesis was conducted to assess the angiogenic potential of the rCM-, rMSC-, and rSC-derived CM. Our results demonstrated that the rMSCs, rSCs, and rCMs elongated along the EC tubules, whereas the rMSCs formed tube-like structures with sprouting tip cells, leading to improved angiogenesis in the coculture system. Moreover, the rMSC- and rSC-derived CM significantly improved angiogenesis tube formation on Matrigel, accelerated EC chemotaxis, and increased the arteriolar density, vascularization index, and vascularization flow index in the Matrigel plug in vivo. Western blotting showed that rMSCs secreted a high level of vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and stromal-derived factor-1-alpha. Tie2 is also shed from rMSCs.

However, the role of oxygen in fracture healing has not been fully studied. Here we systematically examine the effects of oxygen tension on fracture healing and test the ability of hyperoxia to rescue healing defects in a mouse model of ischemic fracture healing. Mice with tibia fracture were housed in custom-built gas chambers and groups breathed a constant atmosphere of 13% oxygen (hypoxia), 21% oxygen (normoxia), or 50% oxygen (hyperoxia). The influx of inflammatory cells to the fracture site, stem cell differentiation, tissue vascularization, and fracture healing were analyzed. In addition, the efficacy of hyperoxia (50% oxygen) as a treatment regimen for fracture nonunion was tested. Hypoxic animals had decreased tissue vascularity, decreased bone formation, and delayed callus remodeling. Hyperoxia increased tissue vascularization, altered fracture healing in un-complicated fractures, and improved bone repair in ischemia-induced delayed fracture union. However, neither hypoxia nor hyperoxia significantly altered chondrogenesis or osteogenesis during early stages of fracture healing, and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils was not affected by environmental oxygen after bone injury.

Exposure sessions shorter than 2 h or longer than 3 h had no observable change on the vascular process. In contrast, the magnetic field had no observable change on the YSM vascular network for embryos aged between 72 and 96 h, irrespective of the exposure time.

Native trachea was used as a control, and NDC trachea stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in parallel to decellularization was used as a time-matched control. Decellularization removed most cells, but chondrocytes and DNA remained after 25 cycles. Fibronectin was retained throughout the lamina propria and laminin at basement membranes. DNA accumulation along ECM fibres was seen. A decline in soluble collagen was observed in decellularized tissue. GAG content of cartilage rings was reduced, even in PBS control tissue from 20 cycles onwards (p<0.05), but decellularization caused the greatest loss (p<0.01). Tensile strength declined throughout the process, but was significant only at later time points.

AAT is known to induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and release, as well as protect from proteolytic cleavage of VEGF by elastase, promote viability of endothelial cells, and enhance migration of myocytes. Our aim was to examine whether AAT enhances vasculogenesis toward islet grafts. We employed Matrigel-islet plugs as means to introduce islets in an explantable isolated compartment and examined vessel formation, vessel maturation, and inflammatory profile of explants 9 days after implantation. Also, we examined primary epithelial cell grafts that were prepared from lungs of mice that are transgenic for human AAT. In addition, aortic ring sprouting assay was performed, and HUVEC tube formation assays were studied in the presence of AAT. Our findings indicate that islet grafts exhibit mature vessels in the presence of AAT, as demonstrated by morphology, as well as expression of endothelial CD31, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and von Willebrand factor (vWF).

Aortic ring sprouting was enhanced in AAT-treated cultures and also in cultures that contained primary epithelial cells from human AAT transgenic animals in the absence of added AAT.

The ASB defect was then repaired using the double flap technique with a vascularized PCF from above and augmented with a vascularized NSF from below.\nPostoperatively, there were no complications of CSF leakage, meningitis, or tension pneumocephalus in both patients. After subsequent radiation therapy, the double flap repair remained intact at 2 years postoperatively in both patients.\nThe double flap skull base reconstruction technique provides an additional barrier of vascularized tissue to prevent CSF leakage, meningitis, tension pneumocephalus, and postradiation necrosis.

A current limitation is the intrahepatic portal vein transplant site, which is prone to mechanical stress and inflammation. Transplantation of pancreatic islets into alternative sites is preferable, but challenging, as it may require a three-dimensional vehicle to confer mechanical protection and to confine islets to a well-defined, retrievable space where islet neovascularization can occur. We have fabricated biostable, macroporous scaffolds from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and investigated islet retention and distribution, metabolic function, and glucose-dependent insulin secretion within these scaffolds. Islets from multiple sources, including rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans, were tested in vitro. We observed high islet retention and distribution within PDMS scaffolds, with retention of small islets (< 100 \u00b5m) improved through the postloading addition of fibrin gel. Islets loaded within PDMS scaffolds exhibited viability and function comparable to standard culture conditions when incubated under normal oxygen tensions, but displayed improved viability compared to standard two-dimensional culture controls under low oxygen tensions. In vivo efficacy of scaffolds to support islet grafts was evaluated after transplantation in the omental pouch of chemically induced diabetic syngeneic rats, which promptly achieved normoglycemia. Collectively, these results are promising in that they indicate the potential for transplanting islets into a clinically relevant, extrahepatic site that provides spatial distribution of islets as well as intradevice vascularization.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2012-10-04", "authors": ["EileenPedraza", "Ann-ChristinaBrady", "Christopher AFraker", "R DamarisMolano", "StevenSukert", "Dora MBerman", "Norma SKenyon", "AntonelloPileggi", "CamilloRicordi", "Cherie LStabler"], "doi": "10.3727/096368912X657440"}

{"title": "Signal processing at mammalian carotid body chemoreceptors.", "abstract": "Mammalian carotid bodies are richly vascularized chemosensory organs that sense blood levels of O(2), CO(2)/H(+), and glucose and maintain homeostatic regulation of these levels via the reflex control of ventilation. Carotid bodies consist of innervated clusters of type I (or glomus) cells in intimate association with glial-like type II cells. Carotid bodies make afferent connections with fibers from sensory neurons in the petrosal ganglia and receive efferent inhibitory innervation from parasympathetic neurons located in the carotid sinus and glossopharyngeal nerves. There are synapses between type I (chemosensory) cells and petrosal afferent terminals, as well as between neighboring type I cells. There is a broad array of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and their ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in the carotid body. This allows for complex processing of sensory stimuli (e.g., hypoxia and acid hypercapnia) involving both autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways. This review summarizes and evaluates current knowledge of these pathways and presents an integrated working model on information processing in carotid bodies. Included in this model is a novel hypothesis for a potential role of type II cells as an amplifier for the release of a key excitatory carotid body neurotransmitter, ATP, via P2Y purinoceptors and pannexin-1 channels.", "journal": "Seminars in cell & developmental biology", "date": "2012-10-02", "authors": ["Colin ANurse", "Nikol APiskuric"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcdb.2012.09.006"}

Morphology and density of the fPap and blood vessels' density and morphology at the tip of the tongue were examined using contact endoscopy (CE). EGM thresholds at the chorda tympani area were significantly higher in both men and women \u219060 years of age than in younger individuals. At the soft-palatine area, EGM thresholds were significantly higher in men aged 20-29 years and \u219060 years compared with men of other age groups. In women older than 50 years, thresholds at all 3 areas were significantly higher than in the younger age groups. No significant differences in EGM thresholds between the two sexes at all locations tested were detected. The density of fPap decreased significantly in men aged >50 years and in women aged >60 years compared with younger individuals. Vascular density decreased significantly and vascular morphology worsened at the tip of the tongue in subjects older than 60 years of age compared with younger subjects. The study showed statistically significant differences in EGM thresholds between the right and the left side of the tongue and between the two sexes.

The capture of HIF-1\u03b1 by pVHL is regulated by an oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of a specific conserved prolyl residue. The VHL gene is mutated in the von Hippel-Lindau cancer predisposition syndrome, which is characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors and is associated with constitutively high levels of HIF-1\u03b1. The disturbance of the dynamic coupling between HIF-1\u03b1 and pVHL bearing the commonly found mutation F76del was experimentally confirmed but the mechanism of such complex disruption is still not clear. Performing unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the F76del mutation may enlarge the HIF binding pocket in pVHL and induce the formation of an internal cavity in the hydrophobic core of the \u03b2-domain, which can lead to a partial destabilization of the \u03b2-sheets S1, S4, and S7 and a consequent loss of hydrogen bonds with a conserved recognition motif in HIF. The newly formed cavity has a significant druggability score and may be a suitable target for stabilizing ligands.

In this study, a method is described for generating composite hydrogels in which porous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels serve as scaffolds for mechanical and structural support, and fibrin is loaded within the pores to induce vascularized tissue formation. Porous PEG hydrogels were generated by a salt leaching technique with 100-150-\u03bcm pore size and thrombin (Tb) preloaded within the scaffold. Fibrinogen (Fg) was loaded into pores with varying concentrations and polymerized into fibrin due to the presence of Tb, with loading efficiencies ranging from 79.9% to 82.4%. Fibrin was distributed throughout the entire porous hydrogels, lasted for greater than 20 days, and increased hydrogel mechanical stiffness. A rodent subcutaneous implant model was used to evaluate the influence of fibrin loading on in vivo response. At weeks 1, 2, and 3, all hydrogels had significant tissue invasion, but no difference in the depth of invasion was found with the Fg concentration. Hydrogels with fibrin loading induced more vascularization, with a significantly higher vascular density at 20\u2009mg/mL (week 1) and 40\u2009mg/mL (weeks 2 and 3) Fg concentration compared to hydrogels without fibrin.

The combination of endothelial cells with current TE strategies seems the most promising approach but doubts persist as to which type of endothelial cells to use. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells have been suggested as a possible source of endothelial progenitors. Osteoblasts obtained from human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were co-cultured with the mononuclear fraction of human UCB for 7 and 21 days on carrageenan membranes. The expression of vWF and CD31, and the DiI-AcLDL uptake ability allowed detection of the presence of endothelial and monocytic lineages cells in the co-culture for all culture times. In addition, the molecular expression of CD31 and VE-cadherin increased after 21 days of co-culture. The functionality of the system was assessed after transplantation in nude mice. Although an inflammatory response developed, blood vessels with cells positive for human CD31 were detected around the membranes. Furthermore, the number of blood vessels in the vicinity of the implants increased when cells from the mononuclear fraction of UCB were present in the transplants compared to transplants with only hASC-derived osteoblasts. These results show how endothelial progenitors present in the mononuclear fraction of UCB can be sustained by hASC-derived osteoblast co-culture and contribute to angiogenesis even in an in vivo setting of inflammatory response.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2012-09-22", "authors": ["R PPirraco", "BMelo-Ferreira", "T CSantos", "A MFrias", "A PMarques", "R LReis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2012.09.013"}

Current strategies for bone tissue engineering using a preformed scaffold have not resulted in the expected clinical regeneration due to difficulty in seeding cells into the deep internal space of scaffold, and the inability to inject them in minimally invasive surgeries. In this study, we used the osteoconductive and mechanical properties of nano-scale calcium sulfate (nCS) and the biocompatibility of alginate to develop the injectable nCS/alginate (nCS/A) paste, and characterized the effect of this nCS/A paste loaded with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene-modified rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on bone and blood vessel growth. Our results showed that the nCS/A paste was injectable under small injection forces. The mechanical properties of the nCS/A paste were increased with an increased proportion of alginate. MSCs maintained their viability after the injection, and MSCs and BMP2 gene-modified MSCs in the injectable pastes remained viable, osteodifferentiated, and yielded high alkaline phosphatase activity. By testing the ability of this injectable paste and BMP2-gene-modified MSCs for the repair of critical-sized calvarial bone defects in a rat model, we found that BMP2-gene-modified MSCs in nCS/A (nCS/A+M/B2) showed robust osteogenic activity, which resulted in consistent bone bridging of the bone defects. The vessel density in nCS/A+M/B2 was significantly higher than that in the groups of blank control, nCS/A alone, and nCS/A mixed with MSCs (nCS/A+M). These results indicate that BMP2 promotes MSCs-mediated bone formation and vascularization in nCS/A paste.

It is unknown whether a similar link exists between cancellous bone remodeling and vascularization. Here, we show an association between remodeling sites, capillaries, proliferative cells, and putative osteoblast progenitors. Iliac crest biopsies from normal human individuals were subjected to histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry to identify the respective positions of bone remodeling sites, CD34-positive capillaries, smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive putative osteoblast progenitors, including pericytes, Ki67-positive proliferative cells, and bone remodeling compartment (BRC) canopies. The BRC canopy is a recently described structure separating remodeling sites from the bone marrow, consisting of CD56-positive osteoblasts at an early differentiation stage. We found that bone remodeling sites were associated with a significantly increased presence of capillaries, putative osteoblast progenitors, and proliferative cells in a region within 50\u2009\u00b5m of the bone or the canopy surface. The increases were the highest above eroded surfaces and at the level of the light-microscopically assessed contact of these three entities with the bone or canopy surfaces. Between 51 and 100\u2009\u00b5m, their densities leveled to that found above quiescent surfaces. Electron microscopy asserted the close proximity between BRC canopies and capillaries lined by pericytes. Furthermore, the BRC canopy cells were found to express SMA. These ordered distributions support the existence of an osteogenic-vascular interface in adult human cancellous bone. The organization of this interface fits the current knowledge on the mode of action of vasculature on osteogenesis, and points to the BRC canopy as a central player in this mechanism. We propose a model where initiation of bone remodeling coincides with the induction of proximity of the vasculature to endosteal surfaces, thereby allowing capillary-BRC canopy interactions that activate marrow events, including recruitment of osteoblast progenitors to bone remodeling sites.", "journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "date": "2012-09-20", "authors": ["Helene BjoergKristensen", "Thomas LevinAndersen", "NielsMarcussen", "LarsRolighed", "Jean-MarieDelaisse"], "doi": "10.1002/jbmr.1760"}

Oestrogens improve many aspects of the skin such as skin thickness, vascularization, collagen content and quality. Despite these clinical evidences, the effects of oestrogens on skin at the cellular level need further clarification.\nHaCaT and human fibroblasts were cultured under various conditions with E2 and H2 O2 ; then were subjected to immunofluorescence and western blot analysis.

In this study, we examined the mechanism by which 1,25-D3 modulates key angiogenic growth factors and angiogenic inhibitors. C(2)C(12) myoblasts were incubated with 100 nM 1,25-D3 or placebo for 1, 4 and 10 days. At the end of the respective incubation time, total RNA was isolated for PCR arrays and for qRT-PCR. Total proteins were isolated for Western blots and proteome profiler arrays. The addition of 1,25-D3 to C(2)C(12) myoblasts increased VEGFa and FGF-1: two pro-angiogenic growth factors that promote neo-vascularization and tissue regeneration, and decreased FGF-2 and TIMP-3: two myogenic and/or angiogenic inhibitors. Our previous study demonstrated that 1,25-D3 altered IGF-I/II expression, consistent with the observed changes in VEGFa and FGF-2 expression. These results extend our previous findings and demonstrate the modulation of angiogenesis which may be an additional mechanism by which 1,25-D3 promotes myogenesis. This study supports the mechanistic rationale for assessing the administration of vitamin D and/or vitamin D analogs to treat select muscle disorders and may also provide an alternative solution for therapies that directly manipulate VEGF and FGF's to promote angiogenesis.", "journal": "The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology", "date": "2012-09-18", "authors": ["Leah AGarcia", "Monica GFerrini", "Keith CNorris", "Jorge NArtaza"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.09.004"}

The patient presented initial favorable clinical and radiological results which were maintained at 34 months during the last follow-up.

A reliable in vivo animal model is required for investigations in vascularized whole-limb CTA. The model should allow in vivo assessment in whole-limb preservation, allograft and xenograft response, and host immunomodulation. The goal of this study is to describe and evaluate the in vivo feasibility and reproducibility of a whole-limb porcine model as a basis for future research in this field.\nIn seven large white pigs, one forelimb was amputated under anesthesia and autotransplanted heterotopically with an arc of rotation of 180\u00b0 and partially placed in a subcutaneous pocket. Clinical parameters were monitored and muscle biopsies were analyzed using ultrastructural morphological assessment of mitochondria quality after an observation period of 7 days.\nAll animals could fully mobilize postoperatively without restrictions. At sacrifice, the anastomosed pedicle vessels of the limb were patent in six animals. In one pig, venous thrombosis could be observed. Muscle response was triggered following direct electrostimulation in six replanted limbs. The replanted extremities gained 12.97% weight within 7 days postreplantation compared with the amputation baseline values (P = 0.464 while maintaining normal compartment pressures at sacrifice (8.25 \u00b1 5.31 cmH(2)O, P = 0.60).

FVFHG was performed on 12 patients with giant cell tumors of the distal radius between April 1984 and July 2005. The mean age of patients was 33 years. All 12 patients were classified as Enneking stage 2. Outcomes were evaluated with radiographic and functional assessments, including the scale of Enneking. The mean follow-up period was 6.26 years. Bone union was achieved in all patients at a mean of 15.7 weeks after surgery. Skin grafting was performed at the recipient site in 5 patients and had good skin healing. Subluxation in the wrist joint was observed in 5 patients and was related to the length of the transplanted fibula. The 5 patients with subluxation experienced considerable osteoarthritic change. The mean arc of flexion-extension and rotation of the wrist joint was 73.1\u00b0 and 102.9\u00b0, respectively. The mean grip strength was 57.25% of the contralateral side. The mean functional score was 26.4 points. Wrist arthroplasty with a FVFHG is a useful option to treat Enneking stage 2 giant cell tumors of the distal radius. We believe that wrist instability is not determined by the choice of laterality of the fibula, which can be minimized by transplanting a short fibula with the anterior tibial artery as a donor artery. The recipient sites can be successfully resurfaced by skin grafting.", "journal": "Microsurgery", "date": "2012-09-15", "authors": ["Duke WhanChung", "Chung SooHan", "Jae HoonLee", "Sang GilLee"], "doi": "10.1002/micr.22028"}
{"title": "Multinephron dynamics on the renal vascular network.", "abstract": "Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and the myogenic mechanism combine in each nephron to regulate blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Both mechanisms are nonlinear, generate self-sustained oscillations, and interact as their signals converge on arteriolar smooth muscle, forming a regulatory ensemble. Ensembles may synchronize. Smooth muscle cells in the ensemble depolarize periodically, generating electrical signals that propagate along the vascular network. We developed a mathematical model of a nephron-vascular network, with 16 versions of a single nephron model containing representations of both mechanisms in the regulatory ensemble, to examine the effects of network structure on nephron synchronization. Symmetry, as a property of a network, facilitates synchronization. Nephrons received blood from a symmetric electrically conductive vascular tree. Symmetry was created by using identical nephron models at each of the 16 sites and symmetry breaking by varying nephron length. The symmetric model achieved synchronization of all elements in the network. As little as 1% variation in nephron length caused extensive desynchronization, although synchronization was maintained in small nephron clusters. In-phase synchronization predominated among nephrons separated by one or three vascular nodes and antiphase synchronization for five or seven nodes of separation. Nephron dynamics were irregular and contained low-frequency fluctuations. Results are consistent with simultaneous blood flow measurements in multiple nephrons. An interaction between electrical signals propagated through the network to cause synchronization; variation in vascular pressure at vessel bifurcations was a principal cause of desynchronization. The results suggest that the vasculature supplies blood to nephrons but also engages in robust information transfer.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Based on the highest amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by human fibroblasts grown on n-BG coatings (0-1.245 mg/cm(2)), decellularized trabecular bone samples (porosity: 43-81%) were coated with n-BG particles. Grown on n-BG particles at a coating density of 0.263 mg/cm(2), human fibroblasts produced 4.3 times more VEGF than on uncoated controls. After 8 weeks of implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, both uncoated and n-BG-coated samples were well infiltrated with newly formed tissue (47-48%) and blood vessels (3-4%). No significant differences were found in cellularization and vascularization between uncoated bone scaffolds and n-BG-coated scaffolds. This finding indicates that the decellularized bone itself may exhibit growth-promoting properties induced by the highly interconnected pore microarchitecture and/or proteins left behind on decellularized scaffolds. Even if we did not find proangiogenic effects in n-BG-coated bone scaffolds, a bioactive coating is considered to be beneficial to impart osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties to decellularized bone. n-BG-coated bone grafts have thus high clinical potential for the regeneration of complex tissue defects given their ability for recellularization and neovascularization.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

However, the mechanism by which it is upregulated is not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that conditional deletion of two transcription factors that signal for the bone morphogenetic proteins (Smad1 and Smad5) in ovarian granulosa cells causes metastatic granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) in female mice and phenocopies human juvenile GCTs (JGCTs). Smad1/5 double conditional knockout tumors, as well as human JGCTs, are highly vascularized, hemorrhagic and mitotically active. Expression analysis of these tumors and their metastases revealed a significant upregulation of key proliferation and pro-angiogenic factors such as Pdgfa, Pdgfb and Vegf. We examined whether these genes were direct targets of SMAD1 and SMAD5. Knockdown of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in mouse primary granulosa cells and a human GCT-derived cell line (COV434) resulted in upregulation of PDGFA, but not PDGFB nor VEGF. We identified several putative SMAD1/5-binding sites in the PDGFA promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated that SMAD1/5 interact with the PDGFA promoter to regulate its activity. Further, SMAD1/5 antagonize the activity of the transcription factor Sp1, a well-known positive regulator of PDGFA, by inhibiting its occupancy at a key regulatory site on the proximal PDGFA promoter. Collectively, our studies establish that loss of SMAD1/5 leads to upregulation of PDGFA in ovarian granulosa cells, and that a novel regulatory interaction exists between the BR-SMADs and Sp1 in controlling PDGFA expression during granulosa cell tumorigenesis.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2012-09-12", "authors": ["S KTripurani", "R WCook", "K WEldin", "S APangas"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2012.392"}

In this study, we have characterized the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors in 33 human vascular anomalies. Analysis with quantitative real-time PCR and gene-specific assays showed higher expression of neuropilin-2 (NRP2) and VEGF-receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) mRNAs in vascular malformations (VascM) as compared to infantile hemangiomas (Hem). In addition, the expression levels of PlGF and VEGF-C mRNA were significantly higher in venous VascM when compared to the other VascM and Hem. Higher expression of NRP2 and VEGFR-3 were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. To further study the importance of NRP2 and VEGFR-3, endothelial cell (EC) cultures were established from vascular anomalies. It was found that NRP2 and VEGFR-3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in some of the VascM ECs as compared to human umbilical vein ECs which were used as control cells in the study. Furthermore, adenoviral delivery of soluble decoy NRP2 prevented the proliferation of ECs isolated from most of the vascular anomalies. Our findings suggest that NRP2 functions as a factor maintaining the pathological vascular network in these anomalies.

Following resolution of ulcerative keratitis, sectoral peripheral superficial corneal gray opacification, vascularization, and pigmentation slowly migrated centripetally to the axial cornea of both eyes. Corneal sensitivity measured with a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer was dramatically and persistently reduced. In vivo corneal confocal microscopic examination revealed regions of epithelium with a conjunctival phenotype. In these areas, the surface epithelium was thin, disorganized, and composed of hyper-reflective epithelial cells. Goblet cells and Langerhans cells were frequent, and the subbasal nerve plexus was completely absent or markedly diminished. Histopathologic abnormalities in the globes were restricted to the superficial cornea and included sectoral corneal conjunctivalization, increased anterior stromal spindle cells, and vascularization. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the corneas with anti-neurotublin antibody demonstrated attenuation of the epithelial and subbasal nerve plexuses with marked stromal hyperinnervation and increased numbers of morphologically abnormal neurites.\nSimilar to herpes simplex virus keratitis in humans, CHV-1 ulcerative keratitis may be associated with the development of chronic degenerative corneal disease in dogs.

Advance stage disease features are associated with tumor vascularity, and as such, angiogenesis inhibitors may prove useful along with current therapies. The matricellular protein, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), is known to inhibit proliferation and migration of endothelial cells stimulated by growth factors. Here, we sought to determine the effect of SPARC on neuroblastoma tumor cell-induced angiogenesis and to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis inhibition. Conditioned medium from SPARC-overexpressed neuroblastoma cells (pSPARC-CM) inhibited endothelial tube formation, cell proliferation, induced programmed cell death and suppressed expression of pro-angiogenic molecules such as VEGF, FGF, PDGF, and MMP-9 in endothelial cells. Further analyses revealed that pSPARC-CM-suppressed expression of growth factors was mediated by inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway, and cells cultured on conditioned medium from tumor cells that overexpress both Notch intracellular domain (NICD-CM) and SPARC resumed the pSPARC-CM-suppressed capillary tube formation and growth factor expression in vitro. Further, SPARC overexpression in neuroblastoma cells inhibited neo-vascularization in vivo in a mouse dorsal air sac model. Furthermore, SPARC overexpression-induced endothelial cell death was observed by co-localization studies with TUNEL assay and an endothelial marker, CD31, in xenograft tumor sections from SPARC-overexpressed mice.

However, the etiopathogenesis of pyogenic granuloma is poorly understood and whether pyogenic granuloma being a reactive process or a tumor is unknown. In an attempt to clarify this issue, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of laser-captured vessels from pyogenic granuloma and from a richly vascularized tissue, placenta, as well as, from proliferative and involutive hemangiomas. Our study identified a gene signature specific to pyogenic granuloma. In the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) database, this signature was linked to 'white blood cells monocytes'. It also demonstrated high enrichment for gene ontology terms corresponding to 'vasculature development' and 'regulation of blood pressure'. This signature included genes of the nitric oxide pathway alongside genes related to hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and vascular injury, three conditions biologically interconnected. Finally, one of the genes specifically associated with pyogenic granuloma was FLT4, a tyrosine-kinase receptor related to pathological angiogenesis.

We have shown that the angiogenic factor endocrine gland-derived VEGF (EG-VEGF) and its receptors, prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) and 2, (1) are abundantly expressed in human placenta, (2) are up-regulated by hypoxia, (3) control trophoblast invasion, and that EG-VEGF circulating levels are the highest during the first trimester of pregnancy, the period of important placental growth. These findings suggest that EG-VEGF/PROKR1 and 2 might be involved in normal and FGR placental development. To test this hypothesis, we used placental explants, primary trophoblast cultures, and placental and serum samples collected from FGR and age-matched control women. Our results show that (1) EG-VEGF increases trophoblast proliferation ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and Ki67-staining) via the homeobox-gene, HLX (2) the proliferative effect involves PROKR1 but not PROKR2, (3) EG-VEGF does not affect syncytium formation (measurement of syncytin 1 and 2 and \u03b2 hCG production) (4) EG-VEGF increases the vascularization of the placental villi and insures their survival, (5) EG-VEGF, PROKR1, and PROKR2 mRNA and protein levels are significantly elevated in FGR placentas, and (6) EG-VEGF circulating levels are significantly higher in FGR patients. Altogether, our results identify EG-VEGF as a new placental growth factor acting during the first trimester of pregnancy, established its mechanism of action, and provide evidence for its deregulation in FGR.

Two porous metal percutaneous implants, one treated with BMMSCs and one untreated, were placed subdermally on the dorsum of Lewis rats. Implants were evaluated at 0, 3, 7, 28, and 56 days after implantation. Histological analyses evaluated cellular infiltrates, vascularization, quantity and quality of tissue ingrowth, epidermal downgrowth, and fibrous encapsulation. The amount of collagen infiltrating the porous coating was significantly greater for the BMMSC-treated implants at 3 and 28 days post implantation compared to untreated implants. There was an early influx and resolution of cellular inflammatory infiltrates in the treated implants compared to the untreated, though not statistically significant. Vascularization increased over time in both treated and untreated implants, with no statistical significance. Epidermal downgrowth was minimally observed in all implants with or without the BMMSC treatment. Our results suggest that BMMSCs can influence an early and rapid resolution of acute and chronic inflammation in wound healing, and can stimulate early collagen deposition and granulation tissue associated with later stages of wound repair.

F/P MPs immobilized more than 3 \u03bcg of HGF per mg of MPs and gradually released the absorbed HGF into the medium with a half-release time of approximately 5 days. Compared with HGF alone, HGF-containing F/P MPs substantially enhanced the mitogenic effect of HGF on cultured human microvascular endothelial cells, by prolonging the biological half-life, and its conjugation to F/P MPs protected HGF from heat and proteolytic inactivation. F/P MPs disappeared 8 days after subcutaneous injection in mice, suggesting that they are rapidly biodegraded. Furthermore, the number of large (diameter \u2265200 \u03bcm or containing \u2265 100 erythrocytes) and medium (diameter 20-200 \u03bcm or containing 10-100 erythrocytes) lumen capillaries 8 days after injection of HGF-containing F/P MPs was significantly higher than that after injection of HGF or F/P MPs alone. Furthermore, the number of small (diameter \u2264 20 \u03bcm or containing 1-10 erythrocytes) lumen capillaries was significantly higher 4 days after injection of HGF-containing F/P MPs. This increased angiogenic activity of HGF in vivo is probably due to both sustained local release and protection against biodegradation by the F/P MPs. Thus, F/P MPs may be useful and safe HGF carriers that facilitate cell proliferation and vascularization at sites of tissue damage.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2012-09-01", "authors": ["SatokoKishimoto", "MasayukiIshihara", "ShingoNakamura", "MasanoriFujita", "MegumiTakikawa", "YukiSumi", "TomoharuKiyosawa", "ToshinoriSato", "YasuhiroKanatani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.003"}

Intriguingly, application of MLL1 antisense specifically knocked down MLL1 in vivo and suppressed the growth of xenografted cervical tumor implanted in nude mouse. MLL1 knockdown downregulated various growth and angiogenic factors, such as HIF1\u03b1, VEGF and CD31, in tumor tissue affecting tumor growth. MLL1 is overexpressed along the line of vascular network and localized adjacent to endothelial cell layer expressing CD31, indicating potential roles of MLL1 in vasculogenesis. MLL1 is also overexpressed in the hypoxic regions along with HIF1\u03b1.

{"title": "Human adipose tissue-derived SSEA-4 subpopulation multi-differentiation potential towards the endothelial and osteogenic lineages.", "abstract": "Human adipose tissue has been recently recognized as a potential source of stem cells for regenerative medicine applications, including bone tissue engineering (TE). Despite the gathered knowledge regarding the differentiation potential of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs), in what concerns the endothelial lineage many uncertainties are still present. The existence of a cell subpopulation within the human adipose tissue that expresses a SSEA-4 marker, usually associated to pluripotency, raises expectations on the differentiation capacity of these cells (SSEA-4(+)hASCs). In the present study, the endothelial and osteogenic differentiation potential of the SSEA-4(+)hASCs was analyzed, aiming at proposing a single-cell source/subpopulation for the development of vascularized bone TE constructs. SSEA-4(+)hASCs were isolated using immunomagnetic sorting and cultured either in \u03b1-MEM, in EGM-2 MV (endothelial growth medium), or in osteogenic medium. SSEA-4(+)hASCs cultured in EGM-2 MV formed endothelial cell-like colonies characterized by a cobblestone morphology and expression of CD31, CD34, CD105, and von Willebrand factor as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. The endothelial phenotype was also confirmed by their ability to incorporate acetylated low-density lipoprotein and to form capillary-like structures when seeded on Matrigel. SSEA-4(+)hASCs cultured in \u03b1-MEM displayed fibroblastic-like morphology and exhibited a mesenchymal surface marker profile (>90% CD90(+)/CD73(+)/CD105(+)). After culture in osteogenic conditions, an overexpression of osteogenic-related markers (osteopontin and osteocalcin) was observed both at molecular and protein levels. Matrix mineralization detected by Alizarin Red staining confirmed SSEA-4(+)hASCs osteogenic differentiation. Herein, we demonstrate that from a single-cell source, human adipose tissue, and by selecting the appropriate subpopulation it is possible to obtain microvascular-like endothelial cells and osteoblasts, the most relevant cell types for the creation of vascularized bone tissue-engineered constructs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

{"title": "Contribution of endothelial cells to human bone-derived cells expansion in coculture.", "abstract": "Creating a functional vascularized bone tissue remains one of the main goals of bone tissue engineering. Recently, a growing interest in the crosstalk between endothelial cells (EC) and osteoblasts (OB), the two main players in a new bone formation, has been observed. However, only a few reports have addressed a mutual influence of OB and EC on cell proliferation. Our study focuses on this issue by investigating cocultures of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Three various proportions of cells have been used that is, HBDC:HUVEC 1:1, 1:4, and 4:1 and the cocultures were investigated on day 1, 4, and 7, while HUVEC and HBDC monocultures served as reference. We have detected enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in a direct HBDC-HUVEC coculture. This effect was not observed when cells were separated by an insert, which is consistent with other reports on various OB-EC lineages. The appearance of gap-junctions in coculture was confirmed by a positive staining for connexin 43. The number of cells of both phenotypes has been determined by flow cytometry: CD-31-positive cells have been considered EC, while CD-31-negative have been counted as OB. We have observed an over 14-fold increase in OB number after a week in the 1:4 HBDC:HUVEC coculture as compared with less than fourfold in monoculture. The increase in HBDC number in 1:1 coculture has been less pronounced and has reached the value of about sevenfold. These results correspond well with the cell proliferation rate, which has been measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation. Moreover, at day 7 EC have been still present in the coculture, which is inconsistent with some other reports. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis has revealed the upregulation of ALP and collagen type I genes, but not osteocalcin gene, in all the cocultures grown without pro-osteogenic additives. Our study indicates that HUVEC significantly promote HBDC expansion and upregulate collagen I gene expression in these cells.

Tie-1 and Tie-2 are essential for vascular maturation during developmental, physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Angiopoietin 1-4 (Ang-1-4) have been identified as bona fide ligands of the Tie-2 receptor, while Tie-1 remains an orphan receptor which is able to heterodimerize with Tie-2 and to modulate Tie-2 signal transduction. The most exhaustively studied angiopoietins are Ang-1 and Ang-2. Ang-1 is a critical player in vessel maturation and it mediates migration, adhesion and survival of endothelial cells. Ang-2 disrupts the connections between the endothelium and perivascular cells and promotes cell death and vascular regression. Yet, in conjunction with VEGF, Ang-2 promotes neo-vascularization. Hence, angiopoietins exert crucial roles in the angiogenic switch during tumor progression, and increased expression of Ang-2 relative to Ang-1 in tumors correlates with poor prognosis.

Recent studies have reported survival rates of fat grafts to vary anywhere between 10% and 80% over time. The present study evaluated the long-term viability of human fat grafts in a murine model using a novel imaging technique allowing for in vivo volumetric analysis.\nHuman fat grafts were prepared from lipoaspirate samples using the Coleman technique. Fat was injected subcutaneously into the scalp of 10 adult Crl:NU-Foxn1(nu) CD-1 male mice. Micro-computed tomography (CT) was performed immediately following injection and then weekly thereafter. Fat volume was rendered by reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) surface through cubic-spline interpolation. Specimens were also harvested at various time points and sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), for macrophages using CD68 and for the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). Finally, samples were explanted at 8- and 12-week time points to validate calculated micro-CT volumes.\nWeekly CT scanning demonstrated progressive volume loss over the time course. However, volumetric analysis at the 8- and 12-week time points stabilized, showing an average of 62.2% and 60.9% survival, respectively. Gross analysis showed the fat graft to be healthy and vascularized. H&E analysis and staining for CD68 showed minimal inflammatory reaction with viable adipocytes. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-human CB1 antibodies confirmed human origin of the adipocytes.\nStudies assessing the fate of autologous fat grafts in animals have focused on nonimaging modalities, including histological and biochemical analyses, which require euthanasia of the animals.

{"title": "EphA2-mediated mesenchymal-amoeboid transition induced by endothelial progenitor cells enhances metastatic spread due to cancer-associated fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Tumor progression is deeply influenced by epigenetic changes induced by tumor stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been reported to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, thereby enhancing their aggressiveness and stem-like properties. As CAFs are able to recruit endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to tumor site, we aim to investigate their interplay for prostate carcinoma progression. Both prostate CAFs and cancer cells actively recruit EPCs, known to affect tumor progression through increased vasculogenesis. EPCs synergize with CAFs to further promote epigenetic plasticity of cancer cells, through a mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition. Indeed, after fibroblasts have engaged epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, a further shift towards amoeboid motility is promoted by EPCs through contact-mediated triggering of the bidirectional ephrinA1/EphA2 signaling. The activation of ephrinA1 reverse pathway enhances EPC-induced neo-vascularization, thus promoting tumor growth, while EphA2 forward signaling elicits mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in cancer cells, favoring their adhesion to endothelium, transendothelial migration, and lung metastatic colonization. We therefore underscore that the metastatic advantage given by tumor microenvironment embraces different motility strategies and propose EphA2-targeted tools as useful adjuvants in anti-metastatic treatments.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2012-08-21", "authors": ["ElisaGiannoni", "Maria LetiziaTaddei", "MatteoParri", "FrancescaBianchini", "MichelaSantosuosso", "RenataGrifantini", "GabriellaFibbi", "BenedettaMazzanti", "LidoCalorini", "PaolaChiarugi"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-012-0941-9"}

Oxygenated blood shows less MTR contrast compared to deoxygenated blood sample; and higher levels of oxygen inhalation decrease tissue MTR in vivo especially in brain tumor region. The percentage reduction of MTR due to hyperoxia inhalation, referred to as the blood oxygen dependent magnetization transfer (BOLDMT) effect, correlates well with tissue oxygen extraction, which is highest in well-vascularized tumor rim, followed by inner tumor, gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) normal tissue.

Patients with major defects (>2.5 cm in max. diameter, n = 15), comprising those with malignoma, meningoencephalocele, aneurysmatic bone cyst and trauma, were repaired by a \"sandwich technique\" with a combination of calvarian split and galea periosteum flap in 10 patients, in one case with a temporalis muscle flap, while in 4 further patients free vascularised radial forearm flaps were used for revision after multiple unsuccessful operations elsewhere. After a mean follow-up time of 30.5 months 38 of the 41 cases were successfully repaired with respect to prevention and treatment of CSF leakage or brain tissue prolapse, only 3 cases needed surgical revision.

{"title": "Human adipose-derived stem cells enhance the angiogenic potential of endothelial progenitor cells, but not of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.", "abstract": "One of the current challenges in the field of adipose tissue engineering is to promote sufficient vascularization to prevent cell death and to support adipose tissue formation. Thus, a novel strategy to enhance neovascularization of tissue-engineered adipose tissue might be the coimplantation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). However, no knowledge is given about the cellular interaction in vitro of human ASCs derived from subcutaneous fat tissue and EPCs derived from human peripheral blood. In this study, the first aim was to characterize ASCs and EPCs. Secondly, the two-dimensional Matrigel assay and the three-dimensional spheroid sprouting assay were applied for analyzing the ASC-EPC interaction in regard to formation of capillary-like structures by EPCs by ASC-conditioned medium (CM) or coculture of both cell types and compared to cocultures of ASCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). ASC-CM had no influence on the formation of capillary-like structures by EPCs. However, coculture with ASCs significantly enhanced the formation of capillary-like structures by EPCs; an effect that was not observed in cocultures of ASCs with HUVECs. Importantly, this increase in capillary-like structure formation by EPCs due to cell-cell contact was associated with significantly increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and VEGF-A mRNA expression, while inhibition of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases completely abolished this effect. In conclusion, these data suggest that cellular communication occurs between ASCs and EPCs triggered by cell-cell contact or at least close proximity, which is partially mediated by secreted VEGF leading to the enhancement of angiogenic properties in EPCs, but not in HUVECs.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Fourteen patients developed vesicovaginal and five developed ureterovaginal fistula. Urethrocystoscopy was sufficient for the diagnosis in nearly 50% of the patients and when combined with methylene blue instillation 90% of all fistulae were found. Several patients sought medical advice due to vaginal leakage following gynaecological surgery without the doctor suspecting a fistula, and for these patients the diagnosis was delayed. Eighteen patients were operated on with an abdominal approach and one with a vaginal approach, in all cases a minimum of 3 months after primary surgery. The reconstruction technique included the interposition of vascularized tissue. None of the patients reported leakage or relapse at follow-up after fistula repair.\nHysterectomy was the most common cause behind the formation of urovaginal fistulae.

When there is a need for an osteofasciocutaneous free flap, the free fibula flap is the first choice because of the advantages of its long bone structure, high reliability, and minimal donor-site morbidity. However, most of these patients receive adjuvant radiation therapy, which sometimes causes symptomatic fibrosis, contractures, and (osteo)radionecrosis. In case of these late complications, locoregional reconstructive options are often limited, and complex secondary free flap procedures are not always feasible or preferred by the patient.

{"title": "The potential use of allogeneic platelet-rich plasma for large bone defect treatment: immunogenicity and defect healing efficacy.", "abstract": "Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been extensively investigated for large bone defect treatment, but its clinical application is harassed by controversial outcome, due to highly variable PRP quality among patients. Alternatively, allogeneic PRP from well-characterized donors cannot only generate more consistent and reliable therapeutic effect but also avoid harvesting large quantities of blood, an additional health burdens to patients. However, the use of allogeneic PRP for bone defect treatment is generally less investigated, especially for its immunogenicity in such application. Here, we meticulously investigated the immunogenicity of allogeneic PRP and evaluated its healing efficacy for critical-sized defect treatment. Allogeneic PRP contained 4.1-fold and 2.7- to 4.9-fold higher amount of platelets and growth factors than whole blood, respectively. The intramuscular injection of allogeneic PRP to rabbits did not trigger severe and chronic immunoresponse, evidenced by little change in muscular tissue microstructure and CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a T lymphocyte subpopulation in peripheral blood. The implantation of allogeneic PRP/deproteinized bone matrix (DPB) constructs (PRP+DPB) successfully bridged 1.5-cm segmental radial defects in rabbits, achieving similar healing capacity as autologous MSC/DPB constructs (MSC+DPB), with greater bone formation (1.1-1.5\u00d7, p<0.05) and vascularization (1.3-1.6\u00d7, p<0.05) than DPB alone, shown by histomorphometric analysis, bone mineral density measurement, and radionuclide bone imaging. Furthermore, the implantation of both allogeneic PRP- and autologous MSC-mediated DPB constructs (PRP + MSC + DPB) resulted in the most robust bone regeneration (1.2-2.1\u00d7, p<0.05) and vascularization (1.3-2.0\u00d7, p<0.05) than others (PRP+DPB, MSC+DPB, or DPB alone). This study has demonstrated the promising use of allogeneic PRP for bone defect treatment with negligible immunogenicity, great healing efficacy, potentially more consistent quality, and no additional health burden to patients; additionally, the synergetic enhancing effect found between allogeneic PRP and autologous MSCs may shed a light on developing new therapeutic strategies for large bone defect treatment.", "journal": "Cell transplantation", "date": "2012-08-07", "authors": ["Zhi-YongZhang", "Ai-WenHuang", "Jun JunFan", "KuanhaiWei", "DanJin", "BinChen", "DanLi", "LongBi", "JunWang", "GuoxianPei"], "doi": "10.3727/096368912X653183"}

We propose a periosteal substitute engineered using a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) membrane incorporating autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PRP/BMSC gel membrane) to be wrapped around an osteoconductive scaffold for regeneration of compromised bone defects. The PRP/BMSC gel membrane was optimized using different compositions for optimal release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Survival and proliferation of cells in the PRP gel membrane with time were confirmed in addition to their osteogenic capacity. Furthermore, to evaluate the possible effects of the PRP/BMSC gel membrane on surrounding progenitor cells in the injury area, we found that the PRP gel membrane products could significantly induce the migration of human endothelial cells in vitro, and increased the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 in cultured BMSC. These cells also secreted significant amounts of soluble proangiogenic factors, such as PDGF-BB, VEGF, and interleukin-8 (IL-8).

{"title": "Bach1 is critical for the transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Ras(V12) and maintains ERK signaling.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), by-products of aerobic respiration, promote genetic instability and contribute to the malignant transformation of cells. Among the genes related to ROS metabolism, Bach1 is a repressor of the oxidative stress response, and a negative regulator of ROS-induced cellular senescence directed by p53 in higher eukaryotes. While ROS are intimately involved in carcinogenesis, it is not clear whether Bach1 is involved in this process. We found that senescent Bach1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) underwent spontaneous immortalization the same as did the wild-type cells. When transduced with constitutively active Ras (H-Ras(V12)), the proliferation and colony formation of these cells in vitro were markedly reduced. When transplanted into athymic nude mice, the growth and vascularization of tumors derived from Bach1-deficient cells were also decreased. Gene expression profiling of the MEFs revealed a new H-Ras(V12) signature, which was distinct from the previously reported signatures in epithelial tumors, and was partly dependent on Bach1. The Bach1-deficient cells showed diminished phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 in response to H-Ras(V12), which was consistent with the alterations in the gene expression profile, including phosphatase genes. Finally, Bach1-deficient mice were less susceptible to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxidide (4-NQO)-induced tongue carcinoma than wild-type mice.

Imaging of these parameters in vivo can lead to better individual noninvasive methods to assess drug penetration in situ.\nIn this manuscript the dependence of nanoparticle delivery is addressed from the standpoint of vascular factors (the more vascularized, the better delivery) and as a function of collagen density and interstitial pressure (the higher these are, the worse the delivery).", "journal": "Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine", "date": "2012-07-31", "authors": ["SasonTorosean", "BrendanFlynn", "JohanAxelsson", "JasonGunn", "Kimberley SSamkoe", "TayyabaHasan", "Marvin MDoyley", "Brian WPogue"], "doi": "10.1016/j.nano.2012.07.002"}

Ex vivo transplantation of stem cell-derived tracheas has been established in humans using external tissue bioreactors. These bioreactors, however, are not widely accessible. Thus, we are developing a rotational flap-based \"internal bioreactor\" to allow in vivo stem cell engraftment in a pre-vascularized recipient bed.

Herein, we present a study investigating the feasibility of two pedicle muscle flaps for implantation and subsequent tracheal transplantation. Trapezius and latissimus flaps were raised using established surgical techniques. The length and width of each flap, along with the distance from the pedicle takeoff to the trachea, were measured. The overall ability of the flaps to reach the trachea was assessed. Twelve flaps were raised in 5 fresh adult human cadavers. For the trapezius flap, averages were: flap length of 16.4 cm, flap width of 5.95 cm at the tip, and distance from the pedicle takeoff to the trachea of 11.1 cm. For the latissimus dorsi flap, averages were: flap length of 35.4 cm, flap width of 7.25 cm at the tip, and distance from the pedicle takeoff to the trachea of 27.3 cm.

To address this limitation, we have developed an in vitro vascularization model in which a decellularized porcine small bowl segment, representing a capillary network within a collagen matrix (biological vascularized scaffold [BioVaSc]), is reseeded with microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs). However, since the supply of mvECs is limited, in general, and as these cells rapidly dedifferentiate, we have applied a novel technology, which allows the generation of large batches of quasi-primary cells with the ability to proliferate, whilst maintaining their differentiated functionality. These so called upcyte mvECs grew for an additional 15 population doublings (PDs) compared to primary cells. Upcyte mvECs retained endothelial characteristics, such as von Willebrandt Factor (vWF), CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, as well as positive Ulex europaeus agglutinin I staining. Upcyte mvECs also retained biological functionality such as tube formation, cell migration, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, which were still evident after PD27. Initial experiments using MTT and Live/Dead staining indicate that upcyte mvECs repopulate the BioVaSc Scaffold. As with conventional cultures, these cells also express key endothelial molecules (vWF, CD31, and eNOS) in a custom-made bioreactor system even after a prolonged period of 14 days. The combination of upcyte mvECs and the BioVaSc represents a novel and promising approach toward vascularizing bioreactor models which can better reflect organs, such as the liver.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

During recent years, several papers have been published in English regarding remnant stomach EP, and different aspects of this procedure have been discussed. However, there is still no comprehensive literature review analysing the possible EP approaches using the remnant stomach. A multilingual literature search (database and manual) to collect and classify the currently available data regarding remnant stomach EP following DGE and its subsequent analysis was carried out. There are a number of principally different methods of a remnant stomach EP: (1) mobilization of the remnant stomach with the spleen and tail of the pancreas with its transposition into the left hemithorax; (2) mobilization of the remnant stomach after splenectomy; (3) implementation of a reversed gastric tube, tailored from the major curve; (4) the use of a transplant fed from the right gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries; (5) the use of a transplant fed from the left gastric and short gastric arteries; (6) complete mobilization of the remnant stomach; (7) direct revascularization of the gastric stump conduit.

Mass transport has been identified as the primary culprit, limiting the delivery of nutrients (such as oxygen and glucose) and removal of wastes, from tissues deep within a cellular scaffold. While strategies to develop sufficient vasculature to overcome hypoxia in vitro are promising, inconsistencies between the in vitro and the in vivo environments may still negate the effectiveness of large-volume tissue-engineered scaffolds. While a common theme in tissue engineering is to maximize oxygen supply, studies suggest that moderate oxygenation of cellular scaffolds during in vitro conditioning is preferable to high oxygen levels. Aiming for moderate oxygen values to prevent hypoxia while still promoting angiogenesis may be obtained by tailoring in vitro culture conditions to the oxygen environment the scaffold will experience upon implantation.

Serial 3D-PDU scans were performed during treatment, providing ultrasonographic measurement of tumor size, vascularization index, flow index and vascularization flow index, as well as monthly for 3 months post-treatment and tri-monthly thereafter, until vascularity was undetectable on two consecutive occasions. Physical examination, cervical cytology and serum marker evaluation were performed every 3-6 months for the first 5 years following treatment. Patients evaluated after a 2-year tumor-free interval and those with clinically assessed positive findings at follow-up underwent 3D-PDU to detect possible local disease.\nA total of 329 3D-PDU scans were performed in the 37 women. Cervical tumors and intratumoral vascularization disappeared within 3 months following radiotherapy, except in one patient with persistent disease. Nine patients had disease relapse, in four of whom the recurrence was local. In three of these four, there was recurrence of tumor and vascularization after a complete response. At follow-up, 3D-PDU detected local disease with 75.0% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity, while serum markers detected local disease among 34 patients with squamous cell carcinoma with 20.0% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity.\nCompared with serum markers in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, 3D-PDU has higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting local recurrence or persistence in cervical carcinoma.

Intravenous administration of these cells is the preferred route for therapeutic delivery of MSCs. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are the first cell type that MSCs encounter following IV administration. However, little is known about the biological consequences of interactions between MSCs and ECs, and if any therapeutic benefit results from this interaction. We show that MSCs exert potent stabilizing effects on ECs using an in vitro coculture system. Such effects include decreased EC proliferation and the reduction of EC vascular network formation in matrigel. Interestingly, these effects appear to require EC-MSC contact and result in enhanced colocalization of VE-Cadherin and \u03b2-catenin at the cell membrane. Disruption of the VE-Cadherin/\u03b2-catenin interaction abrogates the observed effects. As a functional in vivo correlate, we show that intravenously administered MSCs strongly inhibit angiogenesis in a matrigel plug assay. Taken together, these results identify a novel mechanism of action of MSCs that involves a contact-dependent EC interaction. These findings are relevant to intravenous use of MSCs and provide insight into further optimizing therapeutic strategies involving MSCs.", "journal": "Stem cells and development", "date": "2012-06-28", "authors": ["TylerMenge", "MichaelGerber", "KathrynWataha", "WilliamReid", "SushovanGuha", "Charles SCox", "PramodDash", "Marvin SReitz", "Aarif YKhakoo", "ShibaniPati"], "doi": "10.1089/scd.2012.0165"}

However, the possibility that these compounds may also prevent vascularization in physiological situations is a major drawback for their use. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of 0.1-100 \u03bcM catechin on endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) regarding angiogenic and inflammatory processes. Catechin modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation was also evaluated in vivo using different models of angiogenesis: one physiological (skin wound-healing assay) and another one resembling pathological angiogenesis, exhibiting higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A stimulation (Matrigel plug assay). The in vitro results showed that 100 \u03bcM catechin increased viability (to 165.58% and to 165.34%) and decreased apoptosis (53.45% and 92.65%) and proliferation (33.19% and 23.36%) of EC and VSMC, respectively.

Nevertheless, catechin diminished in vitro inflammatory modulators such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (58.66% for human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 85.46% for human aortic smooth muscle cells) and nuclear factor kappa-B (38.43% for VSMC). The in vivo results demonstrated that catechin did not change angiogenesis and inflammation in skin wound-healing model and substantially decreased these processes in Matrigel plug assay.

While 2D substrates with tunable elasticity have been studied for control of stem cell differentiation, we recently developed a stratified co-culture model of angiogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that differentiate on a tunable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, thereby creating a physiologic context for elasticity-induced differentiation. Endothelial cells (EC) were cultured on top of the hMSC construct on a collagen gel to monitor network formation. Media composition influenced EC invasion due to the conditioning media, the reduction of serum and supplemental growth factors, and the addition of recombinant growth factors. Conditioned media, recombinant growth factors and direct co-culture were compared for endothelial cell invasive response using quantitative image analysis. As anticipated, use of recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced the deepest EC invasions while direct co-culture caused shallow invasions compared to other conditions. However, endothelial cells displayed lumen-like morphology, suggesting that cell-cell interaction in the co-culture model could mimic sprouting behaviour. In summary, an engineered suitable biochemical and physical environment facilitated endothelial cells to form 3D vessel structures onto hMSCs. These structures were plated on a stiff surface known to induce osteodifferentiation of stem cells.

This study evaluates the regenerative potential of GBR in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delivery via an injectable hydrogel system.\nCritical-sized defects were created in rat calvariae, and GBR procedures were performed with a collagen membrane alone (control), or plus bolus delivery of VEGF, or plus application of VEGF-releasing hydrogels (VEGF-Alg). Four and 8 weeks after treatment, defect sites were evaluated with microcomputed tomographic and histomorphometric analyses for blood vessel and bone formation.\nAt 4 weeks, relative to the control condition, the bolus addition of VEGF did not affect blood vessel density within the defect site, yet the application of VEGF-Alg significantly (P <0.05) increased blood vessel density. Although there was no difference in bone regeneration at 4 weeks, at 8 weeks there was a significant (P <0.05) increase in bone regeneration in the VEGF-Alg-treated defects.\nThese data demonstrate that the application of VEGF-Alg enhanced early angiogenesis, whereas at a later time point, it enhanced bone regeneration.

Main manifestations include central nervous system (CNS) and retinal haemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. RCC has become the first potential cause of mortality and VHL disease is the main cause of inherited RCC. The disease is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor-suppressor gene that plays a major role in regulation of the oxygen-sensing pathway by targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF for degradation in proteasome. VHL has also major HIF-independent functions, specially in regulation of primary cilium, extracellular matrix and apoptosis. Somatic inactivation of the VHL gene is the main molecular event in most sporadic RCC and the treatment of advanced RCC has been revolutionized by targeted therapy with drugs that block angiogenesis. These drugs are now in first line in metastatic sporadic RCC and have shown promising results for RCC, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and malignant pheochromocytomas in VHL patients.", "journal": "Seminars in cancer biology", "date": "2012-06-05", "authors": ["St\u00e9phaneRichard", "BettyGardie", "SophieCouv\u00e9", "SophieGad"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcancer.2012.05.005"}

The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic efficacy of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], an endogenous peptide hormone, in human prostate cancer xenografts.\nHuman LNCaP prostate cancer cells were injected into the flank of athymic mice and tumors were treated with Ang-(1-7) for 54 days. Tumor growth and angiogenesis were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot hybridization.\nAng-(1-7) markedly reduced the volume and wet weight of LNCaP xenograft tumors. Histological analysis of tumor sections from saline-treated mice showed increased Ki67 immunoreactivity and enhanced phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 compared to tumors from Ang-(1-7)-treated mice, suggesting that the heptapeptide reduces cell proliferation. Intratumoral vessel density was decreased in Ang-(1-7)-treated mice with an associated reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), suggesting that the heptapeptide attenuates vascularization by reducing angiogenic factors. Ang-(1-7) administration markedly increased the soluble fraction of VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1), with a concomitant reduction in VEGF receptors 1 and 2. sFlt-1 serves as a decoy receptor that traps VEGF and PlGF, making the ligands unavailable to membrane-bound VEGF receptors and preventing activation of pro-angiogenic signaling.\nThe decrease in PlGF and VEGF coupled with the increase in sFlt-1 suggests that Ang-(1-7) may serve as a novel anti-angiogenic therapy for prostate cancer. Further, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action by Ang-(1-7) may limit angiogenic resistance that occurs with VEGF inhibitors or receptor blockers.", "journal": "The Prostate", "date": "2012-05-31", "authors": ["BhavaniKrishnan", "Frank MTorti", "Patricia EGallagher", "E AnnTallant"], "doi": "10.1002/pros.22540"}

Running training affected on the morphology, sympathetic tone and vascularization of BAT, independently of the duration of the stimulus. Functionally, the weak increase in the thermogenesis (no difference in UCP-1), the increased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and the membrane localization of MCT-1 suggest a new function of BAT. Visceral fat increased the expression of the FOXC2, 48 h after last training session and some clusters of UCP-1 paucilocular and multilocular adipocytes appeared.\nExercise seemed a weakly effective stimulus for BAT thermogenesis, but surprisingly, without the supposed metabolically hypoactive effects.

{"title": "Angiogenesis in neuroendocrine tumors: therapeutic applications.", "abstract": "The considerable research efforts devoted to the understanding of the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis have resulted in the development of targeted anti-angiogenic therapies and finally in their introduction in clinical practice. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which are characterized by a high vascular supply and a strong expression of VEGF-A, one of the most potent pro-angiogenic factors, are an attractive indication for these new treatments. However, several lines of evidence show that the dense vascular networks associated with low-grade NETs are more likely to be a marker of differentiation than a marker of aggressiveness, as in other epithelial tumors. These observations form the basis for the so-called 'neuroendocrine paradox', according to which the most vascularized are the most differentiated and the less angiogenic NETs. This must be kept in mind when discussing the role of anti-angiogenic strategies in the treatment of NETs. Nevertheless, several targeted therapies, with direct or indirect anti-angiogenic properties, including anti-VEGF antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib) and mTOR inhibitors (everolimus), have recently proven to be of clinical benefit. In addition, some drugs already used in NET treatment, such as somatostatin analogues and interferon-\u03b1, may also have anti-angiogenic properties. The main challenges for the next future are to validate biomarkers for the selection of patients and the prediction of their response to refine the indications of anti-angiogenic targeted therapies and to overcome the mechanisms of resistance, which explain the limited duration of action of most of these treatments.", "journal": "Neuroendocrinology", "date": "2012-04-28", "authors": ["Jean-YvesScoazec"], "doi": "10.1159/000338371"}

Tumor vasculature, in particular, exhibits special morphological and functional features, partly due to the peculiarity of tumor-derived ECs (TECs). This is of great importance for the discovery of selective molecular targets potentially suitable to interfere with tumor growth and spread. In normal ECs, proangiogenic calcium signaling is mediated by different calcium channels, mainly TRPs and Orai, that could play a pivotal role in physiological angiogenesis. They are regulated through multiple mechanisms, involving their interaction with bioactive lipids (arachidonic acid and its metabolites), nitrosylation, sulfhydration, phosphorylation, cytoskeleton-mediated membrane trafficking, and calcium stores depletion. On the other hand, proangiogenic calcium events in TECs have been investigated only recently and their characterization is still preliminary. ECs obtained from human breast and renal carcinomas (B-TECs and R-TECs respectively) display altered calcium signals, which are associated with modified expression and function of TRP channels.

This case series describes our experience in the treatment of benign esophagorespiratory fistula in 12 adults. A retrospective review of case records of 12 patients with benign esophagorespiratory fistula was done. There were eight tracheoesophageal fistulae and four bronchoesophageal fistulae. Among them, four fistulae were congenital, one was secondary to corrosive injury, three were due to foreign body (dentures), one was secondary to erosion because of prolonged endotracheal intubation, one was secondary to penetrating trauma, and two were infective in etiology. Of the 12 patients, there were nine males and three females. The mean age of presentation was 30.16 years (range 15-53 years). Nine patients had a definitive surgical intervention. The esophageal end of the fistula was managed by primary closure of the esophageal defect and reinforcement with pleural or intercostal muscle flap or a subtotal esophagectomy. The respiratory end of the fistula was dealt with by primary closure of the defect or by a novel technique of neomembranous airway formation, whereby the tracheal defect was closed with the help of a vascularized patch of the esophageal wall. The technique of this neomembranous airway formation is described in detail, and to our knowledge, this is the first time that this technique is being reported in the English literature. This technique is a novel method for definitive repair and can be considered as an option for repair of esophagorespiratory fistula with large defects.", "journal": "Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus", "date": "2012-04-11", "authors": ["GDeshpande", "ISamarasam", "SBanerjee", "R BGnanamuthu", "SChandran", "GMathew"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1442-2050.2012.01347.x"}

After tooth extraction, the sockets were augmented with Bio-Oss collagen or non-augmented. At implant placement after 4 or 12\u00a0weeks bone biopsies were obtained. Within the specimens the osteogenic and endothelial potential of mesenchymal cells was analyzed in the provisional matrix using immunohistochemical analysis with three monoclonal antibodies Cbfa1/Runx2, Osteocalcin (OC), and CD31. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient, and the two-factorial analysis for repeated measurements.\nOf the 65 extraction sockets, 25 (13 non-augmented, 12 augmented) sites after 4\u00a0weeks healing time and 40 (19 non-augmented, 21 augmented) sites after 12\u00a0weeks healing time were involved in the study. No signs of acute or chronic inflammation were noted in any specimens. After 4\u00a0weeks, a median amount of 56% (10-85%) of Cbfa1 positive cells and a median amount of cells expressing OC of 21% (5-42%) were measured. A median CD31 score of 5 was observed. After 12\u00a0weeks, a median amount of 61% (19-90%) positive cells expressed by Cbfa1/Runx2 staining a median amount of OC positive cells of 9% (2-17%) was measured. The results at 12\u00a0weeks revealed a median score of CD31 positive cells of 3.\nOsteoblastic activity in the provisional matrix was highest after 4\u00a0weeks of healing period. The active zone of bone formation is found in the apical region of the extraction socket during the early healing phase, shifting to the coronal region after 12\u00a0weeks. A peak of osteoblast activity within the first weeks is followed by a reduction in mature osteoblasts with osteoblasts remaining in an inactive stage. The vascularity changed in likewise fashion to the maturation of osteoblasts within the observation period.

A MEDLINE\u00ae and PubMed\u00ae search was conducted for articles related to tissue engineering of the bladder, with special focus on the cells and biomaterials employed as well as the microenvironment, vascularisation and innervation strategies used.\nOver the last decade, advances in tissue engineering technology have laid the groundwork for the development of a biological substitute for bladder tissue that can support storage of urine and restore physiologic voiding. Although many researchers have been able to demonstrate the formation of engineered tissue with a structure similar to that of native bladder tissue, restoration of physiologic voiding using these constructs has never been demonstrated. The main issues hindering the development of larger contractile tissues that allow physiologic voiding include the development of correct muscle alignment, proper innervation and vascularization.\nTissue engineering of a construct that will support the contractile properties that allow physiologic voiding is a complex process.

To overcome the limitations from autologous grafts, a sheep model has been established recently, which is characterized by the development of an independent axial vascularization of a bioartificial construct, permitting microsurgical transplantation. To engineer independently axially vascularized bone tissue in the sheep arteriovenous (AV)-loop model, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), without and in combination with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2), were harvested and directly autotransplanted in combination with \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate-hydroxyapatite (\u03b2-TCP-HA) granules into sheep in this study. After explantation after 12\u2009weeks, histological and immunohistochemical evaluation revealed newly formed bone in both groups. An increased amount of bone area was obtained using directly autotransplanted MSCs with rhBMP-2 stimulation. Osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells were detected adjacent to the newly formed bone, revealing an active bone remodelling process. Directly autotransplanted MSCs can be found close to the \u03b2-TCP-HA granules and are contributing to bone formation. Over time, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) imaging confirmed the dense vascularization arising from the AV-loop. This study shows de novo engineering of independently axially vascularized transplantable bone tissue in clinically significant amounts, using directly autotransplanted MSCs and rhBMP-2 stimulation in about 12\u2009weeks in the sheep AV-loop model.

When choosing which of the multiple musculofascial abdominal wall planes provides the most durable repair, there is little guidance. We hypothesized that the retro-rectus plane would reduce recurrence rates versus intraperitoneal placement due to greater surface area contact of mesh with well-vascularized tissue.\nForty-nine of the 80 patients in an ongoing, prospective, multicenter study of contaminated ventral hernia repairs (RICH study, NCT00617357) achieved fascial closure after musculofascial centralization and reinforcement with non-crosslinked porcine acellular dermal matrix (Strattice\u2122, LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ) and were retrospectively analyzed. The Strattice was placed in the retro-rectus position in 23 patients and in the intraperitoneal position in 26.\nSubjects were comparable in age, obesity, prior wound infection, presence of a stoma, and infected mesh removal (p > 0.05). More smokers were present in the intraperitoneal group (p = 0.02). Retro-rectus defects were significantly wider and had larger area than the intraperitoneal repairs. At the 1-year follow-up, 44 (90%) of patients were available for review. There was no difference in wound infections, seromas, or hematomas. Recurrent hernias were identified in 10% of retro-rectus repairs and 30% of intraperitoneal repairs (p = 0.14).\nIn this retrospective analysis of a prospective multicenter study of large, contaminated ventral hernias, despite a larger hernia defect in the retro-rectus group, placement of the mesh in the retro-rectus compartment resulted in a similar recurrence rate to intraperitoneal mesh placement.

{"title": "Accelerated wound closure in a diabetic mouse model after exposure to phenanthrenequinone.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to be important in wound healing by promoting angiogenesis (also mentioned by Ushio-Fukai and Nakamura). Likewise ROS have been implicated by toxicological studies as a primary mechanism of air pollution-associated morbidity. We sought to determine how exposure to a reactive diesel exhaust chemical (phenanthrenequinone [PQ]), which promotes formation of ROS and is considered an air pollutant, would affect wound healing. Since wound healing is compromised in diabetic (db) individuals, we examined the effects of PQ on wound healing in a db mouse model.\ndb mice consumed PQ-containing chow for a short period (2 weeks) before wounding and through generations. Wound closure rates and wound vascularization were evaluated 10 days after wounding. The effects of PQ on endothelial cell proliferation and ROS generation in vitro were also measured.\ndb mice exposed to short-term PQ and PQ-exposed first-generation db mice demonstrated the highest closure rates, significantly better than control db mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a higher concentration of PQ in sera of db mice coincides with the higher rate of closure. PQ was also shown to produce ROS in cell culture and stimulate endothelial cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations. Second- and third-generation db mice exposed to PQ did not show improved wound healing.\nThis study suggests that the free radical-generating air pollutant PQ enhances wound closure in the db mouse model possibly by stimulating angiogenesis, as suggested by in vitro results. We speculate that PQ may increase oxidation levels systemically and therefore help modulate inflammation at the wound site. Alternatively, antioxidant mechanisms recruited for wound healing may interfere with PQ metabolism and elimination as it accumulates in sera. Generational resistance to improve wound healing in PQ-exposed db mice could also be due to disturbances in metabolism caused by continuous exposure.

Our current tissue-engineering methods result in three-dimensional (3D) muscle constructs that generate tension but do not advance phenotypically beyond neonatal characteristics. To develop to an adult phenotype, innervation and vascularization of the construct must occur. In this study, 3D muscle constructs were implanted into the hindlimb of a rat, along the sciatic nerve, with the sural nerve isolated, transected and sutured to the construct to encourage innervation. Aortic ring anchors were sutured to the tendons of the biceps femoris muscle so that the construct would move dynamically with the endogenous muscle. After 1\u2009week in vivo, the constructs were explanted, evaluated for force production and stained for muscle, nerve and collagen markers. Implanted muscle constructs showed a developing capillary system, an epimysium-like outer layer of connective tissue and an increase in myofibre content. The beginning of \u03b1-bungarotoxin clustering suggests that neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) could form on the implanted muscle, given more time in vivo.

{"title": "Regulation of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism by ras.", "abstract": "High glucose uptake is a characteristic of most metastatic tumors and activation of Ras signaling in immortalized cells increases glycolytic flux into lactate, de novo nucleic acid synthesis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increases NADH shuttling, oxygen consumption and uncoupling of ATP synthase from the proton gradient. Fructose-2,6- bisphosphate, C-Myc, HIF1\u03b1 and AKT each have been found to be key regulators of glycolysis and to be controlled by Ras signaling, and there is abundant evidence for cross-talk between these regulators. The reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism by Ras enables an integrated activation of energetic and anabolic pathways via the redox state of NADH that is required for the survival and growth of neoplastic cells in poorly vascularized tumors. Several small molecule antagonists specific for essential metabolic enzymes have been found to be selectively toxic to Ras-transformed cells as opposed to wild-type cells, indicating that this metabolic reprogramming and addiction may have utility for the development of anti-neoplastic agents.", "journal": "Current pharmaceutical biotechnology", "date": "2011-12-29", "authors": ["JChesney", "STelang"], "doi": "10.2174/1389201011314030002"}
{"title": "Tissue engineering based on electrochemical desorption of an RGD-containing oligopeptide.", "abstract": "This paper describes a non-invasive approach for efficient detachment of cells adhered to a gold substrate via a specific oligopeptide. Detachment is effected by an electrical stimulus. The oligopeptide contains cysteine, which spontaneously forms a gold-thiolate bond on a gold surface. This chemical adsorption reaches > 95% equilibrium within 10 min after immersion of a gold-coated substrate in a solution containing the peptide. The peptide is reversibly desorbed from the surface within 5 min of application of a negative electrical potential. By taking advantage of this simple adsorption and desorption mechanism, cells can be grown on an oligopeptide-functionalized gold surface and can be efficiently detached as single cells or cell sheets by application of a negative electrical potential. This approach was also applied to the surface of gold-coated microrods. Capillary-like microchannels were formed in collagen gel by transferring endothelial cells to the internal surfaces of the microchannels. During subsequent perfusion culture, the enveloped endothelial cells migrated into the collagen gel and formed luminal structures, which sprouted from the microchannels. This technique has the potential to provide a fundamental tool for the engineering of thick cell sheets as well as vascularized tissues and organs.", "journal": "Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine", "date": "2011-12-14", "authors": ["NaotoMochizuki", "TakahiroKakegawa", "TatsuyaOsaki", "NasserSadr", "Nezamoddin NKachouie", "HiroakiSuzuki", "JunjiFukuda"], "doi": "10.1002/term.519"}

In this study we provided morphologic evidence of vascularization by using power Doppler ultrasound to correlate the clinicopathologic features of tumorigenesis, ER/c-erbB-2 expression, and tumor grade in invasive breast carcinoma.\nThree indices (VI, vascularization index; FI, flow index; VFI, vascularization flow index) were used to analyze 3D power Doppler ultrasound images from 168 patients with malignant breast carcinoma and to correlate their clinicopathologic features.\nVI (the mean tumor vascularity) was correlated with ER negativity (p < 0.0029) and VFI (the overall perfusion) was correlated with ER positivity (p < 0.0029). HER2 positivity was statistically significantly correlated with tumor vasculature (VI, VFI) and tumor size/volume. FI (the mean blood flow volume) was significantly correlated with tumor size/volume, but VI was not. The univariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed the reverse correlations between ER expression and tumor vascularity, and positive correlations between HER2 expression and tumor vascularity as well as tumor volume.\nThis morphologic evidence of vascularization is correlated with tumor angiogenesis and ER/c-erbB-2 co-expression, which could clarify the biology of breast cancer.", "journal": "Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)", "date": "2011-11-30", "authors": ["Shou-TungChen", "Shou-JenKuo", "Hwa-KoonWu", "Li-ShengChen", "Dar-RenChen"], "doi": "10.1007/s12282-011-0317-y"}

The resection, cutting and implant placement in the fibula were virtually planned. Cutting/drilling guides were 3D printed, and the suprastructure was computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing milled.\nFor the first operation, the implants were inserted in the fibula, and the position was registered by an optical scanning technique that defined the final planning of the suprastructure. For the second operation, the osteoradionecrosis was resected, the fibula was harvested and, with the denture fixed on the preinserted implants, placed in the mandibula guided by the occlusion.\nIt was possible to plan a mandibular reconstruction with immediate prosthetic loading completely by 3D virtual techniques.", "journal": "Head & neck", "date": "2011-10-26", "authors": ["Rutger HSchepers", "Gerry MRaghoebar", "ArjanVissink", "Lars ULahoda", "W JoerdVan der Meer", "Jan LRoodenburg", "HarryReintsema", "Max JWitjes"], "doi": "10.1002/hed.21922"}
{"title": "Towards the generation of patient-specific patches for cardiac repair.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases represent the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Millions of people are affected by such diseases in the industrialized countries, with hundreds of thousands new cases diagnosed every year. Among cardiac diseases, heart failure is the most common end-stage pathology, leading to impaired cardiac output and cardiac performance as a result of the irreversible loss of contractile cardiomyocytes. Tissue engineering holds the promise to provide personalized solutions to the problem of cardiac muscle repair. Indeed, the identification of little reservoirs of stem and progenitor cells within every body district opened new perspectives to the setup of patient-specific protocols for cardiac diseases. Nonetheless, the results of the first pre-clinical and clinical trials in which adult stem/progenitor cells were adopted pointed at the route of delivery to the injured organ as well as at the cell source as the main issues for cardiac tissue engineers. In fact, when adult stem cells were directly injected into the myocardium or delivered through bloodstream to the heart, no or few cells could be found engrafted within host tissue few days after the administration. Renewed enthusiasm was generated by the techniques set up to enrich cardiomyocytes obtained by embryonic stem cells and by the recent disclosure of the protocols to obtain reprogrammed pluripotent cells or reprogrammed cardiomyocytes out of patients' own somatic cells. In this context, additional efforts to setup efficient systems to deliver stem cells to the injured site are required. The application of forefront technologies to fabricate synthetic and hybrid scaffolds to be employed as cell delivery systems and the acknowledgement that surface physical, mechanical, chemical properties can exert specific effects on stem cells per se prompted new enthusiasm in the field. In this respect, a cardiac-specific scaffold should be able to comply with cardiac muscle architecture, be deformable as to indulge and possibly sustain cardiac contraction. As expected, such a scaffold should favor stem cell electromechanical coupling with host tissue, while promoting the vascularization of the newly-formed tissue.", "journal": "Stem cell reviews and reports", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["GiancarloForte", "StefaniaPagliari", "FrancescaPagliari", "MitsuhiroEbara", "PaoloDi Nardo", "TakaoAoyagi"], "doi": "10.1007/s12015-011-9325-8"}

Porosity is essential to the performance of a material that is proposed to be used as an implantable osseous scaffold. Scaffolds provide a three dimensional support and template to osseous integration and vascularization. Combining the porosity of a scaffold with the ability of the scaffold material to deliver therapeutic ions to the site of implantation goes some way towards developing an ideal bone graft. A series of strontium-doped zinc silicate (Ca-Sr-Na-Zn-Si) glass ceramics scaffoldswere developed, whose porosity was measured to be between 93% and 96%, which is advantageous in terms of osseous integration and vascularization. The levels of Zn(2+) and Sr(2+) detected as a result of degradation of the crystalline phases were found to be 1.4-600 parts per million (ppm) and 0-583 ppm, respectively. The levels detected correlate well with the levels of Sr(2+) and Zn(2+)ions typically associated with clinical benefits, including antibacterial efficacy, osteoblastic differentiation and impaired osteoclastic resorption.", "journal": "Journal of biomaterials applications", "date": "2011-09-20", "authors": ["MarkLooney", "HelenO'Shea", "DanielBoyd"], "doi": "10.1177/0885328211413621"}
{"title": "Outcomes of tethered cord repair with a layered soft tissue closure.", "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated the benefit of releasing symptomatic tethered cords; however, complications such as seroma, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and infection continue to plague these patients. We propose that composite tissue closure of tethered cord repairs yields superior outcomes and that a collaborative effort between neurosurgery and plastic surgery may result in enhanced structural and functional results.\nThis is a retrospective study comprised of consecutive patients with tethered cord syndrome by 2 neurosurgeons and 2 plastic surgeons between 1994 and 2008 at a single institution. All consecutive patients who underwent tethered cord release by neurosurgery and subsequent composite tissue closure with fascial and musculofascial flaps by plastic surgery were included. Data were collected by retrospective chart review and analyzed using parametric methods.\nA total of 86 consecutive patients were included in this study, with follow-up ranged from 12 to 144 months (average follow-up, 29 months). There were no statistical differences in follow-up time, comorbidities, or surgeon when comparing hospital readmission or reoperation. There was no statistical difference in complications when comparing the different flap closures. We had a 1.2% infection rate, a 4.7% readmission rate, and a 3.5% reoperation rate.\nWe believe that local soft tissue rearrangement improves the closure by providing an additional layer of vascularized tissue between the skin and the spinal cord. We believe our series represents a significant sample size compared with those previously reported for an experience that achieves multilayered soft tissue closure after tethered cord repair. Our results support the idea that neurosurgeons should consider consultation of plastic surgeons when treating patients with tethered cord syndrome surgically.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2011-09-17", "authors": ["BenjaminLevi", "Kristoffer BSugg", "Samuel CLien", "Steven JKasten", "Karin MMuraszko", "Cormac OMaher", "Steven RBuchman"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e31822f9ada"}

{"title": "A reliable method for treatment of nonhealing ulcers in the hindfoot and midfoot region in diabetic patients: reconstruction with abductor digiti minimi muscle flap.", "abstract": "The foot has a unique anatomic composition and a perfect architecture, which is necessary for mobilization. However, this complex structure is also responsible for healing problems in foot reconstruction. After 25 years of experience in diabetic foot surgery practice, we observed that some hindfoot ulcers are like an iceberg in that they have much more involvement in the plantar fat pad than the skin, and the lateral midfoot region is a common site for ulcer formation. Also the fifth tarsometatarsal joint region is a prominent anatomic structure vulnerable to repetitive trauma and ulcer formation that may easily spread to other parts of the foot. These ulcers should be reconstructed with well-vascularized tissues such as muscle flaps after debridement. Between 2003 and 2010, 17 diabetic patients with foot ulcers, involving bone and joint, were reconstructed with abductor digiti minimi muscle flap. When it is needed, the flap is covered with a small split-thickness skin graft. In all cases, complete healing was achieved. The muscle flap functioned well as a versatile and shock absorbent coverage without recurrence of the ulcer during a mean follow-up period of around 2 years. Diabetic foot ulcers should be evaluated and treated individually depending on their location and affected tissue composition. The most appropriate reconstructive option should be selected for each lesion. The abductor digiti minimi muscle flap is extremely useful for the reconstruction of small- to moderate-sized defects that have exposed bone, joint, or tendons in the hindfoot and lateral plantar midfoot.", "journal": "Annals of plastic surgery", "date": "2011-07-26", "authors": ["MuzafferAltindas", "MehmetCeber", "AliKilic", "MesutSarac", "MuratDiyarbakirli", "SemihBaghaki"], "doi": "10.1097/SAP.0b013e318228e3b2"}

The qualitative analysis has shown that both defects presented the same histologic characteristics so that a better organized, more mature, and well-vascularized bone tissue was noticed in the eighth week.
