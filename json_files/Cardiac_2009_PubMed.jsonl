{"title": "[Pleiotropic effects of erythropoietin].", "abstract": "Since the isolation and purification of erythropoietin (EPO) in 1977, the essential role of EPO for mature red blood cell production has been well established. The cloning of the EPO gene and production of recombinant human EPO led to the widespread use of EPO in treating patients with anaemia. In addition to stimulating erythropoiesis, EPO has several extrahaematopoietic functions including neuro-, reno- and caridioprotection. EPO receptor (EPOR) expression is also found in endothelial, brain, cardiovascular and other tissues, although at levels considerably lower than that of erythroid progenitor cells. This review discusses the survival and proliferative activity of EPO that extends beyond erythroid progenitor cells. Loss of EpoR expression in mouse models provides evidence for the role of endogenous EPO signalling in nonhaematopoietic tissue during development or for tissue maintenance and/or repair. Determining the extent and distribution of receptor expression provides insights into the potential protective activity of EPO in brain, heart and other nonhaematopoietic tissues. The administration of recombinant EPO reduced brain injury associated with stroke, blunt trauma, and prevented ischaemic injury in the spinal cord. Studies suggest that EPO also protects heart tissues by enhancing angiogenesis, attenuating myocardial ischaemic/reperfusion injury, and attenuating the effects of cytotoxic drugs. EPO protects against ischaemic/reperfusion injury by inhibition of apoptosis and hypoxia, limiting infarct size and preserving myocardium.", "journal": "Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti", "date": "2010-03-18", "authors": ["PetarKes", "NikolinaBasi\u0107-Juki\u0107", "VesnaFuri\u0107-Cunko"], "doi": null}

Heterogeneity in protein phosphorylation may be larger in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as it may be caused by multiple mutations in genes encoding different sarcomeric proteins. Moreover, HCM is characterized by asymmetric remodelling of the heart. In the present study we assessed if local differences in sarcomeric protein phosphorylation are more evident in primary HCM or DCM than in non-failing donors. Thereto, phosphorylation of the two main target proteins of the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway, troponin I (cTnI) and myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) was analysed in different parts in the free left ventricular wall of end-stage failing HCM and DCM patients and donors obtained during transplant surgery. Intra-patient variability in protein phosphorylation within tissue samples of approximately 2 g wet weight was comparable between donor, HCM and DCM samples and could partly be attributed to the precision of the technique.

Moreover the identity of the specific chemical ingredients in OS leaves responsible for these pharmacological effects are unknown. Since OS leaves are rich in essential oil (EO). Therefore the present study was conducted to investigate the anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidative activities of EO extracted from OS leaves in rats fed with high cholesterol (HC) diet. EO was extracted by the hydrodistillation method and the chemical constituents were then identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The experiment was performed in Male Wistar rats fed with 2.5 g%(w/w) of cholesterol diet for seven weeks. During the last 3 weeks, rats were daily fed with EO. The results showed that phenyl propanoid compounds including eugenol and methyl eugenol were the major constituents of EO. EO suppressed the high serum lipid profile and atherogenic index as well as serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase MB subunit without significant effect on high serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase in rats fed with HC diet. In addition, EO was found to decrease the high levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) without impacting catalase (CAT) in the cardiac tissue while in the liver, it decreased high level of TBARS without significantly effecting GPx, SOD and CAT.

{"title": "Surveillance for infectious salmon anaemia virus HPR0 in marine Atlantic salmon farms across Scotland.", "abstract": "Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is a serious and commercially important pathogen of Atlantic salmon. Multiple viruses have been defined based on a highly polymorphic region (HPR) of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein encoded by genomic segment 6. The viruses causing disease outbreaks in farms to date all have deletions in this region with respect to a putative ancestral variant with a longer HPR (HPR0). The presence of HPR0 nucleic acid has been detected in many countries including Scotland, where it has mostly been associated with healthy wild and farmed fish. Pathogenic ISAVs appear to have been derived from HPR0 ancestors on multiple independent occasions, which suggests that the presence of HPR0 could represent a risk factor in the re-emergence of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) disease. In order to better understand this potential risk factor, anonymous samples of gill and heart tissues from marine Atlantic salmon farms throughout Scotland were collected and screened for the presence of ISAV RNA. Since it has not been possible to isolate HPR0 in conventional ISA-permissive cell cultures, a sensitive real-time RT-PCR method was employed for the detection of viral RNA. DNA sequencing was carried out on the positive samples to determine their HPR sequence. ISAV RNA was detected in 6 samples originating from 4 different locations and sequence analysis indicated the viruses were of the HPR0 type.

The Troponin was detected qualitatively when a specimen contains Troponin I (cTnI) above the 99th percentile (TnI >0.5 ng/ml). The Total cholesterol (TC), High density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL), Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and Triacyl glycerol levels (TG) were also analysed and low density lipoprotein level (LDL) was calculated using Friedelwald formula.\nSubjects with chest pain and positive Troponin test (with confirmed cardiac event) were found to have significantly elevated levels of TC, TG , LDL and significantly reduced HDL levels when compared to the subjects who had only chest pain (Negative Troponin) and healthy controls.\nTraditional lipid profile levels still can be used in screening populations to identify the subjects with high risk of developing cardiac event which is identified by highly sensitive and specific positive Troponin test.", "journal": "Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ)", "date": "2010-01-15", "authors": ["L D RDe Silva", "AKumar", "BSathian"], "doi": "10.3126/kumj.v7i3.2735"}

We used methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases (AciI, BstUI, HpaII, and HinP1I) to assess 5-LOX DNA methylation in brain and heart tissue samples from young (2 months) and old (22 months) mice. We also measured mRNA content for 5-LOX and the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3a. In young mice, the 5-LOX mRNA content was significantly greater in the heart compared to the brain; 5-LOX DNA methylation was lower, except in the AciI assay in which it was higher in the heart. Aging decreased 5-LOX mRNA content in the heart and increased it in the brain. Aging also increased 5-LOX DNA methylation and this effect was site- (i.e., enzyme) and tissue-specific. Generally, DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA content was lower in the brain regions compared to the heart; the only effect of aging was observed in the mRNA content of DNMT3a, which was decreased in the heart of old mice. These results indicate a complex tissue-specific and aging-dependent interplay between the DNA methylation system and 5-LOX mRNA content.

The mechanism by which LVH develops is not well understood nor are biomarkers of it well characterized. Natriuretic peptides are important regulators of cardiac growth, blood volume, and arterial pressure and may be useful biomarkers of LVH and hemodynamic changes that precede it. We measured amino-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NTproANP), amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations in serum and plasma, as well as transcripts in left ventricular heart tissue for atrial natriuretic peptide precursor (Nppa), brain natriuretic peptide precursor (Nppb), and myosin heavy chain-beta (Myh7) as potential biomarkers of LVH induced by a PPARalpha/gamma dual agonist in Sprague-Dawley rats. We used magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and hemodynamics to identify structural and functional cardiovascular changes related to the biomarkers. Heart-to-brain weight ratios (HW:BrW) were correlated with NTproANP, NTproBNP, and cTnI concentrations in serum as well as fold change in expression of Nppa and Nppb. LVH was characterized by increased left ventricular wall thickness and inner diameter, increased cardiac output, decreased arterial blood pressure, and increased heart rate.

Whether age of donors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) affects its ability to repair the senescent heart tissue is unknown. In the present study, MSCs from young (2 months) and aged (18 months) green fluorescent protein expressing C57BL/6 mice were characterized with p16(INK4a) and \u03b2-gal associated senescence. Myocardial infarction was produced in 18-month-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice transplanted with MSCs from young and aged animals in the border of the infarct region.

A decline in the tube-forming ability on Matrigel was also observed in aged MSCs as well as down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) compared to young cells. Mice transplanted with young MSCs exhibited significant improvement in their left ventricle (LV) systolic and diastolic function as demonstrated by dp/dt(max) , dp/dt(min) , P(max) .

The hypoxia was simulated in a hypobaric chamber at 428 torr. Tolerance was determined according to a previous protocol. Arginase activity was measured in lung and heart tissues, and the expression levels were determined by a (RT-PCR) assay in lung tissue. Results showed that the intolerants rats had lower body weight, higher hematocrit (Hct) (74 +/- 4% vs. 61 +/- 2%, p < 0.05), higher values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) (183 +/- 3.7 mmHg vs. 147 +/- 5.4 mmHg, p < 0.05), and higher arginase activity. In addition, RT-PCR analysis from lung tissue showed an overexpression of arginase II in the intolerant group (p < 0.01). However, tolerants had similar values as the NX group (p = ns). Further, a correlation was found between arginase activity and SBP in the heart (r(2) = 0.596, p < 0.001).

Hypertension was induced in rats (LN group) by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 40 mg*kg(-1)*day(-1)). Provinol (40 mg*kg(-1)*day(-1)) was applied during developing hypertension (LNPF4 group) and sustained hypertension (LNPF7/3 group).

Concerning qualitative properties of the enzyme, Provinol induced different effects on the ATP- and Na(+)-binding sites of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. The ATP-binding site was impaired by Provinol, as indicated by increased K(m) value (by 52% in LNPF4 vs. LN), suggesting worsened utilization of substrate by the enzyme. In sustained hypertension, however, Provinol had no effect on the ATP-binding site, as indicated by unchanged K(m) value (LNPF7/3 vs. LN). On the other hand, the Na(+)-binding site was protected by Provinol, as suggested by decreased K(Na) value (by 72% in LNPF4 and 69% in LNPF7/3 vs. LN), indicating an increased affinity of the enzyme for sodium.

Tensile stiffness of the sintered PCL strut was in the range of 0.43+/-0.15MPa when a laser power of 3W and scanning speed of 150 in s(-1) was used. A series of compressive mechanical characterizations was performed on the parametric scaffold design and an empirical formula was presented to predict the compressive stiffness of the scaffold as a function of total porosity. In this work, the porosity of the scaffold was selected to be 85%, with micropores (40-100mum) throughout the scaffold. The compressive stiffness of the scaffold was 345kPa. The feasibility of using the scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering was investigated by culturing C2C12 myoblast cells in vitro for 21days. Fluorescence images showed cells were located throughout the scaffold. High density of cells at 1.2x10(6)cellsml(-1) was recorded after 4days of culture. Fusion and differentiation of C2C12 were observed as early as 6days in vitro and was confirmed with myosin heavy chain immunostaining after 11days of cell culture. A steady population of cells was then maintained throughout 21days of culturing. This work demonstrated the feasibility of tailoring the mechanical property of the scaffold for soft tissue engineering using CASTS and SLS. The macroarchitecture of the scaffold can be modified efficiently to fabricate scaffolds with different macropore sizes or changing the elemental cell design in CASTS.

Here, we show that the prolonged intramyocardial expression of VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-B(167) on adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery determined a marked improvement in cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats, by promoting cardiac contractility, preserving viable cardiac tissue, and preventing remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) over time. Consistent with this functional outcome, animals treated with both factors showed diminished fibrosis and increased contractile myocardium, which were more pronounced after expression of the selective VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) ligand VEGF-B, in the absence of significant induction of angiogenesis. We found that cardiomyocytes expressed VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin-1 and that, in particular, VEGFR-1 was specifically up-regulated in hypoxia and on exposure to oxidative stress. VEGF-B exerted powerful antiapoptotic effect in both cultured cardiomyocytes and after myocardial infarction in vivo. Finally, VEGFR-1 activation by VEGF-B was found to elicit a peculiar gene expression profile proper of the compensatory, hypertrophic response, consisting in activation of alphaMHC and repression of betaMHC and skeletal alpha-actin, and an increase in SERCA2a, RYR, PGC1alpha, and cardiac natriuretic peptide transcripts, both in cultured cardiomyocytes and in infarcted hearts.

Later, it was also shown that the proposed mechanism of adaptation of GJs is consistent with known electrophysiology of GJs. In the present article, we show that a pair of cardiac cell models coupled by dynamic, voltage-sensitive GJs exhibits bistable behavior under certain conditions. Three kinds of cell pairs are considered: (1) a Noble-Noble cell pair that represents adjacent cells in Purkinje network, (2) a pair of DiFranceso-Noble cells that represents adjacent SA nodal cells, and (3) a model of Noble cell coupled to Luo-Rudy cell model, which represents an interacting pair of a Purkinje fiber and a ventricular myocyte. Bistability is demonstrated in all the three cases. We suggest that this bistability might be an underlying factor behind cardiac memory. Focused analysis of a pair of Noble cell models showed that bistability is obtained only when the properties of GJs \"match\" with the properties of the pair of cells that is coupled by the GJs.

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of a PAI-1 deficiency (PAI-1(-/-)) on the spontaneous development of cardiac fibrosis. PAI-1(-/-) mice developed pervasive cardiac fibrosis spontaneously with aging, and these mice displayed progressively distorted cardiac architecture and markedly reduced cardiac function. To mechanistically elucidate the role of PAI-1 in cardiac fibrosis, 12-week-old mice were chosen to study the biologic events leading to fibrosis. Although fibrosis was not observed at this early age, PAI-1(-/-) hearts presented with enhanced inflammation, along with increased microvascular permeability and hemorrhage. A potent fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), was markedly enhanced in PAI-1(-/-) heart tissue. Furthermore, the expression levels of several relevant proteases associated with tissue remodeling were significantly enhanced in PAI-1(-/-) hearts. These results suggest that PAI-1 is cardioprotective, and functions in maintaining normal microvasculature integrity. Microvascular leakage in PAI-1(-/-) hearts may provoke inflammation, and predispose these mice to cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, a PAI-1 deficiency contributes to the development of cardiac fibrosis by increasing vascular permeability, exacerbating local inflammation, and increasing extracellular matrix remodeling, an environment conducive to accelerated fibrosis.", "journal": "Blood", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["ZhiXu", "Francis JCastellino", "Victoria APloplis"], "doi": "10.1182/blood-2009-09-244962"}

After 30 days of ethanol-exposure, (E) group was divided into four subgroups (N=6/group):(E-E) continued drinking 30% ethanol-solution; (E-NAC) drinking ethanol-solution containing 2g/L NAC; (AB) changed ethanol solution to water; (AB-NAC) changed ethanol to aqueous solution of 2g/L NAC. After 15 days of the E-group division, E-E rats had lower body weight and feed efficiency, as well as higher energy-expenditure resting metabolic rate (RMR)/body weight and VO(2) consumption/surface area. These calorimetric changes were reflected on the cardiac tissue. E-E rats had higher heart weight/body weight ratio and myocardial lipid hydroperoxide (LH), indicating AHD with hypertrophy and oxidative stress. Myocardial superoxide dismutase was higher, whereas glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-peroxidase) was lower in E-E rats than in C. The higher myocardial hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase (OHADH), OHADH/citrate synthase (CS), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/CS in E-E rats indicated higher fatty acid degradation relative to aerobic metabolism predisposing the lipotoxicity. AB rats had lower RMR/body weight than E-E, normalized myocardial oxidative stress, and energy metabolism. E-NAC and AB-NAC had lower RMR/body weight, myocardial LH, LDH/CS, and higher GSH-peroxidase than E-E and AB, respectively, demonstrating lower oxidative stress and higher myocardial carbohydrate oxidation. In conclusion, the present study brought new insights on alcohol consumption and AHD because ethanol-exposure enhanced energy-expenditure and induced a number of calorimetric changes, which were reflected in body weight and myocardial lipotoxicity. NAC preventing ethanol-induced calorimetric changes and reducing myocardial oxidative stress enhanced carbohydrate oxidation, thus optimizing myocardial energy metabolism in both alcoholic and abstinence condition.", "journal": "Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["F\u00e1bio Rodrigues FerreiraSeiva", "Juliana FujiharaAmauchi", "Katiucha Karolina RibeiroRocha", "Geovana XavierEbaid", "GiseleSouza", "Ana Ang\u00e9lica HenriqueFernandes", "Ana CatarinaCataneo", "Ethel Lourenzi BarbosaNovelli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.09.028"}

As a result, alternative approaches such as cell therapy have been suggested to hold potential promise. However, a major obstacle is the optimization of cell delivery to the heart. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of a percutaneous recirculation system for the delivery of cells to the heart.\nOvine fibroblasts were delivered to the ovine heart (3 x 10(7) cells) using the V-Focus system, a \"closed\" recirculatory system that draws blood from the coronary sinus and returns it to the coronary artery via an oxygenator, or intracoronary (IC) infusion, followed by a 2-hour recovery period.

To determine the role of CHF1/Hey2 in pressure overload hypertrophy, we performed ascending aortic banding on wild-type and transgenic mice overexpressing CHF1/Hey2 in the myocardium. We found that both wild-type and transgenic mice developed increased ventricular weight to body weight ratios 1 week after aortic banding. Wild-type mice also developed decreased fractional shortening after 1 week when compared to preoperative echocardiograms and sham-operated controls. Transgenic mice, in comparison, demonstrated preserved fractional shortening. Histological examination of explanted heart tissue demonstrated extensive fibrosis in wild-type hearts, but minimal fibrosis in transgenic hearts. TUNEL staining demonstrated increased apoptosis in the wild-type hearts but not in the transgenic hearts. Exposure of cultured neonatal myocytes from wild-type and transgenic animals to hydrogen peroxide, a potent inducer of apoptosis, demonstrated increased apoptosis in the wild-type cells. Gene Set Analysis of microarray data from wild-type and transgenic hearts 1 week after banding revealed suppression and activation of multiple pathways involving apoptosis, cell signaling, and biosynthesis. These findings demonstrate that CHF1/Hey2 promotes physiological over pathological hypertrophy through suppression of apoptosis and regulation of multiple transcriptional pathways. These findings also suggest that CHF1/Hey2 and its downstream pathways provide a variety of targets for novel heart failure drug discovery, and that genetic polymorphisms in CHF1/Hey2 may affect susceptibility to hypertrophy and heart failure.", "journal": "Omics : a journal of integrative biology", "date": "2009-12-17", "authors": ["ManYu", "YonggangLiu", "FanXiang", "YuxinLi", "DarraghCullen", "RonglihLiao", "Richard PBeyer", "Theodor KBammler", "Michael TChin"], "doi": "10.1089/omi.2009.0086"}

Mice were treated with high or low doses of tigecycline, saline (negative-effect controls), or a previously published regimen of ceftriaxone (positive-effect controls). Infection status was assessed at 3 months after treatment by culture, quantitative ospA real-time PCR, and subcutaneous transplantation of joint and heart tissue into SCID mice. Tissues from all saline-treated mice were culture and ospA PCR positive, tissues from all antibiotic-treated mice were culture negative, and some of the tissues from most of the mice treated with antibiotics were ospA PCR positive, although the DNA marker load was markedly decreased compared to that in saline-treated mice. Antibiotic treatment during the early stage of infection appeared to be more effective than treatment that began during later stages of infection. The viability of noncultivable spirochetes in antibiotic-treated mice (demonstrable by PCR) was confirmed by transplantation of tissue allografts from treated mice into SCID mice, with dissemination of spirochetal DNA to multiple recipient tissues, and by xenodiagnosis, including acquisition by ticks, transmission by ticks to SCID mice, and survival through molting into nymphs and then into adults. Furthermore, PCR-positive heart base tissue from antibiotic-treated mice revealed RNA transcription of several B. burgdorferi genes.

Renal, gastric, and cardiac tissues subjected to genomic analysis of expression in perinatal ERRgamma null mice revealed a characteristic dysregulation of genes involved in transport processes, exemplified by the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kcne2. Consistently, ERRgamma null animals die during the first 72 h of life with elevated serum potassium, reductions in key gastric acid production markers, and cardiac arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals.

To build such tools, several computational methodologies need to be adopted regarding efficiency and reliability. On the other hand improvements apply to the hardware too. State of the art computers, even personal computers, tend to make use of multiple core Central Processing Units. Unfortunately the aforementioned methodologies follow sequential logic, resulting to low efficiency of the working platform.

{"title": "A novel near-infrared voltage-sensitive dye reveals the action potential wavefront orientation at increased depths of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Recently, novel near-infrared (NIR) voltage-sensitive dyes were developed for imaging electrical activity in blood-perfused hearts and for tomographic applications. However, their usefulness for conventional surface mapping is unclear. The spectral shift to the NIR range significantly increases the penetration depth of light into the tissue, thus increasing the intramural volume contributing to the optical action potential (OAP). Here, we characterize both computationally and experimentally the effect of increased penetration depth on the OAP upstroke, the OAP component most sensitive to optical scattering and absorption, and the activation maps. Optical imaging of cardiac electrical activity was performed in isolated rat hearts (n = 5) paced from the LV mid free wall. We used the NIR dye JPW-6033 (excitation at 660nm, acquisition at >695nm). The conventional dye DI-4-ANEPPS (excitation at 532nm, acquisition at 700 DF50nm) was used for comparison. To simulate OAP we utilized a hybrid model that couples light transport equations with the model of electrical propagation. As expected, the switch from DI-4-ANEPPS to JPW-6033 significantly increased the upstroke duration: from 3.95 + or - 0.69ms to 5.39 + or - 0.82 ms, respectively. However, activation maps were largely unaffected. The correlation between the shape of the optical upstroke, and the averaged subsurface wave front orientation was also preserved. The computer simulations are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that despite significant increase in upstroke duration, the novel NIR dyes can be a useful alternative to conventional dyes in surface mapping applications.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

A recent computational study indicated that these electrotonic effects may be strongest in small murine hearts. In the present study, we investigate experimentally how APD is modulated by activation sequence and pacing rate using optical mapping in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. Our results show that following an epicardial point stimulus, a strong correlation exists between epicardial APD and activation time, with decreasing APD for increasing activation time. This effect is preserved for all pacing frequencies (6-14 Hz) investigated in this study. Our experimental results are validated by detailed three-dimensional computer simulations. These simulations also demonstrate a strong transmural APD dependence on activation sequence, which, near the pacing site, is sufficient to mask the intrinsic transmural gradient.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Several studies have shown that the epi-fluorescent optical action potential contains contributions from the sub-epicardium, owing to scattering of photons in tissue. Hybrid electro-optical models have allowed careful quantification of these scattering effects and have lead to a better interpretation of the optical action potential. However, until now, these effects have not been investigated for optically recorded calcium transients. Here, we develop a hybrid model of cardiac dual calcium-voltage epi-fluorescence mapping. This model allows simulating both optical action potentials and optical calcium transients and investigating the effects of photon scattering on their synthesis. We find that optical calcium transients contain contributions from sub-epicardial layers up to 0.8 mm below the epicardium. These lead to significant differences in rise time and activation times between the optically acquired calcium signal and the epicardial intracellular calcium concentration. As has been the case with optically recording action potentials, these results should be taken into account in the interpretation of experimental optical measurements of intracellular calcium.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We sought to evaluate the effect of polarity changes on cardiac capture and the induction of VF. Small swine ( approximately 20.0 kg) were anesthetized and ventilated. The apex of the heart was located via echocar-diography and a CEW probe was fully inserted towards the apex. Echocardiography was used to monitor cardiac contractions to determine cardiac capture. Both the X26 and the 72 microC pulses were delivered at both polarities to test for cardiac capture. Higher charge pulses (375 microC) were then delivered with both polarities to test for VF risk.

{"title": "Selective gamma-ketoaldehyde scavengers protect Nav1.5 from oxidant-induced inactivation.", "abstract": "The cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A, Na(V)1.5) is a key determinant of electrical impulse conduction in cardiac tissue. Acute myocardial infarction leads to diminished sodium channel availability, both because of decreased channel expression and because of greater inactivation of channels already present. Myocardial infarction leads to significant increases in reactive oxygen species and their downstream effectors including lipoxidation products. The effects of reactive oxygen species on Na(V)1.5 function in whole hearts can be modeled in cultured myocytes, where oxidants shift the availability curve of I(Na) to hyperpolarized potentials, decreasing cardiac sodium current at the normal activation threshold. We recently examined potential mediators of the oxidant-induced inactivation and found that one specific lipoxidation product, the isoketals, recapitulated the effects of oxidant on sodium currents. Isoketals are highly reactive gamma-ketoaldehydes formed by the peroxidation of arachidonic acid that covalently modify the lysine residues of proteins. We now confirm that exposure to oxidants induces lipoxidative modification of Na(V)1.5 and that the selective isoketal scavengers block voltage-dependent changes in sodium current by the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide, both in cells heterologously expressing Na(V)1.5 and in a mouse cardiac myocyte cell line (HL-1). Thus, inhibition of this lipoxidative modification pathway is sufficient to protect the sodium channel from oxidant induced inactivation and suggests the potential use of isoketal scavengers as novel therapeutics to prevent arrhythmogenesis during myocardial infarction.", "journal": "Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology", "date": "2009-12-08", "authors": ["TNakajima", "S SDavies", "EMatafonova", "FPotet", "VAmarnath", "K ATallman", "R ASerwa", "N APorter", "J RBalser", "SKupershmidt", "L JRoberts"], "doi": "10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.11.016"}

Compared with pre-dosing, TnT and TnI were markedly increased in the ISO + VASO groups, in which severe histopathological changes including necrosis and vacuolation of muscle fibers were observed. In order to investigate the relationship of biomarker levels with the severity of myocardial injury, Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between C(max) and AUC and necrosis and vacuolation scores in the heart. A high correlation between necrosis and vacuolation in the heart and TnT and TnI levels was noted. These results suggest that TnT and TnI possess high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury in cynomolgus monkeys, and are useful biomarkers for detection of drug-induced myocardial injury in cynomolgus monkeys.", "journal": "The Journal of toxicological sciences", "date": "2009-12-03", "authors": ["HirofumiMinomo", "YusukeTorikai", "TomohiroFurukawa", "HiroshiUchino", "HidetomiKadokura", "KazuhiroNakama", "HiroshiMaeda", "TakeshiKamenosono", "TakayukiSukamoto", "KoichiroFukuzaki", "RyoichiNagata"], "doi": "10.2131/jts.34.589"}

It appears to be involved in the coordinated regulation between oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity of heart tissue when the heart is subjected to oxidative stress in various pathogenic conditions.\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of pretreatment with CoQ10 (100 mg/kg) on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity and cardiac hypertrophy in rats.\nAlbino male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were evenly divided by lottery method into 1 of the following 3 groups: the ISO group (olive oil 2 mL/kg orally for 18 days and ISO 1 mg/kg IP from days 9-18); the CoQ10 + ISO group (CoQ10 100 mg/kg orally for 18 days and ISO 1 mg/kg IP from days 9-18); and the control group (olive oil 2 mL/kg orally for 18 days and water IP from days 9-18). Twenty-four hours after the last dose of water or ISO, the rats were anesthetized and an ECG was recorded. Blood was withdrawn by retro-orbital puncture for estimation of serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and aspartate aminotransferase activities. The animals were euthanized using an overdose of ether. The hearts of 6 animals from each group were used for estimation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, lipid peroxidation (LPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total protein concentration. Histopathology of the 2 remaining hearts in each group was carried out by a blinded technician.\nA total of 24 rats (8 in each group) were used in this study; all rats survived to study end. Compared with the control group, the ISO-treated rats had a significant change in heart to body weight ratio (P < 0.001); significant changes in the endogenous antioxidants (ie, significantly higher myocardial MDA concentration [P < 0.001]; significantly lower myocardial GSH concentration [P < 0.001] and SOD activity [P < 0.01]); and significantly higher serum activities of marker enzymes (eg, CK-MB [P < 0.001] and LDH [P < 0.001]).

{"title": "Extracellular matrix remodelling in myocardial hypertrophy and failure : focus on osteopontin.", "abstract": "Cardiac remodelling refers to molecular and cellular changes of the myocardium, as well as adapting alterations in size, shape and function of the heart in response to changing loading conditions. It represents the final common pathway of different heart diseases, and is recognized as a crucial aspect of cardiac and myocardial dysfunction and a well established determinant of the clinical course of heart failure.Osteopontin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein secreted by osteoblasts, osteoclasts, macrophages, T cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Osteopontin is not expressed in healthy cardiac tissue, although its expression can be triggered by pressure or volume overload, hypoxia and angiotensin II. Indeed, osteopontin has been reported in macrophages and interstitial tissues early after myocardial infarction and in cardiac macrophage-like cells of inflammatory lesions in experimental models of cardiomyopathy. Pressure overload is associated with osteopontin overexpression as well. Indeed, myocardial osteopontin messenger RNA is upregulated in rats following renovascular hypertension or aortic banding. In humans, a significant correlation exists between increased osteopontin immunoreactivity in cardiac myocytes and impaired left ventricular function or cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.The present article focuses on the role of osteopontin in myocardial hypertrophy and remodelling. In general, evidence supports the concept that osteopontin plays a crucial role in extracellular matrix remodelling following myocardial adaptation to hypertrophic, inflammatory and neurohormonal stimuli in the overloaded heart.", "journal": "High blood pressure & cardiovascular prevention : the official journal of the Italian Society of Hypertension", "date": "2009-12-01", "authors": ["PietroFrancia", "AriannaUccellini", "AlessandraFrattari", "AnnaModestino", "AgneseRicotta", "CristinaBalla", "LudovicaScialla", "MassimoVolpe"], "doi": "10.2165/11530450-000000000-00000"}

N. caninum and T. gondii are important abortive agents of cattle and sheep, respectively, and may infect numerous animal species. Hammondia sp. is not known to induce disease in animals, but may cause confusion in the identification of closely related coccidia. The aim of this study was to investigate infection rates caused by N. caninum, Hammondia sp., and T. gondii in beef cattle using a nested PCR for Toxoplasmatinae rDNA, followed by sequencing of the PCR products. Antibodies to N. caninum and T. gondii were also investigated in the tested animals. Brains and hearts were obtained from 100 beef cattle in a slaughterhouse in Bahia. Seven samples from brain tested positive for Toxoplasmatinae DNA. No positive reactions were found in heart tissues. After sequencing of the PCR products from all positive tissues, five sequences matched with N. caninum and two matched with T. gondii. Antibodies to N. caninum and T. gondii were found in 20% and 26% of the animals, respectively. The confirmation of N. caninum and the absence of Hammondia heydorni in the tested animals is suggestive that cattle are not efficient intermediate hosts of H. heydorni; however further studies need to be performed using a greater variety of tissues and a higher sample size.

{"title": "Resveratrol prevents the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction in the SHR without lowering blood pressure.", "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a compensatory enlargement of the heart in response to stress such as hypertension. It is beneficial in reducing stress placed on the heart. However, when the stress is of a chronic nature, it becomes pathological and leads to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Current treatments for hypertension and heart failure have proven beneficial but are not highly specific and associated with side effects. Accordingly, there is an important need for alternative strategies to provide safe and effective treatment.\nTen-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with resveratrol (2.5 mg/kg/day) for a period of 10 weeks. Systolic blood pressure, and cardiac structure and function were measured in all groups at different time points of resveratrol treatment. Oxidative stress was also determined in all groups after 10 weeks of resveratrol treatment.\nSHRs were characterized with high blood pressure and concentric hypertrophy from 15 weeks of age. Cardiac functional abnormalities were also evident in SHR from 15 weeks onwards. Resveratrol treatment significantly prevented the development of concentric hypertrophy, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction in SHR without lowering blood pressure. Resveratrol also significantly reduced the oxidative stress levels of cardiac tissue in SHR.\nResveratrol treatment was beneficial in preventing the development of concentric hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction in SHR. The cardioprotective effect of resveratrol in SHR may be partially mediated by a reduction in oxidative stress.

In response to oxidative stress, NQR-derived protein thiols at the 51- and 75-kDa subunits are known to be reversibly S-glutathionylated. Although several glutathionylated domains from NQR 51 and 75 kDa have been identified, their roles in the regulatory functions remain to be explored. To gain further insights into protein S-glutathionylation of complex I, we used two peptides of S-glutathionylated domain ((200)GAGAYICGEETALIESIEGK(219) of 51-kDa protein and (361)VDSDTLCTEEVFPTAGAGTDLR(382) of 75-kDa protein) as chimeric epitopes incorporating a \"promiscuous\" T-cell epitope to generate two polyclonal antibodies, AbGSCA206 and AbGSCB367. Binding of AbGSCA206 and AbGSCB367 inhibited NQR-mediated O2-* generation by 37 and 57%, as measured by EPR spin-trapping. To further provide an appropriate control, two peptides of non-glutathionylated domain ((21)SGDTTAPKKTSFGSLKDFDR(40) of 51-kDa peptide and (100)WNILTNSEKTKKAREGVMEFL(120) of 75-kDa peptide) were synthesized as chimeric epitopes to generate two polyclonal antibodies, Ab51 and Ab75. Binding of A51 did not affect NQR-mediated generation to a significant level. However, binding of Ab75 inhibited NQR-mediated O2-*generation by 35%. None of AbGSCA206, AbGSCB367, Ab51, or Ab75 showed an inhibitory effect on the electron transfer activity of NQR, suggesting that antibody binding to the glutathione-binding domain decreased electron leakage from the hydrophilic domain of NQR. When heart tissue homogenates were immunoprecipitated with Ab51 or Ab75 and probed with an antibody against glutathione, protein S-glutathionylation was enhanced in post-ischemic myocardium at the NQR 51-kDa subunit, but not at the 75-kDa subunit, indicating that the 51-kDa subunit of flavin subcomplex is more sensitive to oxidative stress resulting from myocardial infarction.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2009-11-27", "authors": ["JingfengChen", "Chwen-LihChen", "SharadRawale", "Chun-AnChen", "Jay LZweier", "Pravin T PKaumaya", "Yeong-RennChen"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M109.056846"}
{"title": "Acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume independently of coronary flow reserve.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelium is covered with an extensive mesh of glycocalyx constituents, which acts like an effective barrier up to several micrometers thick that shields the luminal surface of the vasculature from direct exposure to flowing blood. Many studies report that various enzymatic and pharmaceutical challenges are able to increase glycocalyx porosity, resulting in farther permeation of plasma macromolecules and greater access of red blood cells into glycocalyx domain. Attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties therefore potentially increases the amount of blood that effectively occupies available microvascular volume. We tested in the present study whether attenuation of coronary glycocalyx barrier properties actually increases coronary blood volume and whether such changes would be noticeable during measurements of coronary flow reserve using adenosine. In anesthetized goats (n = 6) with cannulated left main coronary artery that were perfused under controlled pressure, coronary blood volume was measured via the indicator-dilution technique using high-molecular-weight (2,000 kDa) dextrans as plasma tracer and labeled red blood cells as red blood cell tracer. Coronary blood volume was determined at baseline and during intracoronary infusion of adenosine causing maximal vasodilation (0.2-0.6 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) before and after intracoronary hyaluronidase treatment (170,000 units) of the glycocalyx. With an intact glycocalyx, coronary blood volume was 18.9 +/- 1.1 ml/100 g heart tissue at baseline, which increased to 26.3 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g after hyaluronidase treatment of the coronary glycocalyx. Maximal vasodilation by administration of adenosine further increased coronary blood volume to 33.9 +/- 6.8 ml/100 g, a value not different from the maximal coronary blood volume of 33.2 +/- 5.3 ml/100 g obtained by administration of adenosine in the absence of hyaluronidase treatment. Adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance were not affected by hyaluronidase treatment. We conclude that acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coronary blood volume by approximately 40%, which is of similar magnitude as additional changes in coronary blood volume during subsequent maximal vasodilation with adenosine. Furthermore, maximal coronary blood volume following administration of adenosine was similar with and without prior hyaluronidase degradation of the glycocalyx, suggesting that adenosine and hyaluronidase potentially increase glycocalyx porosity to a similar extent. Hyaluronidase-mediated changes in coronary blood volume did not affect baseline and adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance, demonstrating that measurements of coronary flow reserve are insufficient to detect impairment of coronary blood volume recruitment in conditions of damaged glycocalyx.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

CDR3 lengths were similar to the ones found in the healthy repertoire and significantly shorter than in other infections. VH derived from anti-T. cruzi Fab and plasma cells showed a higher proportion of hypermutated genes, 46.9% and 43.75%, respectively, vs 30.9% of the cChHD patient repertoire, pointing to the role of parasite Ags in the shaping of the humoral response in Chagas' disease.

In this paper, the mechanics of these rupture events is described, and the effect of insertion velocity on needle force, tissue deformation, and needle work is analyzed. Using the J integral method from fracture mechanics, rupture events are modeled as sudden crack extensions that occur when the release rate J of strain energy concentrated at the tip of the crack exceeds the fracture toughness of the material. It is shown that increasing the velocity of needle insertion will reduce the force of the rupture event when it increases the energy release rate. A nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin model is then used to predict the relationship between the deformation of tissue and the rupture force at different velocities. The model predicts that rupture deformation and work asymptotically approach minimum values as needle velocity increases. Consequently, most of the benefit of using a higher needle velocity can be achieved using a finite velocity that is inversely proportional to the relaxation time of the tissue.

Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: untreated controls (GI); normal rats receiving rutin (GII); untreated diabetics (GIII); diabetic rats receiving rutin (GIV). STZ was injected at a single dose of 60 mg kg(-1) to induce diabetes mellitus.

Gene and protein expression of periostin was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, and was similarly decreased compared with LVH mice. Immunohistochemical localization of periostin showed it was exclusively in the extracellular matrix of the myocardium. The decrease in periostin with pressure relief paralleled changes in interstitial fibrosis observed by picrosirius red staining. Corroborating the murine data, periostin expression was significantly reduced after LVAD-afforded pressure relief in patients.\nPeriostin is closely associated with pressure overload-induced LVH and LVH regression in both animal and human models.

Cells were exposed to strain in two directions, radially and circumferentially, which is similar to biaxial loading in real heart tissues. Thus, from a biomechanical point of view, the system is preferable to previous setups based on uniaxial stretching.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2009-11-20", "authors": ["PLinder", "JTrzewik", "MR\u00fcffer", "G MArtmann", "IDigel", "RKurz", "ARothermel", "ARobitzki", "ATemiz Artmann"], "doi": "10.1007/s11517-009-0552-y"}

In the present observational study, we tested the hypothesis that cardiac leptin production and signaling are increased in the failing human heart, and that mechanical unloading with a ventricular assist device (VAD) reverses these changes.\nAll studies were performed using human cardiac tissue obtained from (1) hearts not matched for transplantation (nonfailing), (2) at the time of cardiac transplant (failing), or (3) paired samples at the time of VAD implant (pre-VAD) and removal (post-VAD). The expression of brain naturetic peptide, leptin, leptin receptor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA was measured, and the protein expression of leptin and its receptor was examined by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining of cardiac sections. The assessment of leptin signaling was performed by measuring the phosphorylation state of the leptin receptor. The phosphorylation state of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and AMP-activated kinase proteins were also measured. All data are expressed as mean+/-SEM with a statistical significance in failing relative to nonfailing groups determined by Student independent t test, and the significance between pre- and post-VAD groups determined by paired t test. In failing human hearts, the mRNA expressions of leptin and its receptor were increased 5.4+/-0.3-fold (P<0.05) and 4.5+/-0.3-fold (P<0.05), respectively, with similar changes in protein. The phosphorylation state of both the leptin receptor and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 proteins were increased 1.4+/-0.1-fold (P<0.05), and the level of phosphorylated AMP-activated kinase protein was increased 1.9+/-0.2-fold (P<0.05). Mechanical unloading of the failing human heart with a VAD resulted in no change in tumor necrosis factor alpha expression but a marked decrease in leptin production to 1.7+/-0.1% (P<0.05) and leptin receptor expression to 3.0+/-0.2% (P<0.05) of pre-VAD levels. Phosphorylation of the leptin receptor, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, and AMP-activated kinase were also decreased to 45+/-7%, 75+/-8%, and 58+/-8% of pre-VAD values, respectively (P<0.05 for all values).\nThese results indicate that the failing human heart increases expression of leptin and its receptor and that mechanical unloading downregulates this increase. Further, a cardioprotective role for leptin in the failing human heart is suggested through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and AMP-activated kinase signaling.", "journal": "Circulation.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, has shown protective effects in ischemia-reperfusion injuries in some organ transplantations; however, its roles in cardiac transplantation have not been thoroughly evaluated. Lewis rats were divided into three groups (n = 8 in each group): sham, control, and NAC group. They were subjected to abdominal heterotopic cardiac transplantation and followed for 24 hours postoperation. For the NAC group, a bolus of NAC (150 mg/kg) was infused at 30 minutes before reperfusion, followed by 20 mg/kg/h for 1 hour; another 150 mg/kg NAC intraperitoneally administered 12 hours after reperfusion. Cardiac function and blood inflammation markers were measured at both 2 and 24 hours after reperfusion. Oxidative stress markers and neutrophil infiltration were evaluated in heart tissue at 24 hours postoperatively. Echocardiography showed that NAC significantly improved the postoperative fractional shortening of isografts (P < .01), although NAC had no effect on the heart rate. Serum lactate dehydrogenase also indicated a significant decrease in the NAC group at 24 hours posttransplantation (P = .02) Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 concentrations which rapidly increased postoperatively were reduced by administration of NAC. In transplanted hearts, the increased malondialdehyde level and myeloperoxidase activity were partially reversed by NAC (both P < .01); NAC also replenished endogenous glutathione. Finally, neutrophil infiltration in isografts was reduced in the NAC group.

This prooxidant reaction in cardiac myocytes and mitochondria accounts for necrotic cell death and subsequent myocardial scarring. It is intrinsically linked to increased intracellular zinc concentration ([Zn(2+)](i)) serving as an antioxidant. Herein, we addressed the temporal responses in coupled Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) dyshomeostasis, reflecting the prooxidant-antioxidant equilibrium, by examining preclinical (week 1) and pathological (week 4) stages of ALDOST to determine whether endogenous antioxidant defenses would be ultimately overwhelmed to account for this delay in cardiac remodeling. We compared responses in cardiomyocyte free [Ca(2+)](i) and [Zn(2+)](i) and mitochondrial total [Ca(2+)](m) and [Zn(2+)](m), together with biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses, during 1- and 4-wk ALDOST. At week 1 and compared with controls, we found: 1) elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](m) were coupled with [Zn(2+)](i) and [Zn(2+)](m); 2) increased mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production, cardiomyocyte xanthine oxidase activity, and cardiac and mitochondrial 8-isoprostane levels, counterbalanced by increased activity of antioxidant proteins, enzymes, and the nonenzymatic antioxidants that can be considered as cumulative antioxidant capacity; some of these enzymes and proteins (e.g., metallothionein-1, Cu/Zn-superoxide, glutathione synthase) are regulated by metal-responsive transcription factor-1; and 3) although these augmented antioxidant defenses were sustained at week 4, they fell short in combating the persistent intracellular Ca(2+) overloading and marked rise in cardiac tissue 8-isoprostane and mitochondrial transition pore opening. Thus a coupled Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) dyshomeostasis occurs early during ALDOST in cardiac myocytes and mitochondria that regulate redox equilibrium until week 4 when ongoing intracellular Ca(2+) overloading and prooxidants overwhelm antioxidant defenses.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

The results showed that endurance swimming prevented lipid peroxidation in the soleus muscle of HFML diet rats due to elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes.

Free radicals (FR), suproxide anion (*O(-)(2)) and nitric oxide anion (*NO(-)), are highly toxic and have detrimental effects on nitroso-redox balance in the myocyte. Myocardium is rich with beta-adrenergic receptors and endothelial is the site of NO production. The authors hypothesized that graded doses of dobutamine result in hyperkinetic state, which shifts the nitroso-redox balance toward the buildup of reactive species in dose-dependent excess. The purpose of the present study was to investigate free radicals production and coronary endothelial cell pathological changes following increasing length of breathing oxygen (100% O(2)) and progressive doses of dobutamine. Thirty-five adult male rats, matched with age and body weight, were randomly assigned to 7 groups. The first group served as control (C) and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th groups were exposed to hyperoxia (100% O(2) breathing) for 24,48, and 72 h, whereas the 5th, 6th, and 7th groups were injected dobutamine 10,20, and 30 microg kg(-1), respectively. Following the treatment condition for each group, animals were sacrificed and heart tissues were divided randomly into two parts. The first part was processed for the ultrastructure, using transmission electron microscope (TEM), and the second was homogenized for FR determination. TEM examination showed that O2 breathing for 24 h resulted in hypertrophy and proliferation of endothelial cells lining the coronary capillary, which was lodged by lymphoid cells. Distended and irregular contour of endothelium, enlarged nucleus, protrusion membrane, as well as pinocytotic vesicles were also observed. Free radicals (FR) production at all levels of hyperoxia exposures and dobutamine injections were significantly (p < .05) higher than control group. In addition, dobutamine induced higher relative FR production, as compared with hyperoxia, implying more severe myocyte injury. Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that O2 breathing for 24 h or higher resulted in variety of pathological changes of the endothelium of coronary capillary that were induced by the buildup of oxidants by-products. Because dobutamine caused relative higher in FR production levels, as compared with hyperoxia levels, throughout this implied it aggravated the myocyte capillaries' endothelium more heavily, which could have resulted in more intense ultrastructural deteriorations.", "journal": "Ultrastructural pathology", "date": "2009-11-10", "authors": ["Essam HMattar", "Al-Said AHaffor"], "doi": "10.3109/01913120903275626"}

The argument illustrates the enactment of regulation at different stages and highlights the accompanying interpretative strategies employed by the medical personnel involved in the management of clinical trials using patients' own (autologous) stem cells to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue. We argue that the implementation of regulation is a practical accomplishment in both national contexts. The complexities present in this process are instanced by the gradual crystallisation of practices within the organisation of clinical trials.

Estivation is similar to the diapause and hibernation of other animal species in that it is characterized by negligible activity and a profoundly depressed metabolic rate. As is typically observed in quiescent states, estivating P. dolloi are resistant to environmental stresses. We tested the hypothesis that P. dolloi enhances stress resistance during estivation by upregulating intracellular antioxidant defences in brain and heart tissues. We found that most of the major intracellular antioxidant enzymes, including the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, cytosolic superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, were upregulated in brain tissue of lungfish that had estivated for 60 days. Several of these enzymes were also elevated in heart tissue of estivators. These changes were not due to food deprivation, as they did not occur in a group of fish that were deprived of food but maintained in water for the same period of time. We found little evidence of tissue oxidative damage in estivators. Products of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal adducts) and oxidative protein damage (carbonylation) were similar in estivating and control lungfish. However, protein nitrotyrosine levels were elevated in brain tissue of estivators.

{"title": "Innovation in basic science: stem cells and their role in the treatment of paediatric cardiac failure--opportunities and challenges.", "abstract": "Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide. Current therapies only delay progression of the cardiac disease or replace the diseased heart with cardiac transplantation. Stem cells represent a recently discovered novel approach to the treatment of cardiac failure that may facilitate the replacement of diseased cardiac tissue and subsequently lead to improved cardiac function and cardiac regeneration. A stem cell is defined as a cell with the properties of being clonogenic, self-renewing, and multipotent. In response to intercellular signalling or environmental stimuli, stem cells differentiate into cells derived from any of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, a powerful advantage for regenerative therapies. Meanwhile, a cardiac progenitor cell is a multipotent cell that can differentiate into cells of any of the cardiac lineages, including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Stem cells can be classified into three categories: (1) adult stem cells, (2) embryonic stem cells, and (3) induced pluripotential cells. Adult stem cells have been identified in numerous organs and tissues in adults, including bone-marrow, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and, as was recently discovered, the heart. Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage of the developing embryo. Finally through transcriptional reprogramming, somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, can be converted into induced pluripotential cells that resemble embryonic stem cells. Four classes of stem cells that may lead to cardiac regeneration are: (1) Embryonic stem cells, (2) Bone Marrow derived stem cells, (3) Skeletal myoblasts, and (4) Cardiac stem cells and cardiac progenitor cells. Embryonic stem cells are problematic because of several reasons: (1) the formation of teratomas, (2) potential immunologic cellular rejection, (3) low efficiency of their differentiation into cardiomyocytes, typically 1% in culture, and (4) ethical and political issues. As of now, bone marrow derived stem cells have not been proven to differentiate reproducibly and reliably into cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Sulindac confers high level ischemic protection to the heart through late preconditioning mechanisms.", "abstract": "We have recently shown that sulindac, an anti-inflammatory drug, enhances the killing of cancer cells, but not normal cells, under conditions of oxidative stress, by mechanisms unrelated to its cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. To further study the protective effect of sulindac on cells exposed to oxidative stress, we have investigated the effect of sulindac on rat cardiac myocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation, as well as in a Langendorff model of myocardial ischemia. Low levels of sulindac could protect cardiac myocytes against cell death due to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In the Langendorff model sulindac provided significant protection against cell death, when the drug was fed to the animals before the removal of the heart for the Langendorff procedure. The results indicate that the primary protective effect of sulindac in these experiments does not involve its role as a COX inhibitor. Numerous signaling pathways have been implicated in myocardial protective mechanisms, many of which involve fluctuations in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results suggest that low levels of sulindac can induce a preconditioning response, triggered by ROS, to protect cardiac tissues against oxidative damage.

Secondly, after feeding of sulindac, two end-effectors of preconditioning, inducible nitric oxide synthase and heat shock protein 27, were found to be markedly induced in the heart, dependent on PKC.

{"title": "Growth hormones therapy in immune response against Trypanosoma cruzi.", "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is an important hypophyseal hormone that is primarily involved in body growth and metabolism. In mammals, control of Trypanosoma cruzi parasitism during the acute phase of infection is considered to be critically dependent on direct macrophage activation by cytokines. To explore the possibility that GH might be effective in the treatment of Chagas' disease, we investigated its effects on the course of T. cruzi infection in rats, focusing our analyses on its influences on parasitemia, NO, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma concentration and on histopathological alterations and parasite burden in heart tissue. T. cruzi-infected male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally treated with 5 ng/10 g body weight/day of GH. Animals treated with GH showed a significant reduction in the number of blood trypomastigotes during the acute phase of infection compared with untreated animals (P<0.05). For all experimental days (7, 14 and 21 post infection) of the acute phase, infected and GH treated animals reached higher concentrations of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and nitric oxide as compared to untreated and infected counterparts (P<0.05) Histopathological observations of heart tissue revealed that GH administration also resulted in fewer and smaller amastigote burdens, and less inflammatory infiltrate and tissue disorganization, indicating a reduced parasitism of this tissue. These results show that GH can be considered as an immunomodulator substance for controlling parasite replication and combined with the current drug used may represent in the future a new therapeutic tool to reduce the harmful effects of Chagas' disease.", "journal": "Research in veterinary science", "date": "2009-11-04", "authors": ["Eduardo Os\u00f3rioFrare", "Fabricia HelenaSantello", "Leony CristinaCaetano", "Jerri CCaldeira", "M\u00edriam Paula AlonsoToldo", "Jos\u00e9 Cl\u00f3vis doPrado"], "doi": "10.1016/j.rvsc.2009.10.001"}

Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and the control rats were injected with saline. After the induction of diabetes for 4 weeks, the animals were divided into different groups: (1) normal rats as control; (2) diabetic rats; (3) diabetic rats with administration of breviscapine (10 or 25 mg kg(-1) day(-2)). After treatment with breviscapine for 6 weeks, the invasive cardiac function and echocardiographic parameters were measured, and heart tissue was obtained for electron microscope study. The expression of protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium handling regulators, such as protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1), phospholamban (PLB) and Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA-2), ryanodine receptor (RyR) were detected by western blot or RT-PCR. The activity of SERCA-2 was measured using Ca(2+)-ATPase kit. Diabetic rats showed impaired cardiac structure and function compared with control rats. The expression of PKC, PLB increased significantly, while the PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR expression decreased. Treatment with breviscapine could reverse the cardiac dysfunction and structure changes in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats, and decrease the expression of PKC and PLB, as well as increase the expression of PPI-1, SERCA-2 and RyR. The protective effect of breviscapine was dose related.

The purposes of this study were 1) to examine the subcellular signaling pathways activated by HS and ischemic preconditioning (IP) in intact hearts, 2) to determine whether HS and IP activate an integrated survival pathway similar to that activated by HS in cultured NRVMs, and 3) to determine whether HS and IP reduce lethal cell injury in perfused intact hearts. Adult rat hearts perfused in the Langendorff mode were subjected to 25 min of global ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion (I/R) either 24 h after whole animal HS or following a standard IP protocol. Myocardial signaling was analyzed using Western blot analysis, whereas cell death was assayed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release into the perfusate and confirmed by light microscopy. Similar to NRVMs, HS performed in the whole animal 24 h before I/R increased phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine-397 and protein kinase B (Akt) and resulted in protection from cell death. Using IP as a myocardial stress also resulted in an increased phosphorylation/activation of both FAK and Akt and resulted in reduced cell death in adult perfused rat hearts subjected to I/R. In conclusion, 1) myocardial stress caused by whole animal HS activates cytoskeletal-based survival signaling pathways in whole heart tissue and reduces lethal I/R injury and 2) IP activates the same stress-induced survival pathway and the activation correlates with the well-known cardioprotective effect of IP on lethal I/R injury.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Thyroid hormone and angiogenesis.", "abstract": "In models of thyroid hormone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, there is appropriate, supportive angiogenesis. Twenty years ago in one such model, angiogenesis in response to the hormone was observed before hypertrophy developed and it is now understood that iodothyronines induce neovascularization in a variety of settings, including the heart, ischemic striated muscle and tumor beds. The molecular mechanism of the proangiogenic action of thyroid hormone is both nongenomic and genomic. It is initiated nongenomically at the cell surface receptor for the hormone on integrin alphavbeta3. Kinase transduction of the hormone signal and, ultimately, transcription of several anagiogenesis-relevant genes result. The genes include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In addition, the integrin receptor for thyroid hormone (l-thyroxine, T(4), and 3, 5, 3'-triiodo-l-thyronine, T(3)) engages in crosstalk with the VEGF and bFGF receptors. Occlusion with tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) of the hormone receptor on the integrin in the absence of T(4) and T(3) suppresses the angiogenic effects of VEGF and bFGF. Tetrac also blocks the proangiogenic actions of T(4) and T(3). Other thyroid hormone analogues that are angiogenic include diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor-beta-selective agonist, GC-1. Thyroid hormone sustains angiogenesis and coronary blood flow about infarcted heart tissue in experimental models and blocks deleterious heart remodeling that otherwise is predictable in such tissue. The hormone may also induce expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) gene, a transcription factor important to coronary artery collateralization in the setting of hypoxia. The hormone also causes transcription of the matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene that opposes vascular smooth muscle calcification.", "journal": "Vascular pharmacology", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["Mary KLuidens", "Shaker AMousa", "Faith BDavis", "Hung-YunLin", "Paul JDavis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.vph.2009.10.007"}
{"title": "Effects of fibroblast-myocyte coupling on cardiac conduction and vulnerability to reentry: A computational study.", "abstract": "Recent experimental studies have documented that functional gap junctions form between fibroblasts and myocytes, raising the possibility that fibroblasts play roles in cardiac electrophysiology that extend beyond acting as passive electrical insulators.\nThe purpose of this study was to use computational models to investigate how fibroblasts may affect cardiac conduction and vulnerability to reentry under different fibroblast-myocyte coupling conditions and tissue structures.\nComputational models of two-dimensional tissue with fibroblast-myocyte coupling were developed and numerically simulated. Myocytes were modeled by the phase I of the Luo-Rudy model, and fibroblasts were modeled by a passive model.\nBesides slowing conduction by cardiomyocyte decoupling and electrotonic loading, fibroblast coupling to myocytes elevates myocyte resting membrane potential, causing conduction velocity to first increase and then decrease as fibroblast content increases, until conduction failure occurs. Fibroblast-myocyte coupling can also enhance conduction by connecting uncoupled myocytes. These competing effects of fibroblasts on conduction give rise to different conduction patterns under different fibroblast-myocyte coupling conditions and tissue structures. Elevation of myocyte resting potential due to fibroblast-myocyte coupling slows sodium channel recovery, which extends postrepolarization refractoriness. Owing to this prolongation of the myocyte refractory period, reentry was more readily induced by a premature stimulation in heterogeneous tissue models when fibroblasts were electrotonically coupled to myocytes compared with uncoupled fibroblasts acting as pure passive electrical insulators.\nFibroblasts affect cardiac conduction by acting as obstacles or by creating electrotonic loading and elevating myocyte resting potential. Functional fibroblast-myocyte coupling prolongs the myocyte refractory period, which may facilitate induction of reentry in cardiac tissue with fibrosis.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["YuanfangXie", "AlanGarfinkel", "PatriziaCamelliti", "PeterKohl", "James NWeiss", "ZhilinQu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.08.003"}
{"title": "Perforin-expressing cytotoxic cells contribute to chronic cardiomyopathy in Trypanosoma cruzi infection.", "abstract": "Understanding the dual participation of the immune response in controlling the invader and at the same time causing tissue damage might contribute to the design of effective new vaccines and therapies for Chagas disease. Perforin, a cytolytic protein product of killer cells, is involved in resistance to acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection. However, the contribution of perforin in parasite control and chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is unclear. Perforin-positive cells were detected in the heart tissue during the acute and chronic phases of infection of C57BL/6 mice inoculated with low dose (10(2) parasites) of the Colombian T. cruzi strain. This protocol led to acute phase survival in both wild-type and perforin null (pfp(-/-)) mice lineages. During the chronic infection, parasitism and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as well as interleukin (IL)-4+ and, mainly, interferon (IFN)-gamma+ cells were more elevated in the heart tissue of pfp(-/-) mice. Higher levels of circulating NO and anti-parasite immunoglobulin (Ig)G2c and IgG3, paralleled by a prominent frequency of IFN-gamma+ and IL-10+ splenocytes, were present in pfp(-/-)-infected mice. Therefore, although the perforin-dependent pathway plays a role, it is not crucial for anti-T. cruzi immunity and acute phase survival of mice infected with a low inoculum. Further, perforin deficiency resulted in lower activity of creatine kinase-muscle brain isoform (CK-MB) isoenzyme in serum and a more restricted connexin 43 loss, both of which are markers of the cardiomyocyte lesion. Moreover, perforin deficiency hampered the development of severe electrocardiographic abnormalities. Hence, our results corroborate that perforin-bearing cytotoxic cells might contribute to cardiomyocyte lesion and heart dysfunction during chronic T. cruzi infection, shedding light on immunopathogenesis of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.", "journal": "International journal of experimental pathology", "date": "2009-11-03", "authors": ["Jaline CoutinhoSilverio", "Luzia Mariade-Oliveira-Pinto", "Andr\u00e9a Aliceda Silva", "Gabriel Melode Oliveira", "JoseliLannes-Vieira"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2613.2009.00670.x"}

The same question applies to human bocavirus (HBoV). We have determined the prevalence and quantity of B19V and HBoV DNA in heart tissue of patients who were not experiencing virus-related heart diseases and analyzed whether the seroprevalence corresponded to DNA prevalence in the heart.\nSamples of left-atrium heart tissue and serum were obtained from 100 patients who underwent open-heart surgery. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM against proteins encoded by B19V and HBoV were detected by enzyme-linked immunoabsorption assay and immunoblotting. B19V and HBoV DNA concentrations were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in heart tissue and serum samples. Nested PCRs for VP1, K71, and GT3 identified the B19V genotypes.\nThe prevalences of serum IgG specific for B19V and HBoV were 85% and 96%, respectively. Of all the patients, 85% had B19V DNA detected in heart tissues, and 4% displayed low-level B19V viremia, whereas only 5% of heart tissue samples and none of the serum samples demonstrated HBoV DNA. The sensitivity of B19V serological testing for B19V DNA in heart samples was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.0). Specificity was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.0), and the positive predictive value was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.0). B19V genotypes 1 and 2 were present in 11% and 89% of heart tissues samples, respectively. B19V genotype 3 was not detected in any of the samples.\nOur data suggest that B19V but not HBoV demonstrates a lifelong persistence in the heart.

No shortening of telomere length was observed in the heart tissue of OLETF rats, whereas telomerase activity was decreased in OLETF heart tissue.

However, clinical data are conflicting, and demonstrate modest improvements. BM MNCs consist of different subpopulations including stem cells, progenitors, and differentiated leukocytes.\nStem cells (c-kit+) and subsets of mature cells including myeloid lineage, B and T-cells were isolated from bone marrow harvested from isogeneic donor rats.

{"title": "Interrogating functional integration between injected pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and surrogate cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Myocardial infarction resulting in irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) remains a leading cause of heart failure. Although cell transplantation has modestly improved cardiac function, major challenges including increasing cell survival, engraftment, and functional integration with host tissue, remain. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which can be differentiated into cardiac progenitors (CPs) and CMs, represent a candidate cell source for cardiac cell therapy. However, it is not known what specific cell type or condition is the most appropriate for transplantation. This problem is exasperated by the lack of efficient and predictive strategies to screen the large numbers of parameters that may impact cell transplantation. We used a cardiac tissue model, engineered heart tissue (EHT), and quantitative molecular and electrophysiological analyses, to test transplantation conditions and specific cell populations for their potential to functionally integrate with the host tissue. In this study, we validated our analytical platform using contractile mouse neonatal CMs (nCMs) and noncontractile cardiac fibroblasts (cFBs), and screened for the integration potential of ESC-derived CMs and CPs (ESC-CMs and -CPs). Consistent with previous in vivo studies, cFB injection interfered with electrical signal propagation, whereas injected nCMs improved tissue function. Purified bioreactor-generated ESC-CMs exhibited a diminished capacity for electrophysiological integration; a result correlated with lower (compared with nCMs) connexin 43 expression. ESC-CPs, however, appeared able to appropriately mature and integrate into EHT, enhancing the amplitude of tissue contraction.

To further investigate the function of Xin variants in the mammalian heart, we generated XinABC(-/-) mice deficient in all Xin isoforms.\nXinABC(-/-) mice showed a very mild phenotype: heart weight, heart weight to tibia length ratios, and cardiac dimensions were not altered. Increased perivascular fibrosis was only observed in hearts of young XinABC(-/-) mice. Striking differences were revealed in isolated cardiomyocytes: XinABC(-/-) cells demonstrated a significantly increased number of non-terminally localized ID-like structures. Furthermore, resting sarcomere length was increased, sarcomere shortening, peak shortening at 0.5-1 Hz, and the duration of shortening were decreased, and shortening and relengthening velocities were accelerated at frequencies above 4 Hz in XinABC(-/-) cardiomyocytes. ECG showed a significantly shorter HV interval and a trend towards shorter QRS interval in XinABC(-/-) mice, suggesting a faster conduction velocity of the ventricular-specific conduction system. In human cardiac tissue, expression of XinC protein was detected solely in samples from patients with cardiac hypertrophy.\nTotal Xin deficiency leads to topographical ID alterations, premature fibrosis and subtle changes in contractile behaviour; this is a milder cardiac phenotype than that observed in XinAB(-/-) mice, which still can express XinC. Together with the finding that XinC is detected solely in cardiomyopathic human tissues, this suggests that its expression is responsible for the stronger dominant phenotype in XinAB(-/-) mice.

{"title": "Postconditioning with levosimendan reduces the infarct size involving the PI3K pathway and KATP-channel activation but is independent of PDE-III inhibition.", "abstract": "Reperfusion injury is strongly involved in the loss of functional heart tissue in patients after acute myocardial infarction. Various signal transduction pathways to reduce infarct size during reperfusion have been characterized. However, so far in the clinical setting no standard therapies are applied due to the lack of suitable drugs. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer, has been shown to improve survival in cardiogenic shock after infarction. Focus of the present study was to address the question, whether a bolus application of levosimendan prior to reperfusion is able to reduce the infarct size. A well-characterized model, the in vivo rat model, was used and levosimendan applied 5 min prior to reperfusion after 30-min occlusion of the left coronary artery followed by a 30-min reperfusion period. This pharmacological postconditioning was compared to the ischemic postconditioning with three times occlusion/reperfusion periods of 30 s each. To further address the question if in this in vivo model the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway may be involved, the PDE-III inhibiting property of levosimendan was compared to the PDE-III inhibitor enoximone. Ischemic postconditioning significantly reduced the infarct size from 48 +/- 2 to 32 +/- 1% of the area at risk (P < 0.05). Similarly, levosimendan decreased infarct size down to 29 +/- 3%. The combination of ischemic postconditioning and pharmacological postconditioning using levosimendan did not result in a further reduction of the infarct size. Both, the mitochondrial KATP-channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin abolished the protection afforded by levosimendan completely, while the inhibitors alone did not influence the infarct size in control hearts. Pharmacological postconditioning with enoximone did not result in any infarct size reduction. Postconditioning with levosimendan significantly increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) at 5 min of reperfusion, an effect which could be blocked completely by the additional administration of wortmannin. In conclusion, levosimendan applied prior to reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction significantly reduces the infarct size in an in vivo rat model. This protection involves the PI3K pathway and the activation of mitochondrial KATP-channels, but is independent of PDE-III inhibition. This finding may open new possibilities for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction using levosimendan, which is an already established therapy in cardiogenic shock.

We simulated exposure at rest to 6462 ppm CO (10 min) and to 265 ppm CO (480 min), and during three levels of exercise at 20% HbCO. We compared responses of carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), MbCO and P(c)O2 to estimate the potential for myocardial injury due to CO hypoxia. Simulation results predict that during CO exposures and subsequent therapies, cardiac tissue has higher MbCO levels and lower P(c)O2's than skeletal muscle. CO exposure during exercise further decreases P(c)O2 from resting levels. We conclude that in rest and moderate exercise, the myocardium is at greater risk for hypoxic injury than skeletal muscle during the course of CO exposure and washout.

During hypoxia, Cripto-1 expression levels were significantly elevated in mES cells and in Ntera-2 or NCCIT human embryonal carcinoma cells, as compared with cells growing with normal oxygen levels. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha directly regulated Cripto-1 expression by binding to hypoxia-responsive elements within the promoter of mouse and human Cripto-1 genes in mES and NCCIT cells, respectively. Furthermore, hypoxia modulated differentiation of mES cells by enhancing formation of beating cardiomyocytes as compared with mES cells that were differentiated under normoxia. However, hypoxia failed to induce differentiation of mES cells into cardiomyocytes in the absence of Cripto-1 expression, demonstrating that Cripto-1 is required for hypoxia to fully differentiate mES cells into cardiomyocytes.

{"title": "Spatial regulation of intracellular pH in multicellular strands of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.", "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pHi), an important modulator of cardiac function, is normally regulated to within narrow limits (7.1-7.2). In adult ventricular cell pairs, localized cellular pHi disturbances are removed by sarcolemmal acid/base transporters, but can also be dissipated (diluted) across gap junctions, aboard mobile buffers such as CO2/HCO3- and histidine-containing dipeptides (HCDPs). In the present work, we test this model of spatial pHi regulation in multicellular strands of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.\nWe confocally image pHi (intracellular fluorescence emitted from the pH dye carboxy-SNARF-1) in multicellular (>500 microm long, approximately 30 microm wide) cultured strands of electrically coupled, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Activity of sarcolemmal Na+/H+ exchange and Na+-HCO3- co-transport resembles that in adult cells. Localized photolytic H+ uncaging from intracellular 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, in the presence of CO2/HCO3- buffer, triggers considerable passive H+ spread along a strand, thus helping to dissipate the acid load. Inhibition of gap junctions (with alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid) truncates the spread, indicating they are conduits for local intracellular H+ flux. Without CO2/HCO3- buffer, longitudinal H+ mobility is reduced by approximately 90%, indicating that intracellular and cell-to-cell H+ flux relies far less on intrinsic mobile buffers (e.g. HCDPs) in neonates than in adults. This is consistent with five-fold lower HCDP levels in neonatal, compared to adult, ventricular tissue, and also with measurements of a lower intrinsic (non-CO2/HCO3-) H+ buffering capacity in neonatal strands compared with freshly isolated adult cells.\nWe conclude that mobile buffers and gap junctions are key spatial controllers of pHi in cardiac tissue, helping to maintain a myocardial pHi syncitium. In neonatal tissue, intracellular H+ movement is CO2/HCO3- dependent, while adult tissue relies increasingly on intrinsic dipeptides that provide additional spatial pHi control, appropriate for the developmental increase in myocyte size.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2009-10-16", "authors": ["PawelSwietach", "PatriziaCamelliti", "AlzbetaHulikova", "PeterKohl", "Richard DVaughan-Jones"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvp343"}

This paper demonstrates altered tissue distribution of the OCTN2 substrate pyrilamine in juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs) mice, which have a hereditary defect of the octn2 gene. At 30 min after intravenous injection of pyrilamine, the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio (K(p)) in the heart and pancreas was higher, whereas the K(p) in kidney and testis was lower in jvs mice compared with wild-type mice. Pyrilamine transport studies in isolated heart slices confirmed higher accumulation, together with lower efflux, of pyrilamine in the heart of jvs mice. The higher accumulation in heart slices of jvs mice was abolished by lowering the temperature, by increasing the substrate concentration, and in the presence of other H(1) antagonists or another OCTN2 substrate, carnitine, suggesting that OCTN2 extrudes pyrilamine from heart tissue. On the other hand, the lower distribution to the kidney of jvs mice was probably due to down-regulation of a basolateral transporter coupled with OCTN2, because, in jvs mice, (i) the K(p) of pyrilamine in kidney assessed immediately after intravenous injection (approximately 1 min) was also lower, (ii) the urinary excretion of pyrilamine was lower, and (iii) the uptake of pyrilamine in kidney slices was lower. The renal uptake of pyrilamine was saturable (K(m) approximately 236 microM) and was strongly inhibited by cyproheptadine, astemizole, ebastine and terfenadine.

{"title": "Chemopreventive doses of resveratrol do not produce cardiotoxicity in a rodent model of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most lethal cancers, results in more than one million fatalities worldwide every year. In view of the limited therapeutic alternatives and poor prognosis of liver cancer, preventive control approaches, notably chemoprevention, have been considered to be the best strategy in lowering the present prevalence of the disease. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring antioxidant and antiinflammatory agent found in grapes and red wine, inhibits carcinogenesis with a pleiotropic mode of action. Recently, we have reported that dietary resveratrol significantly prevents chemically-induced liver tumorigenesis in rats. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol-mediated chemoprevention of hepatocarcinogenesis could be related to its antiinflammatory action through hepatic cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibition. Although several COX-2 inhibitors are known to exert chemopreventive efficacy, not all are considered ideal candidates for chemoprevention due to the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of resveratrol on cardiac performance during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis initiated with diethylnitrosamine and promoted by phenobarbital. Rats had free access to diet supplemented with resveratrol four weeks before the carcinogen injection and 14 weeks thereafter. The cardiotoxicity of resveratrol was assessed by monitoring the cardiac function using transthoracic echocardiography as well as Western blot analysis of cardiac tissue. Long-term dietary administration of resveratrol dose-dependently suppressed hepatic tumor multiplicity, the principal endpoint for evaluating the chemopreventive potential of a candidate agent. The chemopreventive effects of resveratrol were also reflected in histopathological assessment of hepatic tissues.

{"title": "Cardiac biomarkers in a model of acute catecholamine cardiotoxicity.", "abstract": "Coronary heart disease and in particular its most serious form - acute myocardial infarction (AMI) - represents the most common cause of mortality in developed countries. Better prognosis may be achieved by understanding the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of AMI. Therefore, a catecholamine model of myocardial injury, which has appeared to be very similar to AMI in human in some aspect, was used. Male Wistar:Han rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (saline) and isoprenaline group (ISO; synthetic catecholamine, 100 mg.kg(- 1) subcutaneously [s.c.]). After 24 hours, functional parameters were measured, biochemical markers in the blood and metals content in the heart tissue were analysed and histological examination was performed. ISO caused marked myocardial injury that was associated with myocardial calcium overload. Close correlation between myocardial impairment (i.e. serum TnT, stroke volume index and wet ventricles weight) and the levels of myocardial calcium was observed. Direct reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was documented only by non-significant increase in malonyldialdehyde 24 hours after ISO injury. Moreover, myocardial element analysis revealed no significant changes as for the content of zinc and iron while selenium and copper increased in the ISO group although it reached statistical significance only for the latter.", "journal": "Human & experimental toxicology", "date": "2009-10-09", "authors": ["PremyslMladenka", "Radom\u00edrHrdina", "ZuzanaBobrovov\u00e1", "Vladim\u00edrSemecky", "JaroslavaV\u00e1vrov\u00e1", "Magdal\u00e9naHoleckov\u00e1", "VladimirPalicka", "YvonaMazurov\u00e1", "PetrNachtigal"], "doi": "10.1177/0960327109350665"}

Also, the atria, ventricle and main artery have different specific excitation spectra at the wavelength of 340 nm. The main fluorescence peaks were of NADH (at about 460 nm), collagen and elastin (at about 290-400 nm). The Gauss spectra of atria and ventricle were different in the peak value, relative intensity and half width. So the ratios of fluorescence intensities of peaks may be used to distinguish different heart tissues.

Therefore, culturing heart cells in 3-dimensions at high density and construction of engineered cardiac tissue in vitro is very difficult. The aim of this study was to simulate 3-dimensional culturing of cardiac cells and pursue a novel method to construct engineered cardiac tissue in vitro. The isolated neonatal rat ventricle cells were cultured at a high seeding density of 1 x 10(6)/cm2. The cells at high density metabolized actively; the glucose consumption and lactic acid production of ventricle cells were much greater than those of fibroblasts cultured at the same density. The pH value of the culture medium of ventricle cells consistently decreased more rapidly. These cultured ventricle cells contained vascular endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and smooth muscle cells that appeared close to each other, and had overlapping nuclei and plenty of extracellular collagen. The cells at high density were treated with 0.2% trypsin to construct engineered cardiac cell sheets without scaffold. The engineered cardiac cell sheets could beat and roll up spontaneously, each sheet was 3 to 5 cells thick, and contained abundant cardiomyocytes and extracellular collagen. In conclusion, cells cultured at high-density in vitro grew well in a 2-dimensional culturing environment, formed \"quasi 3-dimension\" culturing, and engineered cardiac cell sheets comprised of several layers of cells were constructed.

{"title": "Three distinct directions of intramural activation reveal nonuniform side-to-side electrical coupling of ventricular myocytes.", "abstract": "The anisotropy of cardiac tissue is a key determinant of 3D electric propagation and the stability of activation wave fronts in the heart. The electric properties of ventricular myocardium are widely assumed to be axially anisotropic, with activation propagating most rapidly in the myofiber direction and at uniform velocity transverse to this. We present new experimental evidence that contradicts this view.\nFor the first time, high-density intramural electric mapping (325 electrodes at approximately 4x4x1-mm spacing) from pig left ventricular tissue was used to reconstruct 3D paced activation surfaces projected directly onto 3D tissue structure imaged throughout the same left ventricular volume. These data from 5 hearts demonstrate that ventricular tissue is electrically orthotropic with 3 distinct propagation directions that coincide with local microstructural axes defined by the laminar arrangement of ventricular myocytes. The maximum conduction velocity of 0.67+/-0.019 ms(-1) was aligned with the myofiber axis. However, transverse to this, the maximum conduction velocity was 0.30+/-0.010 ms(-1), parallel to the myocyte layers and 0.17+/-0.004 ms(-1) normal to them. These orthotropic conduction velocities give rise to preferential activation pathways across the left ventricular free wall that are not captured by structurally detailed computer models, which incorporate axially anisotropic electric properties.\nOur findings suggest that current views on uniform side-to-side electric coupling in the heart need to be revised. In particular, nonuniform laminar myocardial architecture and associated electric orthotropy should be included in future models of initiation and maintenance of ventricular arrhythmia.", "journal": "Circulation.

Despite significant advances in structure-function relationships pertaining to the cardiac sarcomere, there is limited knowledge of how a mutation leads to clinical HCM. We, therefore, set out to study expression and localization of myofilament proteins in left ventricular tissue of patients with HCM.\nFrozen surgical myectomy specimens from 47 patients with HCM were examined and genotyped for mutations involving 8 myofilament-encoding genes. Myofilament protein levels were quantified by Western blotting with localization graded from immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections. Overall, 25 of 47 (53%) patients had myofilament-HCM, including 12 with MYBPC3-HCM and 9 with MYH7-HCM. As compared with healthy heart tissue, levels of myofilament proteins were increased in patients manifesting a mutation in either gene. Patients with a frameshift mutation predicted to truncate MYBPC3 exhibited marked disturbances in protein localization as compared with missense mutations in either MYBPC3 or MYH7.\nIn this first expression study in human HCM tissue, increased myofilament protein levels in patients with either MYBPC3- or MYH7-mediated HCM suggest a poison peptide mechanism.

As a proof-of-principle, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers were cultured to replicate the tissue microstructure of murine ventricular cross-sections. Specifically, DTMRI-measured in-plane cardiac fiber directions were converted into soft-lithography photomasks. Silicone stamps fabricated from the photomasks deposit fibronectin patterns to guide local cellular alignment. Fibronectin patterns consisted of a matrix of 190 microm(2) subregions, each comprised of parallel lines 11-20 microm-wide, spaced 2-8.5 microm apart, and angled to match local DTMRI-measured fiber directions. Within 6 days of culture, NRVMs established confluent, electrically coupled monolayers, and for 18 microm-wide, 5 microm-spaced lines, directions of cell alignment in subregions microscopically replicated DTMRI-measurements with a local error of 7.2 +/- 4.1 degrees . By adjusting fibronectin line widths and spacings, cell elongation, gap junctional membrane distribution, and local cellular disarray were altered without changing the dominant directions of cell alignment in individual subregions.

{"title": "Physiological function and transplantation of scaffold-free and vascularized human cardiac muscle tissue.", "abstract": "Success of human myocardial tissue engineering for cardiac repair has been limited by adverse effects of scaffold materials, necrosis at the tissue core, and poor survival after transplantation due to ischemic injury. Here, we report the development of scaffold-free prevascularized human heart tissue that survives in vivo transplantation and integrates with the host coronary circulation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated to cardiomyocytes by using activin A and BMP-4 and then placed into suspension on a rotating orbital shaker to create human cardiac tissue patches. Optimization of patch culture medium significantly increased cardiomyocyte viability in patch centers. These patches, composed only of enriched cardiomyocytes, did not survive to form significant grafts after implantation in vivo. To test the hypothesis that ischemic injury after transplantation would be attenuated by accelerated angiogenesis, we created \"second-generation,\" prevascularized, and entirely human patches from cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (both human umbilical vein and hESC-derived endothelial cells), and fibroblasts. Functionally, vascularized patches actively contracted, could be electrically paced, and exhibited passive mechanics more similar to myocardium than patches comprising only cardiomyocytes. Implantation of these patches resulted in 10-fold larger cell grafts compared with patches composed only of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the preformed human microvessels anastomosed with the rat host coronary circulation and delivered blood to the grafts. Thus, inclusion of vascular and stromal elements enhanced the in vitro performance of engineered human myocardium and markedly improved viability after transplantation.

{"title": "Elucidation of the mechanism of mitochondrial iron loading in Friedreich's ataxia by analysis of a mouse mutant.", "abstract": "We used the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) conditional frataxin knockout mouse to elucidate how frataxin deficiency alters iron metabolism. This is of significance because frataxin deficiency leads to Friedreich's ataxia, a disease marked by neurologic and cardiologic degeneration. Using cardiac tissues, we demonstrate that frataxin deficiency leads to down-regulation of key molecules involved in 3 mitochondrial utilization pathways: iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis (iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein1/2 and the cysteine desulferase Nfs1), mitochondrial iron storage (mitochondrial ferritin), and heme synthesis (5-aminolevulinate dehydratase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, and ferrochelatase). This marked decrease in mitochondrial iron utilization and resultant reduced release of heme and ISC from the mitochondrion could contribute to the excessive mitochondrial iron observed. This effect is compounded by increased iron availability for mitochondrial uptake through (i) transferrin receptor1 up-regulation, increasing iron uptake from transferrin; (ii) decreased ferroportin1 expression, limiting iron export; (iii) increased expression of the heme catabolism enzyme heme oxygenase1 and down-regulation of ferritin-H and -L, both likely leading to increased \"free iron\" for mitochondrial uptake; and (iv) increased expression of the mammalian exocyst protein Sec15l1 and the mitochondrial iron importer mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn2), which facilitate cellular iron uptake and mitochondrial iron influx, respectively.

The disease manifests as polyarthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema marginatum, and/or subcutaneous nodules. Carditis, the most serious complication, occurs in 30% to 45% of RF patients and leads to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which is characterized by progressive and permanent valvular lesions. In this review, we will focus on the genes that confer susceptibility for developing the disease, as well as the innate and adaptive immune responses against S. pyogenes during the acute rheumatic fever episode that leads to RHD autoimmune reactions.\nThe disease is genetically determined, and some human leukocyte antigen class II alleles are involved with susceptibility. Other single nucleotide polymorphisms for TNF-alpha and mannan-binding lectin genes were reported as associated with RF/RHD. T cells play an important role in RHD heart lesions. Several autoantigens were already identified, including cardiac myosin epitopes, vimentin, and other intracellular proteins. In the heart tissue, antigen-driven oligoclonal T cell expansions were probably the effectors of the rheumatic heart lesions. These cells are CD4(+) and produced inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IFNgamma).\nMolecular mimicry is the mechanism that mediated the cross-reactions between streptococcal antigens and human proteins.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate sympathetic nerves in the cardiac conduction system as well as in the walls of all four heart chambers in patients with PD, in incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD), and in controls. Heart tissue from five PD patients, two iLBD cases, and seven controls were investigated immunohistochemically using antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and alpha-synuclein (syn-1). A marked diminution of TH immunoreactivity (IR) within nerve fibers was observed in four PD patients and in both individuals with iLBD. In contrast, all control subjects displayed dense TH-IR nerve structures. The depletion in TH-IR involved not only the ventricles, but also the conduction system and the atrium showing a global change within cardiac TH-IR nerve fibers in the course of PD. In conclusion, the alterations in cardiac sympathetic nerves of patients with PD or in individuals with iLBD are homogeneous and global within the heart.

By utilizing commercial aquaria, we estimated (15)N and (13)C of muscle, liver, vertebral cartilage and a number of organs of three large sand tiger (Carcharias taurus) and one large lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) under a controlled feeding regime. For all sharks mean+/-SD for (15)N and (13)C in lipid extracted muscle using lipid extracted prey data were 2.29 per thousand+/-0.22 and 0.90 per thousand+/-0.33, respectively. The use of non-lipid extracted muscle and prey resulted in very similar (15)N and (13)C values but mixing of lipid and non-lipid extracted data produced variable estimates. Values of (15)N and (13)C in lipid extracted liver and prey were 1.50 per thousand+/-0.54 and 0.22 per thousand+/-1.18, respectively. Non-lipid extracted diet discrimination factors in liver were highly influenced by lipid content and studies that examine stable isotopes in shark liver, and likely any high lipid tissue, should strive to remove lipid effects through standardising C:N ratios, prior to isotope analysis. Mean vertebral cartilage (15)N and (13)C values were 1.45 per thousand+/-0.61 and 3.75 per thousand+/-0.44, respectively.

Modern-day ICD systems use transvenous high-voltage leads to act as the interface between the heart and the generator, allowing for the sensing of a cardiac activity and the delivery of both bradycardia and tachycardia therapy, including high-voltage, high-current shocks. The ICD lead is in many ways the most fragile and critical component of the ICD system, and is subjected to more stress than any other implanted medical device. It has similar components to a pacing lead including tip and ring electrodes, fixation mechanism, conductors, insulators, and connector pins. In addition, it also contains the high-voltage shock coils that allow the delivery of defibrillation therapy to the cardiac tissue. The materials used to manufacture each of these components have undergone little evolution from their initial pacing lead-derived origin, but promising progress in this area is now occurring and better conductors and insulators have been developed. Lead body design continues to be multiluminal rather than coaxial, but various iterations of this basic paradigm continue to be investigated. In addition to miniaturization of the entire ICD lead, new industry standard lead connectors will also be introduced to reduce complexity and pocket bulk. However, long-term failure rates have been considerable, with lead failure related to both conductor and insulator malfunction.

Despite data from a number of in vitro studies of TTR amyloidogenesis, many questions, including where and how these fibrils form in vivo and what is the impact of amyloid deposition on tissues, remain unanswered. Here, we analysed the relationship between amyloid fibril formation and micro-environmental changes by using autopsy cardiac tissues from 11 patients with FAP and a smooth muscle cell line. Ultrastructural studies of cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells showed that amyloid fibrils formed first at the basement membrane and that amorphous non-fibrillar TTR deposits and premature fibrils predominated during the early stage of amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that expression of major components of the basement membrane, such as collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin, increased in parallel with the accumulation of TTR amyloid fibrils. In vitro studies with a vascular smooth muscle cell line revealed that synthetic TTR aggregates increased expression of these basement membrane components. Serum levels of collagen IV in FAP patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls.

While some clinical trials have been encouraging, there have also been failures and there is little understanding of the multiplicity of factors that lead to the outcome. In this overview paper, the opportunities and challenges in applying biophotonic techniques to regenerative medicine, exemplified by the challenge of stem cell therapy of ischemic heart disease, are considered. The focus is on optical imaging to track stem cell distribution and fate, and optical spectroscopies and/or imaging to monitor the structural remodeling of the tissue and the resulting functional changes.

{"title": "Application of DENSE-MR-elastography to the human heart.", "abstract": "Typically, MR-elastography (MRE) encodes the propagation of monochromatic acoustic waves in the MR-phase images via sinusoidal gradients characterized by a detection frequency equal to the frequency of the mechanical vibration. Therefore, the echo time of a conventional MRE sequence is typically longer than the vibration period which is critical for heart tissue exhibiting a short T(2). Thus, fast acquisition techniques like the so-called fractional encoding of harmonic motions were developed for cardiac applications. However, fractional encoding of harmonic motions is limited since it is two orders of magnitude less sensitive to motion than conventional MRE sequences for low-frequency vibrations. Here, a new sequence is derived from the so-called displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) sequence. This sequence is more sensitive to displacement than fractional encoding of harmonic motions, and its spectral specificity is equivalent to conventional MRE sequences. The theoretical spectral properties of this new motion-encoding technique are validated in a phantom and excised pork heart specimen. An excellent agreement is found for the measured displacement fields using classic MRE and displacement encoding with stimulated echoes MRE (8% maximum difference). In addition, initial in vivo results on a healthy volunteer clearly show propagating shear waves at 50 Hz. Thus, displacement encoding with stimulated echoes MRE is a promising technique for motion encoding within short T(2)* materials.", "journal": "Magnetic resonance in medicine", "date": "2009-09-26", "authors": ["BenjaminRobert", "RalphSinkus", "Jean-LucGennisson", "MathiasFink"], "doi": "10.1002/mrm.22124"}
{"title": "Validation of the cardiosphere method to culture cardiac progenitor cells from myocardial tissue.", "abstract": "At least four laboratories have shown that endogenous cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) can be grown directly from adult heart tissue in primary culture, as cardiospheres or their progeny (cardiosphere-derived cells, CDCs). Indeed, CDCs are already being tested in a clinical trial for cardiac regeneration. Nevertheless, the validity of the cardiosphere strategy to generate CPCs has been called into question by reports based on variant methods. In those reports, cardiospheres are argued to be cardiomyogenic only because of retained cardiomyocytes, and stem cell activity has been proposed to reflect hematological contamination. We use a variety of approaches (including genetic lineage tracing) to show that neither artifact is applicable to cardiospheres and CDCs grown using established methods, and we further document the stem cell characteristics (namely, clonogenicity and multilineage potential) of CDCs.\nCPCs were expanded from human endomyocardial biopsies (n = 160), adult bi-transgenic MerCreMer-Z/EG mice (n = 6), adult C57BL/6 mice (n = 18), adult GFP(+) C57BL/6 transgenic mice (n = 3), Yucatan mini pigs (n = 67), adult SCID beige mice (n = 8), and adult Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 80). Cellular yield was enhanced by collagenase digestion and process standardization; yield was reduced in altered media and in specific animal strains. Heparinization/retrograde organ perfusion did not alter the ability to generate outgrowth from myocardial sample. The initial outgrowth from myocardial samples was enriched for sub-populations of CPCs (c-Kit(+)), endothelial cells (CD31(+), CD34(+)), and mesenchymal cells (CD90(+)). Lineage tracing using MerCreMer-Z/EG transgenic mice revealed that the presence of cardiomyocytes in the cellular outgrowth is not required for the generation of CPCs. Rat CDCs are shown to be clonogenic, and cloned CDCs exhibit spontaneous multineage potential.\nThis study demonstrates that direct culture and expansion of CPCs from myocardial tissue is simple, straightforward, and reproducible when appropriate techniques are used.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-09-26", "authors": ["Darryl RDavis", "YiqiangZhang", "Rachel RSmith", "KeCheng", "JohnTerrovitis", "KonstantinosMalliaras", "Tao-ShengLi", "AnthonyWhite", "RajMakkar", "EduardoMarb\u00e1n"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0007195\n10.1371/journal.pone.0001929"}

The EF5-positive tissues were also specifically positive for nuclear-localized hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), the oxygen-sensitive component of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) heterodimer. This led to our hypothesis that there is a \"template\" of hypoxic tissue that determines the stereotyped pattern of the major coronary vessels. In this study, we disturbed this template by altering ambient oxygen levels (hypoxia 15%; hyperoxia 75-40%) during the early phases of avian coronary vessel development, in order to alter tissue hypoxia, HIF-1alpha protein expression, and its downstream target genes without high mortality. We also altered HIF-1alpha gene expression in the embryonic outflow tract cardiomyocytes by injecting an adenovirus containing a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha (AdCA5). We assayed for coronary anomalies using anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistology. When incubated under abnormal oxygen levels or injected with a low titer of the AdCA5, coronary arteries displayed deviations from their normal proximal connections to the aorta. These deviations were similar to known clinical anomalies of coronary arteries. These findings indicated that developing coronary vessels may be subject to a level of regulation that is dependent on differential oxygen levels within cardiac tissues and subsequent HIF-1 regulation of gene expression.", "journal": "Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists", "date": "2009-09-25", "authors": ["JamieWikenheiser", "Julie AWolfram", "MadhusudhanaGargesha", "KeYang", "GangaKarunamuni", "David LWilson", "Gregg LSemenza", "FatonAgani", "Steven AFisher", "NicoleWard", "MichikoWatanabe"], "doi": "10.1002/dvdy.22089"}
{"title": "Causes of abnormal Ca2+ transients in Guinea pig pathophysiological ventricular muscle revealed by Ca2+ and action potential imaging at cellular level.", "abstract": "Abnormal Ca(2+) transients are often observed in heart muscles under a variety of pathophysiological conditions including ventricular tachycardia. To clarify whether these abnormal Ca(2+) transients can be attributed to abnormal action potential generation or abnormal Ca(2+) handling/excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, we developed a procedure to determine Ca(2+) and action potential signals at the cellular level in isolated heart tissues.\nAfter loading ventricular papillary muscle with rhod-2 and di-4-ANEPPS, mono-wavelength fluorescence images from rhod-2 and ratiometric images of two wavelengths of emission from di-4-ANEPPS were sequentially obtained. To mimic the ventricular tachycardia, the ventricular muscles were field-stimulated in non-flowing Krebs solution which elicited abnormal Ca(2+) transients. For the failed and alternating Ca(2+) transient generation, there were two types of causes, i.e., failed or abnormal action potential generation and abnormal EC coupling. In cells showing delayed initiation of Ca(2+) transients with field stimulation, action potential onset was delayed and the rate of rise was slower than in healthy cells. Similar delayed onset was also observed in the presence of heptanol, an inhibitor of gap junction channels but having a non-specific channel blocking effect. A Na(+) channel blocker, on the other hand, reduced the rate of rise of the action potentials but did not result in desynchronization of the action potentials. The delayed onset of action potentials can be explained primarily by impaired gap junctions and partly by Na(+) channel inactivation.\nOur results indicate that there are multiple patterns for the causes of abnormal Ca(2+) signals and that our methods are useful for investigating the physiology and pathophysiology of heart muscle.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2009-09-22", "authors": ["HirotoNishizawa", "TakeshiSuzuki", "TakaoShioya", "YujiNakazato", "HiroyukiDaida", "NagomiKurebayashi"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0007069"}

During treatment, cardiotoxicity caused by cell damage due to the free oxygen radicals that are generated is a major limiting factor. This study was undertaken to determine whether DXR-induced cardiotoxicity could be prevented by natural foods with antioxidant properties such as aged garlic extract (AGEX), grape seed proanthocyanidin (PA), and hazelnut. Wistar albino male rats were assigned randomly to 9 groups each consisting of 15 rats. AGEX, PA, and hazelnut groups received these antioxidants in addition to their standard rat diet. They were also treated with cumulative intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections according to 2 different regimens: either a high-dose of 15 mg/kg DXR (3.75 mg/kg per week for 4 weeks) or a low-dose of 7.5 mg/kg DXR (1.875 mg/kg per week for 4 weeks). The control group received i.p. 0.9% saline. AGEX, PA, or hazelnut supplements were given orally to the groups for a 6-week period starting 1 week before the DXR treatment and ending 1 week after the treatment. One week after the last DXR injection, heart tissue samples were analyzed to determine malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and xanthine oxidase (XO) levels, and serum samples were taken for creatine kinase (CK). There were no significant changes in MDA levels among the control, DXR-treated groups, or supplemented groups that received additional natural antioxidant foods. SOD enzyme levels were decreased in rats treated with DXR. PA prevented the decrease at low doses of DXR. DXR treatment decreased CAT enzyme levels, but additional PA and hazelnut consumption increased these levels at low cumulative doses. XO enzyme levels were decreased in AGEX and hazelnut groups, but PA prevented the decrease. CK levels were elevated after DXR administration, indicating myocardial injury, but PA significantly reversed this. Although there were no differences histopathologically between AGEX, PA, and hazelnut groups, the protective effects of AGEX and PA were evident in electron microscopy. In conclusion, the positive effects of natural antioxidant foods on the prevention of DXR-induced cardiac injury could not be clearly shown on the basis of antioxidant enzymes. However, the electron microscopic changes clearly demonstrated the protective effects of AGEX and PA. The supplementation of these antioxidant foods over longer periods may show more definitive results.

Physiological acclimatization in populations across large-scale ecological gradients in habitat temperature fluctuation is an important factor to consider in detecting responses to climate change related increases in thermal fluctuation.

We observed acclimatization dependent induction of heat shock proteins, as well as unknown genes with heat shock protein-like expression profiles. Thermal acclimatization had the largest effect on heat stress responses of extensin-like, beta tubulin, and unknown genes. For these genes, crabs acclimatized to thermally variable sites had higher constitutive expression than specimens from low variability sites, but heat stress dramatically induced expression in specimens from low variability sites and repressed expression in specimens from highly variable sites.

Recently, it was claimed that bone marrow cells transdifferentiate, a much desired property as bone marrow cells are abundant and therefore could be used in regenerative medicine to treat incurable chronic diseases. Using a Cre/loxP system, we studied cell fusion after bone marrow transplantation. Fused cells were chiefly Gr-1(+), a myeloid cell marker, and found predominantly in the bone marrow; in parenchymal tissues. Surprisingly, fused cells were most abundant in the kidney, Peyer's patches, and cardiac tissue. In contrast, after cell fusion with embryonic stem cells, bone marrow cells were reprogrammed into new tetraploid pluripotent stem cells that successfully differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes. Together, these data suggest that cell fusion is ubiquitous after cellular transplants and that the subsequent sharing of genetic material between the fusion partners affects cellular survival and function.

{"title": "Variable optimization for the formation of three-dimensional self-organized heart muscle.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue-engineering research is focused on the development of functional three-dimensional (3D) heart muscle in vitro. These models allow the detailed study of critical events in organogenesis, such as the establishment of cell-cell communication and construction and modification of the extracellular matrix. We have previously described a model for 3D heart muscle, termed cardioids, formed by the spontaneous delamination of a cohesive monolayer of primary cells in the absence of any synthetic scaffolding material. In an earlier publication, we have shown that, upon electrical stimulation, cardioids generate a twitch force in the range of 200-300 microN, generate a specific force (twitch force normalized to total cross-sectional area) of 2-4 kN/m(2), and can be electrically paced at frequencies of up to 10 Hz without any notable fatigue. We have two objectives for the current study: model development and model optimization. Our model development efforts are focused on providing additional characterization of the cardioid model. In this study, we show for the first time that cardioids show a pattern of gene expression comparable to that of cells cultured in two dimensions on tissue culture plastic and normal mammalian heart muscle. Compared with primary cardiac cells cultured on tissue culture plastic, the expression of alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC), beta-MHC, SERCA2, and phospholamban was significantly higher in cardioids. Our second objective, model optimization, is focused on evaluating the effect of several cell culture variables on cardioid formation and function. Specifically, we looked at the effect of plating density (1.0-4.0 x 10(6) cells per cardioid), concentration of two adhesion proteins (laminin at 0.2-2.0 microg/cm(2) and fibronectin at 1-10 microg/cm(2)), myocyte purity (using preplating times of 15 and 60 min), and ascorbic acid stimulation (1-100 microl/ml). For our optimization studies, we utilized twitch force in response to electrical stimulation as our endpoint metric. Based on these studies, we found that cardioids formed with a plating density in the range 3-4 x 10(6) cells per cardioid generated the maximum twitch force, whereas increasing the surface adhesion protein (using either laminin or fibronectin) and increasing the myocyte purity both resulted in a decrease in twitch force. In addition, increasing the ascorbic acid concentration resulted in an increase in the baseline force of cardioids, which was recorded in the absence of electrical stimulation. Based on the model development studies, we have shown that cardioids do indeed exhibit a gene expression pattern similar to normal mammalian heart muscle. This provides further validity for the cardioid model. Based on the model optimization studies, we have identified specific cell culture regimes which support cardioid formation and function. These results are specific to the cardioid model; however, they may be translated and applied to other tissue-engineering models. Collectively, the work described in this study provides insight into the formation of functional 3D heart muscle and the effect of several cell culture variables on tissue formation and function.", "journal": "In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Group-IV rats were treated LMW-GAG plus ISO (300 microg/day per rat SC for 1 week followed by 85 mg/kg ISO on the end last two days of the 2 - weeks). Untreated control (Group-I) and LMW-GAG drug control (Group-II) were also included. Serum and tissue lactate dehydrogenase, aminotransferases, and creatine kinase activities were increased in ISO group, which were normalized by LMW-GAG pretreatment rats. Antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and non-enzymatic enzyme reduced glutathione (GSH) were decreased in the ISO induced rats, and this was increased by LMW-GAG pretreatment. Increased level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma and the heart of ISO treated rats; pre s.c. injected with LMW-GAG to ISO-induced rats decreased the levels of TBARS. Histological examination revealed that the ISO-induced deleterious changes in the heart tissues were offset by LMW-GAG treatment.

In 3 branches of a large South African Afrikaner pedigree with an autosomal-dominant form of PFHBI, we identified the mutation c.19G-->A in the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 4 gene (TRPM4) at chromosomal locus 19q13.3. This mutation predicted the amino acid substitution p.E7K in the TRPM4 amino terminus. TRPM4 encodes a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation (CAN) channel that belongs to the transient receptor potential melastatin ion channel family. Quantitative analysis of TRPM4 mRNA content in human cardiac tissue showed the highest expression level in Purkinje fibers. Cellular expression studies showed that the c.19G-->A missense mutation attenuated deSUMOylation of the TRPM4 channel. The resulting constitutive SUMOylation of the mutant TRPM4 channel impaired endocytosis and led to elevated TRPM4 channel density at the cell surface.

Alternative splicing modulates proteomic composition of Ca(v)1.2 to generate functional variation between channel isoforms. Here, we describe expression and function of Ca(v)1.2 channels containing alternatively spliced exon 9* in cerebral artery myocytes. RT-PCR showed expression of Ca(v)1.2 splice variants both containing (alpha(1)C(9/9*/10)) and lacking (alpha(1)C(9/10)) exon 9* in intact rabbit and human cerebral arteries. With the use of laser capture microdissection and RT-PCR, expression of mRNA for both alpha(1)C(9/9*/10) and alpha(1)C(9/10) was demonstrated in isolated cerebral artery myocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed significantly greater alpha(1)C(9/9*/10) expression relative to alpha(1)C(9/10) in intact rabbit cerebral arteries compared with cardiac tissue and cerebral cortex. To demonstrate a functional role for alpha(1)C(9/9*/10), smooth muscle of intact cerebral arteries was treated with antisense oligonucleotides targeting alpha(1)C(9/9*/10) (alpha(1)C(9/9*/10)-AS) or exon 9 (alpha(1)C-AS), expressed in all Ca(v)1.2 splice variants, by reversible permeabilization and organ cultured for 1-4 days. Treatment with alpha(1)C(9/9*/10)-AS reduced maximal constriction induced by elevated extracellular K(+) ([K(+)](o)) by approximately 75% compared with alpha(1)C(9/9*/10-)sense-treated arteries. Maximal constriction in response to the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin and [K(+)](o) EC(50) values were not altered by antisense treatment. Decreases in maximal [K(+)](o)-induced constriction were similar between alpha(1)C(9/9*/10)-AS and alpha(1)C-AS groups (22.7 + or - 9% and 25.6 + or - 4% constriction, respectively).

Recently, we have reported that KChIP2 functionally modulates the cardiac Ca(V)1.2-governed L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) through a direct interaction between KChIP2 and the amino-terminus of Ca(V)1.2.

Although I(to,f) is absent and I(Ca,L) is decreased in myocytes from KChIP2(-/-) mice, the action potential morphology is not altered. Furthermore, we show that the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) is comparable in wild-type (53 +/- 5 ms) and KChIP2(-/-) mice (48 +/- 3 ms; p > 0.05).

Genome-wide linkage analysis was used to identify a disease locus, followed by fine mapping and positional candidate gene sequencing. Mutation scanning was then performed in 278 unrelated subjects with idiopathic DCM, prospectively identified at the Mayo Clinic.\nOverlapping loci for DCM were independently mapped to chromosome 10q25-q26. Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing of affected individuals in each family revealed distinct heterozygous missense mutations in exon 9 of RBM20, encoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) binding motif protein 20. Comprehensive coding sequence analyses identified missense mutations clustered within this same exon in 6 additional DCM families. Mutations segregated with DCM (peak composite logarithm of the odds score >11.49), were absent in 480 control samples, and altered residues within a highly conserved arginine/serine (RS)-rich region. Expression of RBM20 messenger RNA was confirmed in human heart tissue.\nOur findings establish RBM20 as a DCM gene and reveal a mutation hotspot in the RS domain. RBM20 is preferentially expressed in the heart and encodes motifs prototypical of spliceosome proteins that regulate alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing, thus implicating a functionally distinct gene in human cardiomyopathy.

Primary rat cardiomyocytes were transduced with simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg), or with Bmi-1 followed by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene; the cells were expanded; and the transduced genes were removed by adenoviral vector expressing Cre recombinase. The TAg gene was more efficient in cell transduction than the Bmi-1/hTERT gene, based on the rate of cell proliferation. Immortalized cells exhibited the morphological features of dedifferentiation (increased vimentin expression, and reduced expression of troponin I and Nkx2.5) along with the continued expression of cardiac markers (alpha-actin, connexin-43, and calcium transients). After the immortalization was reversed, cells returned to their differentiated state.

However, the associations among ECG morphologies and the repolarization heterogeneities are still not clear.\nA cell-to-ECG model has been built by our group to study relationship between multiple factors of ion channels on the heart tissue and ECG morphology changes measured on the torso. More specifically, we varied both transmural (from Epi to Endo myocardium layers) and apex-to-base heterogeneities by blocking rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (Ikr), slow delayed rectifier potassium current (Iks), and late sodium current (InaL) with different extents on Epi, M, and Endo myocardium. On ECG measurement part, the study was focused on some new morphology-related features including T-peak to T-end (TpTe) interval, T wave flatness, T wave symmetric, and T wave notch. Two types of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) were created: global and localized heterogeneities. Vector magnitude and principal component-based composite leads were formed from multiple chest leads for robustness against large variation of individual lead due to placement and noise issues. Cross-correlation methods were used to determine the relationship of the new ECG morphology features with the heterogeneities. All the ECG morphology measurements were first analyzed with the cell-to-ECG model and then validated with previously acquired clinical trial ECG data (d-sotalol).\nThe results based on our cell-to-ECG model showed that the new TpTe interval of the composite signal based on V2, V3, and V4 leads has the correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.98 with the simulated global and localized TDR, respectively, highest among other tested ECG parameters. The combined T wave morphology score has the correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.92 with the simulated global and localized TDR, respectively. The validation results of d-sotalol show that new TpTe measurement has a correlation coefficient of 0.90 with plasma concentration, and the parameter's correlation with heart rate is 0.02.\nThe study provided preliminary results showing the usefulness of the cell-to-ECG model for studying relationship between multiple ion-channel factors with ECG morphology changes.

Originally, iPS were induced by a stemness-related gene set that included the c-MYC oncogene.\nHere, we determined from embryo to adult the cardiogenic proficiency of iPS programmed without c-MYC, a cardiogenicity-associated transcription factor.\nTransgenic expression of 3 human stemness factors SOX2, OCT4, and KLF4 here reset murine fibroblasts to the pluripotent ground state. Transduction without c-MYC reversed cellular ultrastructure into a primitive archetype and induced stem cell markers generating 3-germ layers, all qualifiers of acquired pluripotency. Three-factor induced iPS (3F-iPS) clones reproducibly demonstrated cardiac differentiation properties characterized by vigorous beating activity of embryoid bodies and robust expression of cardiac Mef2c, alpha-actinin, connexin43, MLC2a, and troponin I. In vitro isolated iPS-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrated functional excitation-contraction coupling. Chimerism with 3F-iPS derived by morula-stage diploid aggregation was sustained during prenatal heart organogenesis and contributed in vivo to normal cardiac structure and overall performance in adult tumor-free offspring.\nThus, 3F-iPS bioengineered without c-MYC achieve highest stringency criteria for bona fide cardiogenesis enabling reprogrammed fibroblasts to yield de novo heart tissue compatible with native counterpart throughout embryological development and into adulthood.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2009-08-22", "authors": ["AlmudenaMartinez-Fernandez", "Timothy JNelson", "SatsukiYamada", "SantiagoReyes", "Alexey EAlekseev", "CarmenPerez-Terzic", "YasuhiroIkeda", "AndreTerzic"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.203109"}
{"title": "p53 improves aerobic exercise capacity and augments skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA content.", "abstract": "Exercise capacity is a physiological characteristic associated with protection from both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. p53 regulates mitochondrial function and its deletion markedly diminishes exercise capacity, but the underlying genetic mechanism orchestrating this is unclear. Understanding the biology of how p53 improves exercise capacity may provide useful insights for improving both cardiovascular as well as general health.\nThe purpose of this study was to understand the genetic mechanism by which p53 regulates aerobic exercise capacity.\nUsing a variety of physiological, metabolic, and molecular techniques, we further characterized maximum exercise capacity and the effects of training, measured various nonmitochondrial and mitochondrial determinants of exercise capacity, and examined putative regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. As p53 did not affect baseline cardiac function or inotropic reserve, we focused on the involvement of skeletal muscle and now report a wider role for p53 in modulating skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. p53 interacts with Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded gene important for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and maintenance, and regulates mtDNA content. The increased mtDNA in p53(+/+) compared to p53(-/-) mice was more marked in aerobic versus glycolytic skeletal muscle groups with no significant changes in cardiac tissue. These in vivo observations were further supported by in vitro studies showing overexpression of p53 in mouse myoblasts increases both TFAM and mtDNA levels whereas depletion of TFAM by shRNA decreases mtDNA content.\nOur current findings indicate that p53 promotes aerobic metabolism and exercise capacity by using different mitochondrial genes and mechanisms in a tissue-specific manner.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2009-08-22", "authors": ["Joon-YoungPark", "Ping-YuanWang", "TakumiMatsumoto", "Ho JoongSung", "WenzheMa", "Jeong WChoi", "Stasia AAnderson", "Scot CLeary", "Robert SBalaban", "Ju-GyeongKang", "Paul MHwang"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.205310"}

Several cell therapies by direct injection have been already clinically performed. However, significant cell loss due to physical strain, primary hypoxia or cell wash-out has become problematic. To overcome this obstacle, tissue engineered myocardial patch transplantation has been examined as the second generation cell therapy. Furthermore several research groups have challenged to engineer pulsatile myocardial tissues/organs using beating cardiomyocytes. Among several tissue engineering technologies, we have developed cell sheet-based tissue engineering, which utilize two-dimensional (2-D) cell sheets harvested from temperature-responsive culture surfaces and create three-dimensional (3-D) tissues by stacking cell sheets without generally utilized scaffolds. Several types of cell sheet-based patches have improved damaged heart function in rat, canine and pig models. Stacked cardiomyocyte sheets simultaneously beat in macroscopic view both in vitro and in vivo and revealed characteristic structures of native heart tissue. As a possible solution for scaling up, multi-step transplantation of triple-layer cell sheets was performed and finally, 10-time transplantations have realized about 1 mm-thick functional myocardial tissue. As further advanced therapy, functional myocardial tubes have been also engineered by wrapping cell sheets.

Tissue samples were collected, either snap frozen (LN), subjected to TT, or snap frozen followed by thermal treatment, and subsequently analysed by 2-DE.

In brain tissue, 189 proteins were significantly differentially expressed across the three treatment groups (ANOVA, p<0.05).

Here we investigate whether mature adipocyte-derived dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells can differentiate to cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo by establishing DFAT cell lines via ceiling culture of mature adipocytes. DFAT cells were obtained by dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes from GFP-transgenic rats. We evaluated the differentiating ability of DFAT cells into cardiomyocytes by detection of the cardiac phenotype markers in immunocytochemical and RT-PCR analyses in vitro. We also examined effects of the transplantation of DFAT cells into the infarcted heart of rats on cardiomyocytes regeneration and angiogenesis. DFAT cells expressed cardiac phenotype markers when cocultured with cardiomyocytes and also when grown in MethoCult medium in the absence of cardiomyocytes, indicating that DFAT cells have the potential to differentiate to cardiomyocyte lineage. In a rat acute myocardial infarction model, transplanted DFAT cells were efficiently accumulated in infarcted myocardium and expressed cardiac sarcomeric actin at 8 weeks after the cell transplantation. The transplantation of DFAT cells significantly (p<0.05) increased capillary density in the infarcted area when compared with hearts from saline-injected control rats. We demonstrated that DFAT cells have the ability to differentiate to cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro and in vivo.

The tests were used to determine sulphamethazine (SMZ) residues in edible tissues of rabbit after oral administration up to day 15 of the withdrawal period (WP). A solvent extraction procedure was used to enhance the capability of the tests to detect SMZ residues at or below the maximum residue limit (MRL). Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was employed to previously identify SMZ residues in the first stage of the residue screening. The presence of SMZ residues in the samples was confirmed and quantified by a validated HPLC method. The Premi(R)Test detected SMZ residues in the muscle and heart tissue up to day 9 of the WP, and in the liver, lungs and kidneys up to day 10 of the WP. The STAR detected SMZ residues in the edible organs of rabbits up to day 8 of the WP. The kidneys were positive up to day 5 of the WP, the liver until day 4 of the WP and the lungs until day 3 of the WP. No SMZ residues were detected in the muscle and heart. By using the solvent extraction procedure, SMZ residues were detected in the muscle extract up to day 10 of the WP and the muscle was positive until day 6 of the WP. No detection sensitivity was observed using the FPT. After solvent extraction, SMZ residues were detected in the muscle extract until day 8 of the WP and the muscle was positive until day 3 of the WP. No positive results were detected after the addition of PABA into/onto the agar medium. PABA at a concentration of 10 microg ml(-1) completely reversed the inhibitory activity of SMZ and enabled reliable identification of SMZ in the examined samples.

Compared with the control, infarcted mice showed increased content, mRNA and protein expression of IMD in plasma and cardiac tissue. The mRNA expression of the receptor activity-modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) gene increased very early, and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor and RAMP2 mRNA levels increased later after reperfusion. However, the RAMP1 gene expression did not change. The tissue IMD content was positively correlated with the diastolic blood pressure and negatively correlated with pulse pressure. In addition, exogenous IMD treatment significantly ameliorated the MI/R injury by rescuing the pulse pressure, inhibiting neutrophil infiltration in the peri-infarction area, and decreasing the creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in plasma.

The percentage of CD11c+ mDC on cultured cells and mean fluorescence index (MFI) of double positive cells (CD11c+CD40+, CD11c+CD80+) were measured by flow cytometry. The expression of chemokine receptors (CCR5, CCR7) on mDC and chemokines (CCL4, CCL19) in the myocardium was detected. The migration of mDC in response to CCL4 or CCL19 was measured by chemotaxis assay. Mature mDC were elevated in the myocardium from CVB3-infected mice. The percentage of mDC generated from CVB3-infected group was increased. The MFI of CD11c+CD40+ and CD11c+CD80+ was increased in CVB3-infected group. The mDC showed a down-regulation of CCR5 and unaffected CCR7 mRAN levels associated with elevated CCL4 and CCL19 in the myocardium in CVB3-infected group. Numbers of migrating bone marrow-derived mDC from CVB3-infected mice were increased in vitro. We conclude that CVB3 infection induced the greater generation of mDC from bone marrow and accumulation of mature mDC in myocardial tissues. This migration was associated with increased levels of both CCL4 and CCL19 in the heart tissue. These suggest that blocking the migration of mDC may provide a novel therapy for myocarditis.", "journal": "International immunopharmacology", "date": "2009-08-12", "authors": ["PingChen", "RuizhenChen", "YingzhenYang", "YongYu", "YeqingXie", "YunzengZou", "JunboGe", "HaozhuChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2009.07.014"}
{"title": "Viral causes of human myocarditis.", "abstract": "The diagnosis of acute myocarditis is complex and challenging. The use of the Dallas criteria in the diagnosis of myocarditis is associated with poor sensitivity and specificity because of the sampling error related to the often focal distribution of the specific histological lesions in cardiac tissue and the variability in pathological interpretation. To improve histological diagnosis, additional virological evaluation of cardiac tissues is required, with immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques allowing identification and quantification of viral infection markers. The diagnostic gold standard is endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with the histological Dallas criteria, in association with new immunohistochemical and PCR analyses of cardiac tissues. Using real-time PCR and reverse transcription PCR assays, parvovirus B19, Coxsackie B virus, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) type B and adenovirus have been detected in 37, 33, 11 and 8% of EMB, respectively, from young adults (aged<35 years) with histologically proven acute myocarditis. Viral co-infections have also been found in 12% of acute myocarditis cases, generally parvovirus B19 plus HHV-6. Moreover, herpesviruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus can also be associated with myocarditis after heart transplantation. During the clinical course of myocarditis, the immunohistochemical detection of enterovirus, adenovirus or parvovirus B19 capsid proteins or herpesvirus late proteins is necessary to differentiate a viral cardiac infection with replication activities from a persistent or latent cardiac infection. These new viral diagnostic approaches can lead to better identification of the aetiology of myocarditis and may therefore enable the development and evaluation of specific aetiology-directed treatment strategies.", "journal": "Archives of cardiovascular diseases", "date": "2009-08-12", "authors": ["LaurentAndr\u00e9oletti", "NicolasL\u00e9v\u00eaque", "CamilleBoulagnon", "CamilleBrasselet", "PaulFornes"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acvd.2009.04.010"}
{"title": "The potential for interaction of hydrochlorothiazide with garlic in rats.", "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) with garlic homogenate (GH), in rats. The influence of garlic on pharmacokinetics of HCTZ was studied by HPLC method, while pharmacodynamic interaction was studied using diuretic activity, ECG and BP changes and isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial injury. HCTZ was given orally at 10mg/kg and GH was administered at three different doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o. The CK-MB, LDH, SOD, catalase and histopathological studies were carried out. The administration of HCTZ in GH pretreated rats found to decrease the QRS duration, RR interval, QT segment, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, serum potassium level, serum LDH and serum CK-MB activities significantly. The diuretic effect of HCTZ was significantly increased in presence of GH; however, kaliuresis was significantly reduced in presence of GH 250 mg/kg. Histopathological studies of heart tissue reveal the protective effect of GH 250 mg/kg in presence or absence of HCTZ during ISO stress to myocardium. The pharmacokinetic studies show that GH increases the bioavailability and half-life, along with decrease in clearance and elimination rate of HCTZ when administered orally. It was concluded that careful addition of garlic in moderate doses might result in beneficial effect during treatment of hypertension in patients with myocardial stress as garlic causes substantial fall in excretion of potassium when compared to HCTZ alone treatment in rats. This could be important in reducing the dose of HCTZ to achieve enhanced therapeutic effect with minimal adverse effect.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2009-08-08", "authors": ["Syed Mohammed BasheeruddinAsdaq", "Mohammed NaseeruddinInamdar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2009.07.022"}

A genomewide characterization of the molecular phenotype of hESC-derived cardiomyocytes is important for their envisioned applications. We have employed a lineage selection strategy to generate a pure population of cardiomyocytes (>99%) from transgenic hESC lines. Global gene expression profiling showed that these cardiomyocytes are distinct from pluripotent and differentiated hESC cultures. Pure cardiomyocytes displayed similarities with heart tissue, but in many aspects presented an individual transcriptome pattern. A subset of 1,311 cardiac-enriched transcripts was identified, which were significantly overpresented (p < .01) in the Gene Ontology (GO) categories of heart function and heart development. Focused analysis of the GO categories ion transport, sarcomere, and heart development uncovered a unique molecular signature of hESC cardiomyocytes. Pathway analysis revealed an extensive cardiac transcription factor network and novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling components within the cardiac-enriched genes. Notably, approximately 80% of these genes were previously uncharacterized. We have evaluated the biological relevance of four candidates-Rbm24, Tcea3, Fhod3, and C15orf52-by in situ hybridization during early mouse development and report that all were prominently expressed in cardiac structures.

Recently, cells derived from fetal membranes of human term placenta have raised strong interest in regenerative medicine for their stem cell potential and immunomodulatory features. Our study aimed to investigate the possible utility of amniotic membrane to limit postischemic cardiac injury. A fragment of human amniotic membrane was applied onto the left ventricle of rats that had undergone ischemia through left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Echocardiographic assessment of morphological and functional cardiac parameters was then performed over a 3-month period. We demonstrated that application of an amniotic membrane fragment onto ischemic rat hearts could significantly reduce postischemic cardiac dysfunction. The amniotic membrane-treated rats showed higher preservation of cardiac dimensions and improved cardiac contractile function in terms of higher left ventricle ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and wall thickening. These improvements were apparent by day 7 after application of the amniotic membrane, persisted for at least 2 months, and occurred independently of cardiac injury severity. No engraftment of amniotic cells was detected into host cardiac tissues.

{"title": "Transcatheter injection-induced changes in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.", "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are being administered by direct intramyocardial (IM) injection into patients with myocardial dysfunction with an objective to improve clinical status. However, surprisingly little attention has been directed to qualifying hMSC functionality beyond simple viability. In particular, the transit of hMSCs through a small-caliber needle lumen, the final fluidic pathway for all IM injection devices, may be especially prone to inducing unwarranted effects on cell function. This study evaluated the changes in clonogenicity, gene expression, and cytokine secretion that may be induced in hMSC (20 million/ml) by injection through a 26-gauge Nitinol needle at two different flow rates compared to noninjected control samples. Results indicated that hMSC viability and colony forming unit (CFU) formation was not altered by changes in injection rate, although a trend toward lower titers was noted at the higher flow rate, for the specific batch of hMSCs studied. The gene expression and cytokine analysis data suggest that delivering a suspension of MSCs through narrow lumen needles may marginally alter certain gene expression programs, but that such in vitro effects are transient and not translated into measurable differences in protein production. Gene expression levels of four cytokines (bFGF, SDF-1, SCF, VEGF) were significantly different at 400 microl/min, and that of all cytokines were significantly different at 1600 microl/min when compared to controls (p < 0.05). These changes were less pronounced (statistically insignificant for most cases, p > 0.05) and, in certain instances directionally opposite, at 72 h. However, no differences in the amounts of secreted bFGF, VEGF, or TGF-beta were detectable at either of the two time points or flow rates.

Mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed in many cell types of the cardiovascular system, including monocytes/macrophages and other inflammatory cell types. Although mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed in monocytes/macrophages, their role in regulating macrophage function to date has not been investigated. We, thus, used the Cre/LoxP-recombination system to selectively delete mineralocorticoid receptors from monocytes/macrophages with the lysozyme M promoter used to drive Cre expression (MR(flox/flox)/LysM(Cre/-) mice). Male mice from each genotype (MR(flox/flox) or wild-type and MR(flox/flox)/LysM(Cre/-) mice) were uninephrectomized, given 0.9% NaCl solution to drink, and treated for 8 days or 8 weeks with either vehicle (n=10) or deoxycorticosterone (n=10). Equivalent tissue macrophage numbers were seen for deoxycorticosterone treatment of each genotype at 8 days; in contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and NAD(P)H oxidase subunit 2 levels were increased in wild-type but not in MR(flox/flox)/LysM(Cre/-) mice given deoxycorticosterone. Baseline expression of other inflammatory genes was reduced in MR(flox/flox)/LysM(Cre/-) mice compared with wild-type mice.

These data demonstrate the following points: (1) mineralocorticoid receptor signaling regulates basal monocyte/macrophage function; (2) macrophage recruitment is not altered by loss of mineralocorticoid receptor signaling in these cells; and (3) a novel and significant role is seen for macrophage signaling in the regulation of cardiac remodeling and systolic blood pressure in the deoxycorticosterone/salt model.", "journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "date": "2009-07-29", "authors": ["Amanda JRickard", "JamesMorgan", "GregTesch", "John WFunder", "Peter JFuller", "Morag JYoung"], "doi": "10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.131110"}

{"title": "Acute postischemic treatment with estrogen receptor-alpha agonist or estrogen receptor-beta agonist improves myocardial recovery.", "abstract": "After ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, female hearts demonstrate improved functional recovery compared with male, which suggests a protective role for estrogen. Acute postischemic treatment with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) attenuates myocardial dysfunction. However, it is unknown by which estrogen receptor (ER) E2 mediates this acute cardioprotection during I/R. Therefore, we hypothesize that postischemic infusion of the selective ER-alpha agonist (4,4',4''-[4-propyl-(1H)-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl]tris-phenol [PPT]) or the selective ER-beta agonist (2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile [DPN]) will improve myocardial function after I/R injury.\nIsolated, perfused hearts (Langendorff) from adult male rats were subjected to 25 minutes of ischemia followed by 40 minutes of reperfusion. Hearts (n = 4-6 per group) were randomly infused with either perfusate, PPT or DPN at 1, 10, or 100 nmol/L throughout reperfusion. After I/R, heart tissue was analyzed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).\nPostischemic treatment with 10 nmol/L of PPT significantly improved myocardial function. Additionally, 10 or 100 nmol/L of DPN significantly increased myocardial functional recovery after I/R injury, with maximum benefit at the 10 nmol/L dose.

Eighteen hours after PE, there was significant upregulation of adhesion molecules (selectin E 18-fold; intercellular adhesion molecule 1 14-fold), influx of neutrophils (myeloperoxidase activity 21-fold), depressed RV function (RV peak systolic pressure = 24 +/- 3 vs. 40 +/- 1 mm Hg; maximum rate of pressure development = 444 +/- 79 vs. 1533 +/- 146; maximum rate of pressure decrease = -357 +/- 50 vs. -651 +/- 44), and release of cardiac troponin I (7.8 +/- 1.9 ng/mL) compared with vehicle. Ketorolac (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) significantly reduced expression of CINC-1, cyclooxygenase-2, selectin E, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, lowered neutrophil influx, improved RV function (RV peak systolic pressure was 34 +/- 3 mm Hg; maximum rate of pressure development = 1288 +/- 146; maximum rate of pressure decrease = -611 +/- 92), and marginally reduced cardiac troponin I release (P < 0.07) compared with PE alone.

{"title": "Purification of cardiac myocytes from human heart biopsies for gene expression analysis.", "abstract": "The collection of gene expression data from human heart biopsies is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of arrhythmias and diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Many clinical and basic research laboratories conduct gene expression analysis using RNA from whole cardiac biopsies. This allows for the analysis of global changes in gene expression in areas of the heart, while eliminating the need for more complex and technically difficult single-cell isolation procedures (such as flow cytometry, laser capture microdissection, etc.) that require expensive equipment and specialized training. The abundance of fibroblasts and other cell types in whole biopsies, however, can complicate gene expression analysis and the interpretation of results. Therefore, we have designed a technique to quickly and easily purify cardiac myocytes from whole cardiac biopsies for RNA extraction. Human heart tissue samples were collected, and our purification method was compared with the standard nonpurification method. Cell imaging using acridine orange staining of the purified sample demonstrated that >98% of total RNA was contained within identifiable cardiac myocytes. Real-time RT-PCR was performed comparing nonpurified and purified samples for the expression of troponin T (myocyte marker), vimentin (fibroblast marker), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (smooth muscle marker). Troponin T expression was significantly increased, and vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were significantly decreased in the purified sample (n = 8; P < 0.05). Extracted RNA was analyzed during each step of the purification, and no significant degradation occurred. These results demonstrate that this isolation method yields a more purified cardiac myocyte RNA sample suitable for downstream applications, such as real-time RT-PCR, and allows for more accurate gene expression changes in cardiac myocytes from heart biopsies.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Several injectable materials have been examined for cardiac tissue engineering; however, none have been designed specifically to mimic the myocardium. The goal of this study was to investigate the in vitro properties and in vivo potential of an injectable myocardial matrix designed to mimic the natural myocardial extracellular environment. Porcine myocardial tissue was decellularized and processed to form a myocardial matrix with the ability to gel in vitro at 37 degrees C and in vivo upon injection into rat myocardium. The resulting myocardial matrix maintained a complex composition, including glycosaminoglycan content, and was able to self-assemble to form a nanofibrous structure. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were shown to migrate towards the myocardial matrix both in vitro and in vivo, with a significant increase in arteriole formation at 11 days post-injection. The matrix was also successfully pushed through a clinically used catheter, demonstrating its potential for minimally invasive therapy.

To address this issue, we analysed whether a short treatment with a TNF-alpha blocker affected the course and characteristics of chronic disease in a rat experimental model of T. cruzi infection. An anti-TNF-alpha agent (infliximab) was administered during the chronic phase for a period of 4 weeks (3 mg/kg/week), while control infected rats were inoculated with saline physiological solution. Search for parasites yielded non-successful results in all infected groups, irrespective of treatment. Nevertheless, the presence of T. cruzi kDNA in heart tissue was detected in infected and infected plus treated animals. Because infliximab might induce changes in the anti-parasite cytokine response, circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-10, interferon-gamma and nitric oxide were evaluated. An increase in IL-10 levels was observed only in the infected group treated with the anti-TNF-alpha blocker compared to the remaining groups (P < 0.05). A clear attenuation of histological damage associated with a diminution of cardiac TNF-alpha mRNA expression was observed in the infected and treated animals compared to the infected and non-treated group.

Protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage should be an effective therapeutic strategy; however, conventional antioxidants are ineffective, because they cannot penetrate the mitochondria. This study investigated the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress during development of hypertension in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat, using the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ(10). Eight-week-old male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with MitoQ(10) (500 mumol/L; n=16), control compound decyltriphenylphosphonium (decylTPP; 500 mumol/L; n=8), or vehicle (n=9) in drinking water for 8 weeks.

{"title": "Coordinating the timing of cardiac precursor development during gastrulation: a new role for Notch signaling.", "abstract": "Notch signaling has been shown to mediate a wide array of cell fate decisions during development. While previous work has demonstrated that Notch signaling plays an important role in regulating cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis, an earlier role during cardiac field formation has not yet been fully characterized. Previously, our lab demonstrated that perturbations in Notch signaling beginning at the onset of gastrulation affect the subdivision of germ layers. However due to the potential additive effects of misregulating Notch signaling over multiple stages of development, it was not possible to distinguish a specific role for this pathway during heart field specification. Here, we developed an innovative approach that takes advantage of temporally inducible constructs to isolate our manipulations to specific windows of development. In particular, we focused our studies on some of the earliest stages of cardiogenesis when heart field specification occurs. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for Notch signaling during the prepatterning of the cardiac mesoderm. Specifically, once relieved of aberrantly activated Notch signaling following gastrulation, cardiac precursors retain the ability to express markers of the cardiac field. Conversely, downregulating Notch signaling in cells fated to become heart tissue results in the induction of cardiac field genes in gastrula embryos. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that this new role for Notch signaling is mediated at least in part via the Notch effector protein, Esr9 and the transcription factor GATA4. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for a novel role for Notch signaling in regulating the timing of heart field specification during early cardiogenesis.", "journal": "Developmental biology", "date": "2009-07-08", "authors": ["Carolyn MMiazga", "Kelly AMcLaughlin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.06.040"}

However, the relationships between tissue structure, wave conduction velocity, and safety at such junctions are unknown. We have developed a structurally and electrophysiologically detailed model of the canine Purkinje-ventricular junction (PVJ) and varied its heterogeneity parameters to determine such relationships. We show that neither very fast nor very slow conduction is safe, and there exists an optimal velocity that provides the maximum safety factor for conduction through the junction. The resultant conduction time delay across the PVJ is a natural consequence of the electrophysiological and morphological differences between the Purkinje fiber and ventricular tissue. The delay allows the PVJ to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to excite the adjacent ventricular tissue, but is not long enough for the source-to-load mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over time. The observed relationships between the conduction velocity and safety factor can provide new insights into optimal conditions for wave propagation through nonuniform junctions between various cardiac tissues.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2009-07-08", "authors": ["Oleg VAslanidi", "PhilipStewart", "Mark RBoyett", "HengguiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.061"}

In the present study, doxorubicin treatment in a dose of 3mg/kg, i.p., every other day for six doses showed a significant 2.6-, 3- and 10.5-fold increase in the cardiac enzyme activities CK-MB and LDH and troponin-I, respectively, in the serum of the animals.

Via a number of different methodologies it has previously been shown that reaction-diffusion systems are at multiple levels Turing complete. That is, they are capable of computation in the same manner as a universal Turing machine. However, all such computational systems are subject to a limitation known as the Halting problem.

{"title": "Fast Needle Insertion to Minimize Tissue Deformation and Damage.", "abstract": "During needle-based procedures, transitions between tissue layers often involve puncture events that produce substantial deformation and tend to drive the needle off course. In this paper, we analyze the mechanics of these rupture events corresponding to unstable crack propagation during the insertion of a sharp needle in an inhomogeneous tissue. The force-deflection curve of the needle prior to a rupture event is modeled by a nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin model and a stress analysis is used to predict the relationship between rupture force and needle velocity. The model predicts that the force-deflection response of the needle is steeper and the tissue absorbs less energy when the needle moves faster. The force of rupture also decreases for faster insertion under certain conditions. The observed properties are sufficient to show that maximizing needle velocity minimizes tissue deformation and damage, and consequently, results in less needle insertion position error. The model predicts that tissue deformation and absorbed energy asymptotically approach lower bounds as velocity increases.

Redox imbalance and/or changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression have been associated with diabetes-related cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms of these changes and their interrelationships remain unclear. Using a murine type 1 diabetes model, we tested the hypothesis that alterations in cardiac performance are associated with decreased cardiac microvascular prevalence, as well as downregulation of VEGF isoforms. We also investigated oxidative stress as a contributor to regulate individual VEGF isoforms and microvascular rarefaction. Significant and rapid hyperglycemia was observed at 1 wk post-streptozotocin (STZ) and persisted throughout the 5-wk study. Left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening was reduced at week 1 and 5 post-STZ insult relative to age-matched controls. We also observed the early reduction in E/A ratio at 1 wk. Immunostaining for CD31 and digital image analysis demonstrated a 35% reduction in microvessels/myocardial area, indicative of rarefaction, which was highly correlated with fractional shortening. Furthermore, a significant increase in the prevalence of protein 3-nitrotyrosine was observed in the diabetic cardiac tissue, which was inversely associated with microvascular rarefaction. The expressions of three VEGF isoforms were significantly reduced to different extents. The reduction of VEGF(164) was associated with GSSG accumulation. These data demonstrate that the mouse model of STZ-induced diabetes has hallmark features observed in humans with respect to nonischemic systolic and diastolic performance and microvascular rarefaction, which are associated with changes in VEGF isoform expression and redox imbalance in the myocardium.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Strategies for preventing PN injury in the pericardial space are limited.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare methods for separating the PN from the epicardial surface in order to prevent PN injury.\nEight patients referred for epicardial ablation of arrhythmias were enrolled in the study. All patients required ablation near the PN. Endocardial and epicardial access was obtained in all patients. A three-dimensional mapping system was used to guide mapping and ablation. All patients underwent epicardial catheter ablation. Pacing via the ablation catheter identified the location of the PN. In order to prevent PN injury, four new strategies were tested in each patient. We sought to increase the distance between the epicardium and the PN by (1) placing a large-diameter balloon between the nerve and the myocardium, (2) introducing saline in steps of 20 ml until PN capture was lost or blood pressure dropped below 60 mmHg, (3) introducing air until PN capture was lost or blood pressure dropped below 60 mmHg, or (4) introducing a combination of saline and air until PN capture was lost or blood pressure dropped below 60 mmHg.\nAt each step, epicardial pacing was performed to assess for PN stimulation. The combination of air and saline resulted in the greatest decrease of PN stimulation. Saline only failed in all cases.

After transplantation and before reperfusion of the donor heart, a 5-mm left (n = 6) or right (n = 9) ventriculotomy was performed and the patch was sutured onto the donor heart to repair the defect. Echocardiographical studies carried out 1-2 weeks after transplantation showed normal LV function in seven of the eight hearts studied. After 1 month, visual examination of the grafted patch revealed no aneurysmal dilatation. Microscopic examination revealed, in most of the cardiac patches, a complete disappearance of the scaffold and its replacement by a consistent tissue composed of myofibroblasts embedded in collagen bundles. The cardiac patch was enriched with a relatively large number of infiltrating blood vessels.

Dead cells are gradually replaced by a fibrotic scar, which disrupts the normal electromechanical continuum of the ventricular muscle and compromises its pumping capacity. Recent studies in animal models of ischemic cardiomyopathy suggest that transplantation of various stem cell preparations can improve heart recovery after injury. The first clinical trials in patients produced some encouraging results, showing modest benefits. Most of the positive effects are probably because of a favorable paracrine influence of stem cells on the disease microenvironment. Stem cell therapy attenuates inflammation, reduces apoptosis of surrounding cells, induces angiogenesis, and lessens the extent of fibrosis. However, little new heart tissue is formed. The current challenge is to find ways to improve the engraftment, long-term survival and appropriate differentiation of transplanted stem cells within the cardiovascular tissue. Hence, there has been a surge of interest in pluripotent stem cells with robust cardiogenic potential, as well as in the inherent repair and regenerative mechanisms of the heart.

Using a rat heart transplant model and 2 different rat strains (Dark Agouti, and Brown Norway), microarrays were performed on native hearts, transplanted hearts, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\nIn heart tissue, strain alone affected the expression of only 33 probesets while rejection affected the expression of 1368 probesets (FDR 10% and FC > o= 3). Only 13 genes were affected by both strain and rejection, which was < 1% (13/1368) of all probesets differentially expressed in ACR. However, for PBMC, strain alone affected 265 probesets (FDR 10% and FC > or = 3) and the addition of ACR had little further effect. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed strain effect genes connected them with immune response, cell motility and cell death, functional themes that overlap with those related to ACR. After accounting for animal strain, additional analysis identified 30 PBMC candidate genes potentially associated with ACR.\nIn ACR, genetic background has a large impact on the transcriptome of immune cells, but not heart tissue.

Both embryonic and adult SCs can be differentiated into a great variety of tissue cell types, including cardiac myocytes. In vivo studies and clinical trials, however, have demonstrated major limitations in reconstituting the myocardium in failing hearts. These limitations include precise control of SC proliferation, survival and phenotype both prior and subsequent to transplantation and avoidance of serious adverse effects such as tumorigenesis and arrhythmias. Micro- and nanoscale techniques to recreate SC niches, the natural environment for the maintenance and regulation of SCs, have enabled the elucidation of novel SC behaviors and offer great promise in the fabrication of cardiac tissue constructs. The ability to precisely manipulate the interface between biopolymeric scaffolds and SCs at in vivo scale resolutions is unique to micro- and nanoscale approaches and may help overcome limitations of conventional biological scaffolds and methods for cell delivery. We now know that micro- and nanoscale manipulation of scaffold composition, mechanical properties, and three-dimensional architecture have profound influences on SC fate and will likely prove important in developing the next generation of \"transplantable SC niches\" for regeneration of heart and other tissues. In this review, we examine two key aspects of micro- and nanofabricated SC-based cardiac tissue constructs: the role of scaffold composition and the role of scaffold architecture and detail how recent work in these areas brings us closer to clinical solutions for cardiovascular regeneration.", "journal": "Tissue engineering.

Cardiac TnI concentrations in serum increased in a dose-dependant manner and remained increased twenty-four to forty-eight hours after a single administration of isoproterenol. Increased cTnI concentration was of greater magnitude and longer duration than increased fatty acid binding protein 3 concentration, aspartate aminotransferase activity, and creatine kinase activity in serum. Isoproterenol-induced increases in cTnI concentrations were both greater and more sustained in BALB/c than in CD1 mice and correlated with incidence and severity of lesions observed in heart sections from both strains. In drug development studies in BALB/c mice with novel kinase inhibitors, cTnI concentration was a reliable stand-alone biomarker of cardiac injury and was used in combination with measurements of in vivo target inhibition to demonstrate an off-target contribution to cardiotoxicity. Additional attributes, including low cost and rapid turnaround time, made cTnI concentration in serum invaluable for detecting cardiotoxicity, exploring structure-activity relationships, and prioritizing development of compounds with improved safety profiles early in drug discovery.", "journal": "Toxicologic pathology", "date": "2009-06-25", "authors": ["Steven KEngle", "William HJordan", "Michael LPritt", "Alan YChiang", "Myrtle ADavis", "John LZimmermann", "Daniel GRudmann", "Kathleen MHeinz-Taheny", "Armando RIrizarry", "YumiYamamoto", "DavidMendel", "A EricSchultze", "Paul DCornwell", "David EWatson"], "doi": "10.1177/0192623309339502"}

{"title": "Murine \"cardiospheres\" are not a source of stem cells with cardiomyogenic potential.", "abstract": "Recent remarkable studies have reported that clonogenic putative cardiac stem cells (CSCs) with cardiomyogenic potential migrate from heart tissue biopsies during ex vivo culture, and that these CSCs self-organize into spontaneously beating cardiospheres (CSs). Such data have provided clear promise that injured heart tissue may be repaired by stem cell therapy using autologous CS-derived cells. By further examining CSs from the original CS protocol using immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and microscopic analysis, we here report a more mundane result: that spontaneously beating CSs from neonatal rats likely consist of contaminating myocardial tissue fragments. Thus, filtering away these tissue fragments resulted in CSs without cardiomyogenic potential. Similar data were obtained with CSs derived from neonatal mice as wells as adult rats/mice. Additionally, using in vitro culture, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that these CSs are generated by cellular aggregation of GATA-4(+)/collagen I(+)/alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+)/CD45(-) cells rather than by clonal cell growth. In contrast, we found that the previously proposed CS-forming cells, dubbed phase bright cells, were GATA-4(-)/collagen I(-)/alpha-SMA(-)/CD45(+) and unable to form CSs by themselves. Phenotypically, the CS cells largely resembled fibroblasts, and they lacked cardiomyogenic as well as endothelial differentiation potential. Our data imply that the murine CS model is unsuitable as a source of CSCs with cardiomyogenic potential, a result that is in contrast to previously published data. We therefore suggest, that human CSs should be further characterized with respect to phenotype and differentiation potential before initiating human trials.", "journal": "Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)", "date": "2009-06-23", "authors": ["Ditte CarolineAndersen", "PeterAndersen", "MikaelSchneider", "Hasse Br\u00f8nnumJensen", "S\u00f8ren PaludanSheikh"], "doi": "10.1002/stem.72"}
{"title": "Biodesign of a renal-protective peptide based on alternative splicing of B-type natriuretic peptide.", "abstract": "Alternative RNA splicing may provide unique opportunities to identify drug targets and therapeutics. We identified an alternative spliced transcript for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) resulting from intronic retention. This transcript is present in failing human hearts and is reduced following mechanical unloading. The intron-retained transcript would generate a unique 34 amino acid (aa) carboxyl terminus while maintaining the remaining structure of native BNP. We generated antisera to this carboxyl terminus and identified immunoreactivity in failing human heart tissue. The alternatively spliced peptide (ASBNP) was synthesized and unlike BNP, failed to stimulate cGMP in vascular cells or vasorelax preconstricted arterial rings. This suggests that ASBNP may lack the dose-limiting effects of recombinant BNP. Given structural considerations, a carboxyl-terminal truncated form of ASBNP was generated (ASBNP.1) and was determined to retain the ability of BNP to stimulate cGMP in canine glomerular isolates and cultured human mesangial cells but lacked similar effects in vascular cells. In a canine-pacing model of heart failure, systemic infusion of ASBNP.1 did not alter mean arterial pressure but increased the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), suppressed plasma renin and angiotensin, while inducing natriuresis and diuresis. Consistent with its distinct in vivo effects, the activity of ASBNP.1 may not be explained through binding and activation of NPR-A or NPR-B. Thus, the biodesigner peptide ASBNP.1 enhances GFR associated with heart failure while lacking the vasoactive properties of BNP.

Before resuscitation, rats received either vehicle, 17beta-estradiol (1 mg/kg), or 17beta-estradiol plus the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (1 mg/kg). At 2 hrs after trauma-hemorrhage or sham operation, the rats were killed.\nCardiac function, heart tissue myeloperoxidase activity, cardiac and circulatory cytokine levels, cardiac intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and chemokine levels were measured. Cardiac Akt and heme oxygenase-1 were also determined. We found that 17beta-estradiol prevented the trauma-hemorrhage-induced impairment in cardiac function and increase in cardiac myeloperoxidase activity. Cardiac and systemic interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels as well as cardiac intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 contents were increased following trauma-hemorrhage, which were normalized by 17beta-estradiol. Administration of 17beta-estradiol following trauma-hemorrhage restored cardiac Akt phosphorylation and further increased heme oxygenase-1 expression. Coadministration of wortmannin following trauma-hemorrhage abolished the previous effects by 17beta-estradiol.\nThese results suggest that the 17beta-estradiol-meditated improvement in cardiac function following trauma-hemorrhage occurs via Akt-dependent heme oxygenase-1 up-regulation.", "journal": "Critical care medicine", "date": "2009-06-18", "authors": ["Jun-TeHsu", "Wen-HongKan", "Chi-HsunHsieh", "Mashkoor AChoudhry", "Kirby IBland", "Irshad HChaudry"], "doi": "10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181a030ce"}

Physiological activity of NAEs is known to depend on the level of unsaturation. Therefore, here we investigated the effects of saturated N-stearylethanolamine (NSE) and monounsaturated N-oleylethanolamine on electric excitability of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. 1 microM of either NSE or OEA decreased the duration of cardiac action potential (AP) from all parts of heart muscle. Shortening of AP was partially reversible, though the reversibility of AP duration upon washout of substances was more complete for endocardial ventricular compared to epicardial and atrial cardiomyocytes. I microM NSE depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) of epicardial and of 65% of endocardial cells, whilst other cells types showed weakly reversible hyperpolarization. 1 microM OEA caused reversible RMP hyperpolarization of all studied cell types. NSE and OEA decreased the amplitude and upstroke velocity of AP that suggests their effect on sodium channels. NSE and to a lesser extent OEA inhibited the amplitude of AP phase 2 (plateau) which may indicate an inhibition of high-voltage-activated calcium channels. Effects of NSE and OEA on RMP and repolarization phase of AP (phase 3) depended on cardiac cell type suggesting differential regulation of inward rectifier Kir and voltage-gated delayed rectifier potassium channels by these lipids. We cannot also exclude interaction of NSE and OEA with anion channels, backgound K+ channels and ion transporters of the cardiomyocytes' plasma membrane. Overall, NSE-induced changes of AP parameters were less reversible than those induced by OEA, suggesting a slower degradation/ convertion of NSE in plasma membrane compared to OEA.", "journal": "Fiziolohichnyi zhurnal (Kiev, Ukraine : 1994)", "date": "2009-06-17", "authors": ["O IVo\u012dtychuk", "V SAsmolkova", "N MHula", "H VSotkis", "MOz", "Ia MShuba"], "doi": null}

In this work, we measured changes in sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) and phospholamban (PLB) in hearts of hypo- and hyperthyroid rabbits and compared them with modifications induced by short- and long-term cold exposure. Short-term cold exposure promotes a small increase in T3 and, similar to hyperthyroidism, induces an increase of heart SERCA2a expression. The total PLB content does not change in hyperthyroidism, but short-term cold exposure promotes a significant decrease in total PLB and an increase in the ratio between phosphorylated and total PLB. The temperature of a given tissue depends on the balance between the heat provided by blood circulation and the rate of heat production by the tissue. In an attempt to evaluate the heat contribution of cardiac tissue, we measured mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized cardiac muscle and heat produced by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during Ca(2+) transport. We observed that there was an increase in oxygen consumption and heat production during Ca(2+) transport by cardiac SR in both hyperthyroidism and short-term cold exposure. In contrast, both the mitochondrial respiration rate and heat derived from Ca(2+) transport were decreased in hypothyroid rabbits. The heart changes in oxygen consumption, SERCA2a-PLB ratio, and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity detected during short-term cold exposure were abolished after cold adaptation.

We quantified the fatty acid profiles of polar and neutral lipid fractions of several tissues in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and compared these profiles among birds fed either a control diet of only hulled millet, or one of two experimental diets of hulled millet supplemented with either 8% (by mass) sunflower seed oil (omega6-enriched diet) or linseed oil (omega3-enriched diet). We found that different lipid fractions vary widely in their diversity and complexity of FA composition, with neutral lipids being much less structurally diverse than those of polar lipids, for example, and that the fatty acid compositions of different organs exhibited different propensities to be altered by the diet, with brain and cardiac tissues having lower levels of flexibility than skeletal muscle and liver. We also present evidence suggesting that adipose tissue may be used to sequester essential FAs when they occur in the diet at levels that exceed immediate requirements. We conclude that the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue may not be a particularly useful indicator of the dietary FA composition of birds, and suggest that future studies investigating the relationships between the FA profiles of bird tissues and bird diets and/or physiological performance variables examine multiple tissues and distinguish between neutral and polar lipid fractions.", "journal": "Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Both metals induced IL-6 release in a concentration (20-200 microM)-dependent manner. Zn2+ appeared more potent than Cu2+ in both mono- and cocultures of CMs and CFs. In the cocultures, the basal- and metal-induced IL-6 responses were synergistically increased compared to the monocultures. Exposure to Zn2+ increased phosphorylation of the MAP-kinases, ERK1/2 and p38, in monocultures of CMs and CFs. Cu2+ induced an increased phosphorylation of p38 in both cell types and of ERK1/2 in CFs, but at higher concentrations than Zn2+. Treatment with a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) reduced the IL-6 responses to Zn2+ and Cu2+ in both cell types.

We determined the positional fates of precardiac cells using a precision electroporation approach in combination with wide-field time-lapse microscopy in the quail embryo, a warm-blooded vertebrate (HH Stages 4 through 10). Contrary to previous studies, the results demonstrate the existence of a \"continuous\" circle-shaped heart field that spans the midline, appearing at HH Stage 4, which then expands to form a wide arc of progenitors at HH Stages 5-7. Our time-resolved image data show that a subset of these cardiac progenitor cells do not overlap with the expression of common cardiogenic factors, Nkx-2.5 and Bmp-2, until HH Stage 10, when a tubular heart has formed, calling into question when cardiac fate is specified and by which key factors. Sub-groups and anatomical bands (cohorts) of heart precursor cells dramatically change their relative positions in a process largely driven by endodermal folding and other large-scale tissue deformations. Thus, our novel dynamic positional fate maps resolve the origin of cardiac progenitor cells in amniotes. The data also establish the concept that tissue motion contributes significantly to cellular position fate - i.e., much of the cellular displacement that occurs during assembly of a midline heart tube (HH Stage 9) is NOT due to \"migration\" (autonomous motility), a commonly held belief.

Gap junction expression and function were assessed by immunostaining, immunoblotting, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and were correlated with the optically mapped propagation of action potentials. We found that neonatal rat ventricular fibroblasts negative for the myofibroblast marker smooth muscle alpha-actin expressed connexin-45 rather than connexin-43 or connexin-40, weakly coupled to cardiomyocytes, and, without significant depolarization of cardiac resting potential, slowed cardiac conduction to 75% of control only at high (>60%) coverage densities, similar to loading effects found from HEK-293 cells expressing similar levels of connexin-45. In contrast, HEK-293 cells with connexin-43 expression similar to that of cardiomyocytes significantly decreased cardiac conduction velocity and maximum capture rate to as low as 22% and 25% of control values, respectively, while increasing cardiac action potential duration to 212% of control and cardiac resting potential from -71.6 +/- 4.9 mV in controls to -65.0 +/- 3.8 mV. For all unexcitable cell types and coverage densities, velocity anisotropy ratio remained unchanged.

We investigated whether mild and severe renal failure shorten cardiac telomeres and excessively shorten telomeres after MI.\nRats were subjected to sham, unilateral (UNX) or 5/6th nephrectomy (5/6NX) to induce none, mild or severe renal failure. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation. Renal function parameters and blood pressure were measured. DNA was isolated from non-infarcted cardiac tissue. Telomere length was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nProteinuria was unchanged in UNX and MI compared with control, but strongly increased in 5/6NX, UNX+MI and 5/6NX+MI. Serum creatinine levels were increased fourfold in 5/6NX and tenfold in 5/6NX+MI. 5/6NX and groups with both renal failure and MI showed an approximate 20% reduction of telomere length, similar to the MI group. No excess telomere shortening was observed in hearts from rats with renal ablation after MI.\nSevere renal failure, but not mild renal failure, leads to shortening of cardiac telomeres to a similar extent as found after MI.

{"title": "Cardiac alternans induced by fibroblast-myocyte coupling: mechanistic insights from computational models.", "abstract": "Recent experimental studies have shown that fibroblasts can electrotonically couple to myocytes via gap junctions. In this study, we investigated how this coupling affects action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) cycling dynamics in simulated fibroblast-myocyte pairs and in two-dimensional tissue with random fibroblast insertions. We show that a fibroblast coupled with a myocyte generates a gap junction current flowing to the myocyte with two main components: an early pulse of transient outward current, similar to the fast transient outward current, and a later background current during the repolarizing phase. Depending on the relative prominence of the two components, fibroblast-myoycte coupling can 1) prolong or shorten action potential duration (APD), 2) promote or suppress APD alternans due to steep APD restitution (voltage driven) and also result in a novel mechanism of APD alternans at slow heart rates, 3) promote Ca(i)-driven alternans and electromechanically discordant alternans, and 4) promote spatially discordant alternans by two mechanisms: by altering conduction velocity restitution and by heterogeneous fibroblast distribution causing electromechanically concordant and discordant alternans in different regions of the tissue. Thus, through their coupling with myocytes, fibroblasts alter repolarization and Ca(i) cycling alternans at both the cellular and tissue scales, which may play important roles in arrhythmogenesis in diseased cardiac tissue with fibrosis.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Influence of acid functionalization on the cardiopulmonary toxicity of carbon nanotubes and carbon black particles in mice.", "abstract": "Engineered carbon nanotubes are being developed for a wide range of industrial and medical applications. Because of their unique properties, nanotubes can impose potentially toxic effects, particularly if they have been modified to express functionally reactive chemical groups on their surface. The present study was designed to evaluate whether acid functionalization (AF) enhanced the cardiopulmonary toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) as well as control carbon black particles. Mice were exposed by oropharyngeal aspiration to 10 or 40 microg of saline-suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), acid-functionalized SWCNTs (AF-SWCNTs), ultrafine carbon black (UFCB), AF-UFCB, or 2 microg LPS. 24 hours later, pulmonary inflammatory responses and cardiac effects were assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage and isolated cardiac perfusion respectively, and compared to saline or LPS-instilled animals. Additional mice were assessed for histological changes in lung and heart. Instillation of 40 microg of AF-SWCNTs, UFCB and AF-UFCB increased percentage of pulmonary neutrophils. No significant effects were observed at the lower particle concentration. Sporadic clumps of particles from each treatment group were observed in the small airways and interstitial areas of the lungs according to particle dose. Patches of cellular infiltration and edema in both the small airways and in the interstitium were also observed in the high dose group. Isolated perfused hearts from mice exposed to 40 microg of AF-SWCNTs had significantly lower cardiac functional recovery, greater infarct size, and higher coronary flow rate than other particle-exposed animals and controls, and also exhibited signs of focal cardiac myofiber degeneration. No particles were detected in heart tissue under light microscopy. This study indicates that while acid functionalization increases the pulmonary toxicity of both UFCB and SWCNTs, this treatment caused cardiac effects only with the AF-carbon nanotubes.

Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and imbalance in nitric oxide (NO) production have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Hesperidin is a citrus bioflavonoid that possesses a potent antioxidant and NO modulating activities.\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of hesperidin against doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity.\nFour groups of animals were used in this study. First group served as a control and injected with the vehicle. Second group was given 200 mg/kg of hesperidin orally for seven consecutive days. The third group was injected with a single dose (20 mg/kg) of doxorubicin intraperitoneally and was sacrificed after 48 h. The fourth group was treated with hesperidin for seven days but on day five, 1-hour after hesperidin treatment, rats were injected with the single dose of doxorubicin. On day seven, the rats were scarified by decapitation. Blood was collected and processed for determination of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and NO. The hearts were removed and processed for both histopathological examination and determination of oxidative stress parameters like reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxide (TBARS) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.\nOur results showed that doxorubicin produced severe cardiotoxicity as indicated from increase in serum LDH, CK activities and NO level. Histopathological examination of DOX-treated rats revealed degenerative changes in heart tissues. The significant decrease in GSH levels, SOD activity and increase in TBARS levels, indicated that DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was mediated through ROS generation. On the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters.\nHesperidin may have a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.", "journal": "Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute", "date": "2009-06-01", "authors": ["Ihab TAbdel-Raheem", "Ahmed AAbdel-Ghany"], "doi": null}

Functional analysis of temperature-sensitive mutants of hspd1 and mps1 revealed that both are necessary for M\u00fcller glia-based cone photoreceptor regeneration in adult zebrafish retina. In the amputated fin, hspd1 is required for the induction of mesenchymal stem cells and blastema formation, whereas mps1 is required at a later step for rapid cell proliferation and outgrowth.

{"title": "Modeling of cardiac ischemia in human myocytes and tissue including spatiotemporal electrophysiological variations.", "abstract": "Cardiac tissue exhibits spatially heterogeneous electrophysiological properties. In cardiac diseases, these properties also change in time. This study introduces a framework to investigate their role in cardiac ischemia using mathematical modeling and computational simulations at cellular and tissue level. Ischemia was incorporated by reproducing effects of hyperkalemia, acidosis, and hypoxia with a human electrophysiological model. In tissue, spatial heterogeneous ischemia was described by central ischemic (CIZ) and border zone. Anisotropic conduction was simulated with a bidomain approach in an anatomical ventricle model including realistic fiber orientation and transmural, apico-basal, and interventricular electrophysiological heterogeneities. A model of electrical conductivity in a human torso served for ECG calculations. Ischemia increased resting but reduced peak voltage, action potential duration, and upstroke velocity. These effects were strongest in subepicardial cells. In tissue, conduction velocity decreased towards CIZ but effective refractory period increased. At 10 min of ischemia 19% of subepi- and 100% of subendocardial CIZ cells activated with a delay of 34.6+/-7.8 ms and 55.9+/-18.8 ms, respectively, compared to normal. Significant ST elevation and premature T wave end appeared only with the subepicardial CIZ. The model reproduced effects of ischemia at cellular and tissue level.

{"title": "Myofibroblasts in diseased hearts: new players in cardiac arrhythmias?", "abstract": "Cardiac pathologies leading to the development of organ fibrosis typically are associated with the appearance of interstitial myofibroblasts. This cell type plays a central role in excessive extracellular matrix deposition, thereby contributing to arrhythmogenic slow and discontinuous conduction by causing disorganization of the three-dimensional network of electrically coupled cardiomyocytes. Besides this involvement in structural remodeling, myofibroblasts recently have been discovered in-vitro to promote arrhythmogenesis by direct modification of cardiomyocyte electrophysiology following establishment of heterocellular electrical coupling. In particular, myofibroblasts were found to rescue impulse conduction between disjoined cardiac tissues by acting as passive electrical conduits for excitatory current flow. Although, in principle, such recovery of blocked conduction might be beneficial, propagation across myofibroblast conduits is substantially delayed, thereby promoting arrhythmogenic slow and discontinuous conduction. Second, moderately polarized myofibroblasts were found to induce cell density-dependent depolarization of cardiomyocytes, which causes arrhythmogenic slow conduction due to the reduction of fast inward currents. Finally, critical depolarization of cardiomyocytes by myofibroblasts was discovered to lead to the appearance of ectopic activity in a model of the infarct border zone. These findings obtained in vitro suggest that electrotonic interactions following gap junctional coupling between myofibroblasts and cardiomyocytes in structurally remodeled fibrotic hearts might directly initiate the main mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis, that is, abnormal automaticity and abnormal impulse conduction. If, in the future, similar arrhythmogenic mechanisms can be shown to be operational in intact hearts, myofibroblasts might emerge as a novel noncardiomyocyte target for antiarrhythmic therapy.", "journal": "Heart rhythm", "date": "2009-05-27", "authors": ["StephanRohr"], "doi": "10.1016/j.hrthm.2009.02.038"}

We studied the effects of chronic prenatal hypoxia on cardiac beta-AR signaling and the incidence of alterations in the juvenile beta-AR system due to the embryonic treatment. We measured functional beta-AR density (B(max)) through binding with [(3)H]CGP-12177 and the effect of agonists on beta-AR-dependent contractility (pEC(50)) through concentration-response curves to epinephrine. Eggs from broiler chickens were incubated in normoxia (N, 21% O(2)) or chronic hypoxia (H, 14% O(2)). Cardiac tissue from embryos and juveniles was used (15 and 19 day of embryonic development and 14 and 35 days posthatching, E19, E15, P14, and P35, respectively). Relative cardiac enlargement was found in the hypoxic groups at E15, E19, and P14, but not P35. B(max) significantly decreased in E19H. B(max) more than doubled posthatching but decreased from P14 to P35. The sensitivity to epinephrine was lower in E19N compared with E15N, but hypoxia increased the sensitivity to agonist in both E15H and E19H. Despite maintained receptor density, the P35H juvenile displayed a decreased sensitivity to beta-AR agonist, something that was not seen in P14H.

As the accuracy of the numerical solution cannot be compromised, efficiency of the solution technique is important to ensure that the results of the simulation can be obtained in a reasonable time while still encapsulating the complexities of the system. In an attempt to increase efficiency of the solver, the bidomain equations are often decoupled into one parabolic equation that is computationally very cheap to solve and an elliptic equation that is much more expensive to solve. In this study, the performance of this uncoupled solution method is compared with an alternative strategy in which the bidomain equations are solved as a coupled system. This seems counterintuitive as the alternative method requires the solution of a much larger linear system at each time step.

The lack of success and significant side effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs have given rise to attempts aimed to develop alternative novel pharmacologic treatments. On this line, the biological properties of the antioxidant vitamins C and E suggest that they could decrease the vulnerability of the heart to the oxidative damage.

The N588K mutation altered the I(hERG) profile during each AP type; increased maximal repolarising current occurred earlier during AP repolarisation (with shifts of +60 mV, +30 mV and +15 mV respectively for ventricular, Purkinje fibre and atrial APs). Thus SQT1 may influence repolarising I(hERG) for each cell type, with AP clamp experiments and simulation data indicating the greatest effect during ventricular APs. Changes in the timing of outward I(hERG) transients elicited by premature stimuli following AP commands indicate that SQT1 may alter the protection that hERG provides cardiac tissue against premature arrhythmogenic stimuli.", "journal": "Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society", "date": "2009-05-15", "authors": ["M JMcPate", "HZhang", "IAdeniran", "J MCordeiro", "H JWitchel", "J CHancox"], "doi": null}

Eggs with low, medium, and high levels of n-3 FA were obtained by feeding Cobb breeder hens were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet containing 3.5% sunflower oil (low n-3), 1.75% sunflower oil plus 1.75% fish oil (medium n-3), or 3.5% fish oil (high n-3). Total n-3 FA in the yolk ranged from 1.8, 10.3, and 13.3% for low, medium, and high n-3 eggs, respectively (P < 0.001). Total long-chain (>20 C) n-6 FA in the egg yolk were 7.4, 2.1, and 1.3 for low n-3, medium n-3, and high n-3 eggs, respectively (P < 0.001). No differences were observed in total fat content of the eggs, which was 33.3, 31.6, and 31.9% for low n-3, medium n-3, and high n-3 eggs, respectively (P > 0.05). Hatchability for the low, medium, and high n-3 eggs was 89, 85, and 83%, respectively (P > 0.05). The total lipid content of chick liver, heart, brain, and lungs can be placed in the following descending order: liver > brain > heart > lung and was not affected by egg FA (P > 0.05). Total n-3 FA were higher in the tissues of medium and high n-3 chicks than in the tissue of low n-3 chicks (P < 0.05). There was no effect of egg FA on docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) in the heart of low, medium, and high n-3 chicks (P > 0.05). There were no differences in total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, or superoxide dismutase activities in the tissues of chicks from low n-3, medium n-3, and high n-3 eggs (P > 0.05). The medium n-3 and high n-3 chicks had lower catalase activity in the heart than did the low n-3 chicks (P = 0.013). The TBA reactive substances were significantly lower in the liver of high n-3 chicks than in that of low and medium n-3 chicks (P < 0.05). Heart tissue prostaglandin E(2) concentration was higher in low n-3 chicks than in those hatched from medium or high n-3 eggs (P < 0.05).

The G proteins, G(s) (stimulatory) and G(i) (inhibitory), are involved in calcium regulation; overexpression has pathological consequences. The aims of this study were to examine the differential expression of G(s) G protein and G(i) in the hearts of hyperhomocysteinemic (Hhcy) mice, and to determine if homocysteine (Hcy) acts as an agonist in cell culture to mediate the change in G protein isoforms. To create Hhcy, heterozygous cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) knockout (KO) mice were used. Mice were sacrificed, hearts were excised, cardiac tissue homogenates were prepared, and Western blots were performed. The results suggested that G(s) G protein was downregulated in cardiac tissue of heterozygous CBS KO mice to 46% that of control hearts. However, the intracellular G(i) G protein content remained the same in heterozygous CBS KO mice. Transformed cardiomyocyte HL-1 cells were treated with varying concentrations of homocysteine. The results suggested no detectable differential G(s) and G(i) expression.

Hearts from obese diabetic and lean littermate control rats were perfused with VLDL and CM from diabetic and control rats. Metabolic fate of the lipoprotein TAG and contractile function were examined. Myocardial utilisation of both VLDL- and CM-TAG was increased in the diabetic state. Diabetic hearts oxidised diabetic lipoprotein-TAG to a greater extent than control lipoproteins; glucose oxidation was decreased. There was no difference in lipoprotein-TAG assimilation into diabetic heart lipids; diabetic lipoproteins were, however, a poor substrate for control heart tissue lipid accumulation. Although the proportion of exogenous lipid incorporated into tissue TAG was increased in diabetic hearts perfused with control lipoproteins, this effect was not seen in diabetic hearts perfused with diabetic lipoproteins. Myocardial heparin-releasable lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was moderately increased in the diabetic state, and diabetic lipoproteins increased tissue-residual LPL activity. Cardiac hydraulic work was decreased only in diabetic hearts perfused with diabetic CM. Compositional analysis of diabetic variant lipoproteins indicated changes in size and apoprotein content. Alterations in cardiac TAG-rich lipoprotein metabolism in type 2 diabetes are due to changes in both the diabetic myocardium and the diabetic lipoprotein particle; decreased contractile function is not related to cardiac lipid accumulation from TAG-rich lipoproteins but may be associated with changes in TAG-fatty acid oxidation.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2009-05-13", "authors": ["You-GuoNiu", "Rhys DEvans"], "doi": "10.1113/jphysiol.2009.173542"}

These transient effects may depend on the transplanted cell-type or its differentiation state. We have identified a population of cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) capable of differentiating efficiently into beating cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in vitro. We investigated whether CMPCs or pre-differentiated CMPC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMPC-CM) are able to restore the injured myocardium after MI in mice.\nMI was induced in immunodeficient mice and was followed by intra-myocardial injection of CMPCs, CMPC-CM, or vehicle. Cardiac function was measured longitudinally up to 3 months post-MI using 9.4 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. The fate of the human cells was determined by immunohistochemistry. Transplantation of CMPCs or CMPC-CM resulted in a higher ejection fraction and reduced the extent of left ventricular remodelling up to 3 months after MI when compared with vehicle-injected animals. CMPCs and CMPC-CM generated new cardiac tissue consisting of human cardiomyocytes and blood vessels. Fusion of human nuclei with murine nuclei was not observed.\nCMPCs differentiated into the same cell types in situ as can be obtained in vitro. This excludes the need for in vitro pre-differentiation, making CMPCs a promising source for (autologous) cell-based therapy.", "journal": "Cardiovascular research", "date": "2009-05-12", "authors": ["Anke MSmits", "Linda Wvan Laake", "Kristaden Ouden", "ChantalSchreurs", "K\u00e1rolySzuhai", "Cees Jvan Echteld", "Christine LMummery", "Pieter ADoevendans", "Marie-Jos\u00e9Goumans"], "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvp146"}

We propose here that the use of long-acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, tadalafil, may confer sustained cardioprotection against ischemia. Tadalafil (5 mg/kg) was administered orally to male C57B/6J mice (n = 6 in each treatment subgroup at each time point studied). Hearts were isolated and subjected to 40 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion on Langendorff's apparatus at 1, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 108 h after tadalafil administration. In 1- to 48-h subgroups, tadalafil was given once at 0 h only. In 60- and 72-h subgroups, tadalafil was given twice at 0 and 36 h. Similarly, in the 108-h subgroup, tadalafil was administered at 0, 36, and 72 h. In the same subgroups, wortmannin (15 microg/kg ip), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5 mg/kg ip), an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, was given together with tadalafil, and the hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion at 36 h to determine whether the effect of tadalafil on ischemia-reperfusion injury was abolished. As a result, tadalafil treatment reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased left ventricular developed pressure as well as reduced lactate dehydrogenase release. This protection remained till 36-40 h, and thereafter it vanished. The readministration of tadalafil at 36 and 72 h restored the protection till 108 h. Tadalafil treatment accelerated Akt phosphorylation in cardiac tissue and decreased myocyte apoptosis. The administration of wortmannin abolished the beneficial effects of tadalafil on hemodynamic parameters and myocyte apoptosis, together with significantly reduced Akt phosphorylation. 5-Hydroxydecanoic acid also abolished the antiapoptotic effect of tadalafil. It is concluded that tadalafil treatment induces the long-term protection of ischemic myocardium via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

OPN and the cytokine interleukin (IL)-18 have been shown to be overexpressed in an array of human cardiac pathologies. In the present study, we determined the role of IL-18 in the regulation of cardiac OPN expression and the subsequent interstitial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. We demonstrated parallel increases in IL-18, OPN expression, and interstitial fibrosis in murine models of left ventricular pressure and volume overload. Exogenous recombinant (r)IL-18 administered for 2 wk increased cardiac OPN expression, interstitial fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Stimulation of the T helper (Th)1 lymphocyte phenotype with a selective toll-like receptor (TLR)9 agonist induced cardiac IL-18 and OPN expression, which was associated with increased cardiac fibrillar collagen concentrations and interstitial fibrosis resulting in diastolic dysfunction. rIL-18 induced OPN expression and protein levels in primary of cardiac fibroblast cultures. Conditioned media from TLR9-stimulated T lymphocyte cultures induced IL-18 and OPN expression in cardiac fibroblasts, while blockade of the IL-18 receptor with a neutralizing antibody abolished the increase in OPN expression. Furthermore, a mutation in the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)1 or IRF1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the decreased expression of IL-18 and OPN in cardiac fibroblasts. With pressure overload, IRF1-mutant mice showed downregulation of IL-18 and OPN expression in cardiac tissue, reduced cardiac fibrotic development, and increased left ventricular function compared with wild type.

Wild-type C57BL/6, 129Sv mice treated or not with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, 5-LO inhibitor), mice lacking the 5-LO enzyme gene (5-LO(-/-)) and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS(-/-)) were infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Impairment of 5-LO resulted in increased numbers of trypomastigote forms in the blood and amastigote forms in the heart of infected mice. We assessed oxidative stress in erythrocytes by measuring oxygen uptake, induction time and chemiluminescence following treatment with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH). Our results show that 5-LO metabolites increased lipid peroxidation levels in erythrocytes during the early phase of murine T. cruzi infection. NDGA treatment reduced oxidative damage of erythrocytes in C57BL/6 T. cruzi-infected mice but not in C57BL/6 iNOS(-/-) infected mice, showing that the action of NDGA is dependent on endogenous nitric oxide (NO). In addition, our results show that 5-LO metabolites do not participate directly in the development of anemia in infected mice.

{"title": "Milk-borne relaxin and the lactocrine hypothesis for maternal programming of neonatal tissues.", "abstract": "The fact that all newborn mammals drink milk extends the time frame of maternal influence on development into neonatal life. While the nutritional and immunological benefits of milk are clear, the role of milk as a conduit for bioactive factors with the potential to affect neonatal development is less well defined. Porcine and canine milk contain immunoreactive relaxin (RLX) that is transmitted into the circulation of nursing offspring. In the pig, a window of opportunity for transmission of milk-borne RLX is open at birth and remains so for about the first 3 days of neonatal life. Recent studies have shown that pro RLX is the major form of RLX in milk and that milk-borne porcine pro RLX is biologically active. Moreover, RLX receptor (RXFP1) expression is detectable in the porcine female reproductive tract and other somatic tissues at birth. The lactocrine hypothesis for maternal programming of neonatal development was proposed as a mechanism whereby RLX, a prototypical milk-borne growth factor in the pig, is delivered to nursing offspring, where it can affect development of RXFP1-positive target tissues. Data indicating that treatment of newborn gilts with RLX increased estrogen receptor-alpha expression in the uterus and cervix by postnatal day 2 support a role for RLX in lactocrine programming of the female reproductive tract.

Additive beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease have been reported for amlodipine and atorvastatin. However, it is still unclear whether the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin has additive beneficial effects on the regression of advanced cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. In the present study, the effects of the drug combination on advanced cardiac hypertrophy were investigated in elderly spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Elderly SHR (36 weeks old) were randomly allocated into four groups of 12: (i) a vehicle-treated control group; (ii) an amlodipine (10 mg/kg per day)-treated group; (iii) an atorvastatin (10 mg/kg per day)-treated group; and (iv) a group treated with a combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin (both at 10 mg/kg per day). Drugs were administered by oral gavage every morning for a period of 12 weeks before hearts were harvested for analysis. 3. Combined administration of amlodipine and atorvastatin significantly suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and upregulation of hypertrophic and profibrotic genes, and also improved left ventricular diastolic dysfunction to a greater extent than did amlodipine monotherapy. Further beneficial effects of combination therapy on advanced cardiac hypertrophy were associated with a greater reduction of NADPH oxidase-mediated increases in cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS), rather than decreased blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. 4. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined cardiovascular NADPH oxidase subunits and found that amlodipine clearly attenuated the expression of p47(phox) and p40(phox) and slightly but significantly reduced p22(phox) and Rac-1 levels in heart tissue. Combination treatment with amlodipine plus atorvastatin led to a further reduction in p22(phox), p47(phox) and Rac-1 protein levels compared with amlodipine alone. 5. In conclusion, combined amlodipine and atorvastatin treatment has a greater beneficial effect on advanced cardiac hypertrophy compared with amlodipine monotherapy.

{"title": "New design for an endoesophageal sector- based array for the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a parametric simulation study.", "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent and sustained cardiac arrhythmia affecting humans. The electrical isolation by ablation of the pulmonary veins (PV) in the left atrium (LA) of the heart has proved to be an effective cure for the AF. The ablation consists mainly of the formation of a localized circumferential thermal coagulation of the cardiac tissue surrounding the PVs. In this article, a parametric study was carried out to establish an optimal configuration of endesophageal ultrasound phased arrays intended to treat the AF. The devices are spherical-surface sections truncated at 15 mm, with a depth of 4 mm, and they are cut in concentric-rings, each composed of independently driven sectors. The number of independent elements (N(e)) was minimized for different values of ratio of pressure amplitude of the secondary lobe over the main lobe (eta) of 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, and 0.5 inside a volume of interest (VOI). After assuming a Cartesian system with the origin in the center of the device, the VOI was defined as the prism enclosed by the coordinates (-12, 10, -9) mm and (12, 37, 9) mm. The VOI has its center at (0, 23.5, 0) mm and is large enough to contain all the targets identified in the Visible Human Project Male specimen. Operating at 1 MHz, eta and N(e)were calculated in function of the element size and focal length (F). Four devices for each value of eta were found. After keeping values of F and normalized dimensions of the independent elements in terms of wavelength, higher frequencies were considered: 1.25 MHz, 1.5 MHz, and 2 MHz. In total, 16 device configurations were obtained. Realistic modeling of lesion formation in the heart chamber showed that the 16 configurations were able to produce the typical lesion used to treat the AF while preserving surrounding structures.

{"title": "The cardiomyogenic differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells on silk fibroin-polysaccharide cardiac patches in vitro.", "abstract": "Polysaccharides and proteins profoundly impact the development and growth of tissues in the natural extra-cellular matrix (ECM). To mimic a natural ECM, polysaccharides were incorporated to/or co-sprayed with silk fibroin (SF) to produce SF/chitosan (CS) or SF/CS-hyaluronic acid (SF/CS-HA) microparticles that were further processed by mechanical pressing and genipin cross-linking to produce hybrid cardiac patches. The ATR-FTIR spectra confirm the co-existence of CS or CS-HA and SF in microparticles and patches. For evaluating the cellular responses of rMSCs to the SF/CS and SF/CS-HA cardiac patches, the growth of rMSCs and cardiomyogenic differentiation of 5-aza inducing rMSCs cultured on patches was examined. First, the isolated rMSCs were identified with various positive and negative surface markers such as CD 44 and CD 31 by a flow cytometric technique, respectively. For examining the growth of rMSCs on the patches, MTT viability assay was performed, and the results demonstrated that the growth of rMSCs on SF and SF-hybrid patches significantly exceeded (P<0.001) that on culture wells after seven days of cultivation. Additionally, the relative growth rates of rMSCs on SF/CS and SF/CS-HA hybrid patches were significantly better (P<0.01) than that on SF patches that were also observed by using vimentin stain to the cells. For instance, the relative cell growth rates (%) in cell culture wells, SF, SF/CS and SF/CS-HA patches were 100%, 282.9+/-6.5%, 337.0+/-8.0% and 332.6+/-6.6% (n=6, for all), respectively. For investigating the effects of the hybrid patches on cardiomyogenic differentiation of 5-aza inducing rMSCs, the expressions of specific cardiac genes of cells such as Gata4 and Nkx2.5 were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) analysis. The results of cardiomyogenic differentiation of induced rMSCs on SF/CS and SF/CS-HA hybrid patches significantly improved the expressions of cardiac genes of Gata4, Nkx2.5, Tnnt2 and Actc1 genes (all, P<0.01 or better, n=3) than those on SF patches and culture wells. Interestingly, the results of cardiac gene expressions of the cells on the SF/CS-HA hybrid patches were the most pronounced in promoting cardiomyogenic differentiations in this investigation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of cardiac proteins such as cardiotin and connexin 43 for induced rMSCs cultured on SF/CS and SF/CS-HA hybrid patches were much pronounced compared with SF patches, indicating the improvements of cardiomyogenic differentiation on the hybrid patches.

Recent reports indicate that interactions between the CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) critically mediate the ischemia-induced recruitment of bone marrow-derived circulating stem/progenitor cells, but the expression of CXCR4 in cardiac progenitor cells is very low. Here, we studied the influence of hypoxia on CXCR4 expression in cardiac progenitor cells, on the recruitment of intravenously administered cells to ischemic heart tissue, and on the preservation of heart function in a murine myocardial infarction model. We found that hypoxic preconditioning increased CXCR4 expression in CLK (cardiosphere-derived, Lin(-)c-kit(+) progenitor) cells and markedly augmented CLK cell migration (in vitro) and recruitment (in vivo) to the ischemic myocardium. Four weeks after surgically induced myocardial infarction, infarct size and heart function were significantly better in mice administered hypoxia-preconditioned CLK cells than in mice treated with cells cultured under normoxic conditions. Furthermore, these effects were largely abolished by the addition of a CXCR4 inhibitor, indicating that the benefits of hypoxic preconditioning are mediated by the stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCR4 axis, and that therapies targeting this axis may enhance cardiac-progenitor cell-based regenerative therapy.", "journal": "Circulation research", "date": "2009-05-02", "authors": ["Yao LiangTang", "WuqiangZhu", "MinCheng", "LijuanChen", "JohnZhang", "TaoSun", "RajKishore", "M IanPhillips", "Douglas WLosordo", "GangjianQin"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.109.197723"}

{"title": "Directed transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to heart tissue by defined factors.", "abstract": "Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the western world. The heart has little regenerative capacity after damage, leading to much interest in understanding the factors required to produce new cardiac myocytes. Despite a robust understanding of the molecular networks regulating cardiac differentiation, no single transcription factor or combination of factors has been shown to activate the cardiac gene program de novo in mammalian cells or tissues. Here we define the minimal requirements for transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to cardiac myocytes. We show that two cardiac transcription factors, Gata4 and Tbx5, and a cardiac-specific subunit of BAF chromatin-remodelling complexes, Baf60c (also called Smarcd3), can direct ectopic differentiation of mouse mesoderm into beating cardiomyocytes, including the normally non-cardiogenic posterior mesoderm and the extraembryonic mesoderm of the amnion. Gata4 with Baf60c initiated ectopic cardiac gene expression. Addition of Tbx5 allowed differentiation into contracting cardiomyocytes and repression of non-cardiac mesodermal genes. Baf60c was essential for the ectopic cardiogenic activity of Gata4 and Tbx5, partly by permitting binding of Gata4 to cardiac genes, indicating a novel instructive role for BAF complexes in tissue-specific regulation. The combined function of these factors establishes a robust mechanism for controlling cellular differentiation, and may allow reprogramming of new cardiomyocytes for regenerative purposes.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2009-04-28", "authors": ["Jun KTakeuchi", "Benoit GBruneau"], "doi": "10.1038/nature08039"}

The role and function of Apelin in cardiovascular system could be reliably investigated in experimental models devoid of confounding effects reflecting only the natural history of the disease. The pig constitutes a model largely used in experimental pathology where it has a central role in \"in vivo\" clinical settings. Sus Scrofa genoma is not completely sequenced and Apelin gene is still lacking. Aim of this study was to sequence the Apelin in Sus Scrofa for future applications to molecular biology studies. Using the guanidinium thyocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, we extracted total RNA from samples obtained from heart of mouse and from atrium and ventricle of normal pigs. Pig Apelin mRNA was sequenced using polymerase chain reaction primers designed from mouse consensus sequences. A partial sequence of Sus Scrofa Apelin mRNA, 1-201 pb, was submitted to GenBank (accession number FJ362603). The bands obtained from pig cardiac tissue shared a 99% sequence identity with Mus musculus and 90% with Rattus norvegicus.

A significant level of zebrafish vtgAo1, a major estrogen responsive form, has been unexpectedly found in heart tissue in our present studies. Our studies on zebrafish cardiomyopathy, caused by adrenergic agonist treatment, suggest a similar protective function of the cardiac expressed vtgAo1. We hypothesize that its function is to unload surplus intracellular lipids in cardiomyocytes for \"reverse triglyceride transportation\" similar to that found in lipid transport proteins in mammals. Our results also demonstrated that zebrafish vtgAo1 mRNA expression in heart can be suppressed by both alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE) and beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO). Furthermore, the strong stimulation of zebrafish vtgAo1 expression in plasma induced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, MOXIsylyl, was detected by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Such stimulation cannot be suppressed by taMOXIfen, an antagonist to estrogen receptors. Thus, our present data indicate that the production of teleost VTG in vivo can be regulated not only by estrogenic agents, but by adrenergic signals as well.", "journal": "Toxicology and applied pharmacology", "date": "2009-04-18", "authors": ["NaidaYin", "XiaJin", "JiangyanHe", "ZhanYin"], "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2009.04.004"}

Thus, we aimed to investigate the cardiac biochemical parameters and mortality in dichlorvos-induced poisoning in rats. Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups as control (corn oil), dichlorvos, atropine, pralidoxime, and atropine+pralidoxime groups. Immunohistochemical analyses of apoptosis and inducible nitric oxide synthase showed no change in cardiac tissue for all of the groups. Serum cholinesterase levels were suppressed with dichlorvos, and these reductions were inhibited with atropine and/or pralidoxime pretreatment. Serum levels of creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin I, myoglobin, and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide were not affected with poisoning. Malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were not statistically significant between the groups. Although serum nitric oxide levels in the dichlorvos group were lower than those in the control group, cardiac nitric oxide levels in the atropine+pralidoxime group were markedly higher than those in the dichlorvos group. Atropine, pralidoxime, and atropine+pralidoxime pretreatments markedly reduced the mortality. In conclusion, our results implied that measured cardiac markers especially N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide may not contribute to the early (first 6 hours) diagnosis of cardiotoxicity in dichlorvos-induced poisoning in rats. These results also showed that acute dichlorvos administration did not cause significant cardiac damage, and oxidative stress does not play a marked role in dichlorvos-induced poisoning.

The onset of adverse cardiovascular events differs between males and females, and it is generally reported that stress and hormone status are responsible for these differences. The aim of this study was to investigate the heart tissue of adult male and female animals following 28-days of sustained supraphysiological corticosterone levels. Thirty two animals were divided into four equal groups. Male animals in group I and female animals in group III served as control. Male animals in group II and female animals in group IV were surgically implanted with a TCP delivery device containing 50 mg corticosteroid. Twenty-eight days post surgery; the hearts were collected, weighed, and processed for histological evaluations. Histomorphometric measurements including total area, bundle lengths within the ventricles, and the length of the apex were recorded. The length of the apex increased following exposure to corticosterone in both male and female animals. The results also indicate an increase in the length of the ventricular bundles on the left side of the heart in the male animals exposed to corticosterone when compared to the male control heart tissues. No differences were seen in the female animals in the ventricular bundle lengths when compared with female control animals. The data suggests the possibility of structural differences in the heart that are gender related suggestive of hypertrophy or cardiomyopathic changes.", "journal": "Biomedical sciences instrumentation", "date": "2009-04-17", "authors": ["HamedBenghuzzi", "PatrickPowell", "MichelleTucci", "JosephCameron"], "doi": null}

PLB is a membrane protein that regulates calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by inhibition of the cardiac calcium pump (SERCA2a). Phosphorylation of PLB relieves SERCA inhibition, thus enhancing diastolic relaxation and preload.\nOur Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved this research. Swine myocardia from six groups were flash frozen immediately upon death or sacrifice. Groups 1-6 received: (1) no medications, (2) HDI and glucose only, (3) toxic propranolol infusions and saline resuscitation, (4) toxic propranolol infusions and HDI resuscitation, (5) toxic verapamil infusions and saline resuscitation, and (6) toxic verapamil infusions and HDI resuscitation. Groups 3-6 were resuscitated for 4 h. Tissue samples from all six groups were analyzed by quantitative immunoblots, using antibodies to both unphosphorylated PLB (uPLB) and phosphorylated PLB (pPLB), to determine the total PLB content and the fraction of PLB phosphorylated.\nThere were no differences in either pPLB or total PLB in cardiac tissue among any of the six groups. However, infusion of a pig with the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, produced enhanced PLB phosphorylation.\nThe mechanism by which HDI produces its inotropic and lusitropic effects in CCB- and BB-induced cardiovascular toxicity, resulting in resuscitation, is not due to changes in phosphorylation of PLB or a change in the total PLB in the SR.", "journal": "Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "date": "2009-04-15", "authors": ["Naa-AdjeleyAblorh", "FlorentinNitu", "KristinEngebretsen", "David DThomas", "Joel SHolger"], "doi": "10.1080/15563650902870269"}
{"title": "Successful expansion but not complete restriction of tropism of adeno-associated virus by in vivo biopanning of random virus display peptide libraries.", "abstract": "Targeting viral vectors to certain tissues in vivo has been a major challenge in gene therapy. Cell type-directed vector capsids can be selected from random peptide libraries displayed on viral capsids in vitro but so far this system could not easily be translated to in vivo applications. Using a novel, PCR-based amplification protocol for peptide libraries displayed on adeno-associated virus (AAV), we selected vectors for optimized transduction of primary tumor cells in vitro. However, these vectors were not suitable for transduction of the same target cells under in vivo conditions. We therefore performed selections of AAV peptide libraries in vivo in living animals after intravenous administration using tumor and lung tissue as prototype targets. Analysis of peptide sequences of AAV clones after several rounds of selection yielded distinct sequence motifs for both tissues. The selected clones indeed conferred gene expression in the target tissue while gene expression was undetectable in animals injected with control vectors. However, all of the vectors selected for tumor transduction also transduced heart tissue and the vectors selected for lung transduction also transduced a number of other tissues, particularly and invariably the heart. This suggests that modification of the heparin binding motif by target-binding peptide insertion is necessary but not sufficient to achieve tissue-specific transgene expression.

A unifying understanding of myocardial mechanics that would account for these dynamic aspects of IC is lacking.\nWe determined the time course of 3-dimensional finite strains in the anterior LV of 14 adult mongrel dogs in vivo during IC and ejection with biplane cineradiography of implanted transmural markers. Transmural fiber orientations were histologically measured in the heart tissue postmortem. The strain time course was determined in the subepicardial, midwall, and subendocardial layers referenced to the end-diastolic configuration.\nDuring IC, there was circumferential stretch in the subepicardial layer, whereas circumferential shortening was observed in the midwall and the subendocardial layer. There was significant longitudinal shortening and wall thickening across the wall. Although longitudinal tissue velocity showed a biphasic profile; tissue deformation in the longitudinal as well as other directions was almost linear during IC. Subendocardial fibers shortened, whereas subepicardial fibers lengthened. During ejection, all strain components showed a significant change over time that was greater in magnitude than that of IC. Significant transmural gradient was observed in all normal strains.\nIC is a dynamic phase characterized by deformation in circumferential, longitudinal, and radial directions. Tissue mechanics during IC, including fiber shortening, appear uninterrupted by rapid longitudinal motion created by mitral valve closure. This study is the first to report layer-dependent deformation of circumferential strain, which results from layer-dependent deformation of myofibers during IC.

The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the parasympathetic cardiac dysautonomia are not fully elucidated yet.\nChronic renal failure was induced in rats by 5/6 nephrectomy. Blood pressure, resting heart rate and plasma levels of creatinine, urea and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were measured. To characterize the parasympathetic innervation of the heart, chronotropic responses to atropine, metipranolol and to vagal stimulation in the absence or presence of ADMA were investigated in vivo. In vitro, chronotropic and inotropic effects of carbachol and ADMA and mRNA expression of muscarinic M2 receptors, high affinity choline transporter (CHT1), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were assessed in the isolated cardiac tissues.\nIn 5/6 nephrectomy rats, the resting heart rate was significantly higher and the parasympathetic tone, measured as the effect of atropine after administration of metipranolol was significantly lower than in control animals. Plasma ADMA levels were significantly elevated in the uraemic rats and significantly inversely correlated with the effect of atropine on the heart rate. No differences were revealed in the plasma norepinephrine concentrations, negative chronotropic responses to stimulation of the vagus nerves, chronotropic and inotropic responses to carbachol and the relative expression of M2 receptors, CHT1, VAChT and ChAT.\nThe data suggest that cardioacceleration in chronic renal failure is caused by a diminished cardiac parasympathetic tone in the presence of a functionally intact intrinsic cardiac cholinergic signalling system.", "journal": "Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association", "date": "2009-03-27", "authors": ["JitkaKuncov\u00e1", "JitkaSv\u00edglerov\u00e1", "WolfgangKummer", "DanielRajdl", "MagdalenaChottov\u00e1-Dvor\u00e1kov\u00e1", "ZbynekTonar", "Luk\u00e1sNalos", "MilanStengl"], "doi": "10.1093/ndt/gfp123"}

{"title": "Cardioprotective effect of lipistat against doxorubicin induced myocardial toxicity in albino rats.", "abstract": "Preventive role of lipistat against doxorubicin induced myocardial toxicity in rats has been reported. Cardiotoxicity was produced by doxorubicin administration (15 mg/kg for 2 weeks). Lipistat (350 mg/kg, orally) was administered as pretreatment for 2 weeks and then for 2 weeks alternated with doxorubicin. The general observations, mortality, histopathology, biomarker enzymes like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), serum lipid profiles like total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were monitored after 3 weeks of last dose. Pretreatment with the lipistat significantly protected myocardium from the toxic effects of doxorubicin by reducing the elevated level of biomarker enzymes like LDH and CPK to the normal and serum lipids such as total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL back to normal. Lipistat increases the decreased level of GSH, SOD and CAT and decreases the increased level of malondialdehyde in cardiac tissue. The repeated administration of doxorubicin causes cardiomyopathy associated with an antioxidant deficit and increased level of lipid profiles by interfering with fatty acid metabolism.

The present study investigated the cytotoxic and hemolytic activities of crude venom extract of N. nomurai using a number of in vitro assays. The jellyfish venom showed a much higher cytotoxic activity in H9C2 heart myoblast than in C2C12 skeletal myoblast (LC(50)=2 microg/mL vs. 12 microg/mL, respectively), suggesting its possible in vivo selective toxicity on cardiac tissue. This result is consistent with our previous finding that cardiovascular function is a target of the venom. In order to determine the stability of N. nomurai venom, its cytotoxicity was examined under the various temperature and pH conditions. The activity was relatively well retained at low environmental temperature (<or=20 degrees C) and dramatically lost at high temperature (>or=60 degrees C). In pH stability test, the venom has abruptly lost its activity at low pH environment (pH<or=4). Interestingly enough, however, its activity was not significantly affected even at the highest pH environment tested (pH<or=12) in the present study. Additionally, hemolytic activity of the venom was examined using the erythrocytes of cat, dog, human, rabbit and rat. Venom concentration-dependent hemolysis could be observed from 10 microg/mL of protein equivalents or higher with variable potencies in different species, among which dog erythrocyte was the most susceptible to the venom (EC(50)=151 microg/mL).

Patients with GSDIII commonly exhibit hypoglycemia, along with variable organ dysfunction of the liver, muscle or heart tissues. The AGL protein binds to glycogen through its C-terminal region, and possesses two separate domains for the transferase and glucosidase activities. Most causative mutations are nonsense, and how they affect the enzyme is not well understood. Here we investigated four rare missense mutations to determine the molecular basis of how they affect AGL function leading to GSDIII. The L620P mutant primarily abolishes transferase activity while the R1147G variant impairs glucosidase function. Interestingly, mutations in the carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD; G1448R and Y1445ins) are more severe in nature, leading to significant loss of all enzymatic activities and carbohydrate binding ability, as well as enhancing targeting for proteasomal degradation. This region (Y1445-G1448R) displays virtual identity across human and bacterial species, suggesting an important role that has been conserved throughout evolution. Our results clearly indicate that inactivation of either enzymatic activity is sufficient to cause GSDIII disease and suggest that the CBD of AGL plays a major role to coordinate its functions and regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.", "journal": "Human molecular genetics", "date": "2009-03-21", "authors": ["AlanCheng", "MeiZhang", "MinoruOkubo", "KaoruOmichi", "Alan RSaltiel"], "doi": "10.1093/hmg/ddp128"}

Atypically for hantaviruses, it had extensive cytopathic effects. Using a random PCR approach, it was identified as a novel murine adenovirus, MAdV-3 (for MAdV type 3). A plaque-purified virus clone was prepared and further characterized. The complete genome sequence of MAdV-3 was determined to be 30,570 bp in length. Sequence comparisons to other adenovirus species revealed highest similarity to MAdV-1, the representative of the murine adenovirus A species. However, substantial differences were found in the E1, E3, and E4 genomic regions. The phylogenetic distance of MAdV-3 amino acid sequences for pVIII, protease, polymerase, and hexon from MAdV-1 is markedly higher than 0.1 exchange per position, and, based on our cross-neutralization experiments, MAdV-3 and MAdV-1 can be regarded as different serotypes. Therefore, we propose to classify MAdV-3 as the first isolate of a novel adenovirus species, designated murine adenovirus C (MAdV-C). The novel MAdV-3 virus is not only genetically and serologically distinct from MAdV-1 but also shows a unique organ tropism in infected mice. In contrast to MAdV-1, the virus was not detectable in brain but predominantly infected heart tissue.

In H9c2 cardiomyotubes, knockdown of AQP7 was associated with a significant reduction of glycerol uptake. The ex vivo heart study demonstrated that cardiac glycerol consumption levels in KO mice were significantly lower than those of WT mice.

{"title": "Study on Tibetan Chicken embryonic adaptability to chronic hypoxia by revealing differential gene expression in heart tissue.", "abstract": "Oxygen concentration is essential for appropriate metabolism. Hypoxia can exert a significant impact on physiological alteration of the cell and organism. Tibetan Chicken (Gallus gallus) is a Chinese indigenous breed inhabiting in Tibetan areas, which is also a chicken breed living at high altitude for the longest time in the world. It has developed an adaptive mechanism to hypoxia, which is demonstrated by that Tibetan Chicken has much higher hatchability than low-land chicken breeds in high-altitude areas of Tibet. In the present study, Tibetan Chicken fertilized full sib eggs were incubated up to Hamburger-Hamilton stage 43 under 13% and 21% oxygen concentration, respectively. Shouguang Chicken and Dwarf Recessive White Chicken were used as control groups. The hearts in all of the 3 chicken breeds under hypoxic and normoxic conditions were isolated and hybridized to GeneChip(R) Chicken Genome Array to study molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation to high altitude of Tibetan Chicken. As a result, 50 transcripts highly expressed in hypoxia are screened out. Among up-regulated genes, some are involved in the gene ontology (GO) such as cell growth, cell difference, muscle contraction and signal transduction. However, the expression levels of 21 transcripts are lower in hypoxia than those in normoxia. Some down-regulated genes take part in cell communication, ion transport, protein amino acid phosphorylation and signal transduction. Interestingly, gene enrichment analyses of these differential gene expressions are mainly associated with immune system response and ion channel activity in response to stimulus. Moreover, the transcriptional expression profiles analyzed by hierarchical clustering and CPP-SOM software in all of the 3 different chicken breeds revealed that Tibetan Chicken is much closely related to Shouguang Chicken rather than Dwarf Recessive White Chicken. In addition, 12 transcripts of Tibetan Chicken breed-specific expressed genes were identified, which seem to result in a more effective and efficient induction of energy demand and signal transduction of transcription and suppression of abnormal development in response to hypoxia. These findings will be beneficial in clarifying the adaptive molecular mechanism of Tibetan Chicken as well as providing new insight into cardiovascular disease at high altitude medicine.", "journal": "Science in China.

{"title": "Dihydropyridine block of voltage-dependent K+ currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.", "abstract": "The dihydropyridines nifedipine, nimodipine and Bay K 8644 are widely used as pharmacological tools to assess the contribution of L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels to a variety of neuronal processes including synaptic transmission, excitability and second messenger signaling. These compounds are still used in neuronal preparations despite evidence from cardiac tissue and heterologous expression systems that they block several voltage-dependent K(+) (Kv) channels. Both because these compounds have been used to assess the relative contribution of L-type Ca(2+) channels to several different processes in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and because a relatively wide variety of Kv channels present in other neuronal populations is present in DRG neurons, we determined the extent to which dihydropyridines block Kv currents in these neurons. Standard whole cell patch clamp techniques were used to study acutely disassociated adult rat DRG neurons. All three dihydropyridines tested blocked Kv currents in DRG neurons; IC(50) values (concentration resulting in an inhibition that is 50% of maximum) for nifedipine and nimodipine-induced block of sustained Kv currents were 14.5 and 6.6 microM, respectively. The magnitude of sustained current block was 44+/-1.6%, 60+/-2%, and 56+/-2.9% with 10 microM nifedipine, nimodipine and Bay K 8644, respectively. Current block was occluded by neither 4-aminopyridine (5 mM) nor tetraethylammonium (135 mM). Dihydropyridine-induced block of Kv currents was not associated with a shift in the voltage-dependence of current activation or inactivation, the recovery from inactivation, or voltage dependent block. However, there was a small use-dependence to the dihydropyridine-induced block. Our results suggest that several types of Kv channels in DRG neurons are blocked by mechanisms distinct from those underlying block of Kv channels in cardiac myocytes. Importantly, our results suggest that if investigators wish to explore the contribution of L-type Ca(2+) channels to neuronal function, they should consider alternative strategies for the manipulation of these channels than the use of dihydropyridines.", "journal": "Neuroscience", "date": "2009-03-18", "authors": ["X-LZhang", "M SGold"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.03.012"}

Conductive polymers have demonstrated potential for use as a medium for electrical stimulation, which has shown to be beneficial in many regenerative medicine strategies including neural and cardiac tissue engineering. Melanins are naturally occurring pigments that have previously been shown to exhibit unique electrical properties. This study evaluates the potential use of melanin films as a semiconducting material for tissue engineering applications. Melanin thin films were produced by solution processing and the physical properties were characterized. Films were molecularly smooth with a roughness (R(ms)) of 0.341 nm and a conductivity of 7.00+/-1.10 x 10(-5)S cm(-1) in the hydrated state. In vitro biocompatibility was evaluated by Schwann cell attachment and growth as well as neurite extension in PC12 cells. In vivo histology was evaluated by examining the biomaterial-tissue response of melanin implants placed in close proximity to peripheral nerve tissue. Melanin thin films enhanced Schwann cell growth and neurite extension compared to collagen films in vitro. Melanin films induced an inflammation response that was comparable to silicone implants in vivo. Furthermore, melanin implants were significantly resorbed after 8 weeks.

Experimental studies suggested that fibroblasts are electrically coupled to myocytes and this coupling can impact cardiac electrophysiology. In this work, we present a novel approach for mathematical modeling of electrical conduction in cardiac tissue composed of myocytes, fibroblasts, and the extracellular space. The model is an extension of established cardiac bidomain models, which include a description of intra-myocyte and extracellular conductivities, currents and potentials in addition to transmembrane voltages of myocytes. Our extension added a description of fibroblasts, which are electrically coupled with each other and with myocytes. We applied the extended model in exemplary computational simulations of plane waves and conduction in a thin tissue slice assuming an isotropic conductivity of the intra-fibroblast domain. In simulations of plane waves, increased myocyte-fibroblast coupling and fibroblast-myocyte ratio reduced peak voltage and maximal upstroke velocity of myocytes as well as amplitudes and maximal downstroke velocity of extracellular potentials. Simulations with the thin tissue slice showed that inter-fibroblast coupling affected rather transversal than longitudinal conduction velocity. Our results suggest that fibroblast coupling becomes relevant for small intra-myocyte and/or large intra-fibroblast conductivity.

{"title": "Spiral-wave turbulence and its control in the presence of inhomogeneities in four mathematical models of cardiac tissue.", "abstract": "Regular electrical activation waves in cardiac tissue lead to the rhythmic contraction and expansion of the heart that ensures blood supply to the whole body. Irregularities in the propagation of these activation waves can result in cardiac arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), which are major causes of death in the industrialised world. Indeed there is growing consensus that spiral or scroll waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue are associated with VT, whereas, when these waves break to yield spiral- or scroll-wave turbulence, VT develops into life-threatening VF: in the absence of medical intervention, this makes the heart incapable of pumping blood and a patient dies in roughly two-and-a-half minutes after the initiation of VF. Thus studies of spiral- and scroll-wave dynamics in cardiac tissue pose important challenges for in vivo and in vitro experimental studies and for in silico numerical studies of mathematical models for cardiac tissue. A major goal here is to develop low-amplitude defibrillation schemes for the elimination of VT and VF, especially in the presence of inhomogeneities that occur commonly in cardiac tissue. We present a detailed and systematic study of spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence and spatiotemporal chaos in four mathematical models for cardiac tissue, namely, the Panfilov, Luo-Rudy phase 1 (LRI), reduced Priebe-Beuckelmann (RPB) models, and the model of ten Tusscher, Noble, Noble, and Panfilov (TNNP). In particular, we use extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the interaction of spiral and scroll waves in these models with conduction and ionic inhomogeneities; we also examine the suppression of spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence by low-amplitude control pulses. Our central qualitative result is that, in all these models, the dynamics of such spiral waves depends very sensitively on such inhomogeneities. We also study two types of control schemes that have been suggested for the control of spiral turbulence, via low amplitude current pulses, in such mathematical models for cardiac tissue; our investigations here are designed to examine the efficacy of such control schemes in the presence of inhomogeneities. We find that a local pulsing scheme does not suppress spiral turbulence in the presence of inhomogeneities; but a scheme that uses control pulses on a spatially extended mesh is more successful in the elimination of spiral turbulence.

Only a limited selection of publications, however, address the development of numerical techniques for mechanoelectric simulations where cardiac electrophysiology is coupled with deformation of cardiac tissue. One problem commonly encountered in mechanoelectric simulations is instability of the coupled numerical scheme. In this study, we develop a stable numerical scheme for mechanoelectric simulations. A number of convergence tests are carried out using this stable technique for simulations where deformations are of the magnitude typically observed in a beating heart. These convergence tests demonstrate that accurate computation of tissue deformation requires a nodal spacing of around 1 mm in the mesh used to calculate tissue deformation.

Rats were paradoxically deprived of sleep (PSD) by the platform technique for 24 or 96 h, or chronically sleep-restricted (SR) for 21 days. We also sought to verify the time course of their recovery after 24 h of rebound sleep. The results showed DNA damage in blood cells of rats submitted to PSD for 96 h.

Rats allowed to recover from the PSD-96 h and SR-21 days treatments showed DNA damage as compared to negative controls. Liver and heart did not display any genotoxicity activity. Corticosterone concentrations were increased after PSD (24 and 96 h) relative to control rats, whereas these levels were unaffected in the SR group.

To reach this goal, the scientific community needs to find a good source of stem cells that can be used to obtain new myocardium in a very period range of time. Since there are many ethical and technical problems with using embryonic stem cells as a source of cells with cardiogenic potential, many laboratories have attempted to isolate potential cardiac stem cells from several tissues. The best candidates seem to be cardiac \"progenitor\" and/or \"stem\" cells, which can be isolated from subendocardial biopsies from the same patient or from embryonic and/or fetal myocardium. Regardless of the technique used to isolate and characterize these cells, it appears that the different cells isolated from adult myocardium to date are all phenotypic variations of a unique cell type that expresses several markers, such as c-Kit, CD34, MDR-1, Sca-1, CD45, nestin, or Isl-1, in various combinations.", "journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "date": "2009-02-28", "authors": ["ValentinaDi Felice", "AngelaDe Luca", "Maria LuisaColorito", "AntonellaMontalbano", "Nella MariaArdizzone", "FilippoMacaluso", "Antonella MarinoGammazza", "FrancescoCappello", "GiovanniZummo"], "doi": "10.1002/ar.20858"}
{"title": "Building the vertebrate heart - an evolutionary approach to cardiac development.", "abstract": "The vertebrate heart is unique among the blood pumps described in metazoans. In contrast to the myoepithelial tubes found in most animal phyla, the vertebrate heart is made up of multilayered myocardial cells surrounded by connective tissue derived from epicardium and endocardium, and endowed with complex valvular, coronary vessel and conduction systems. Despite these profound differences, a common genetic program seems to underlie the specification and differentiation of all the cardiac tissues. In this article, we will review the similarities in the transcriptional networks and signalling mechanisms regulating cardiac development in different animals, as well as the origin of the main differences existing between vertebrate and invertebrate hearts. We will pay special attention to the hypotheses concerning the evolutionary origin of the endothelium and the epicardium from ancestral blood cells and pronephric progenitors, respectively. We can summarize the transition between the invertebrate and the vertebrate heart as the result of the thickening of the primarily myoepithelial cardiac tube which was concomitant with: 1) an inner lining by an endothelium with the ability to transform into mesenchyme; 2) an outer lining derived from an ancestral pronephric glomerular primordium with vasculogenic potential; 3) a neural crest cell population which reaches the heart from the pharyngeal region; 4) the incorporation of new myocardium at both ends from a second heart field and 5) the formation of specialized chambers. The complex interactions between all these elements originated an exceptionally powerful blood pump which allowed vertebrates to reach their characteristically large size and activity.", "journal": "The International journal of developmental biology", "date": "2009-02-28", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 MP\u00e9rez-Pomares", "Juan MGonz\u00e1lez-Rosa", "Ram\u00f3nMu\u00f1oz-Ch\u00e1puli"], "doi": "10.1387/ijdb.072409jp"}

This inhibition may provide feedback in situations where cAMP promotes opening of Ca(2+) channels, allowing fine control of cardiac contraction and rhythmicity in cardiac tissue where AC5 and AC6 predominate. Ca(2+) inhibits the soluble AC core composed of the C1 domain of AC5 (VC1) and the C2 domain of AC2 (IIC2). As observed for holo-AC5, inhibition is biphasic, showing \"high-affinity\" (K(i) = approximately 0.4 microM) and \"low-affinity\" (K(i) = approximately 100 microM) modes of inhibition. At micromolar concentration, Ca(2+) inhibition is nonexclusive with respect to pyrophosphate (PP(i)), a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ATP, but at >100 microM Ca(2+), inhibition appears to be exclusive with respect to PP(i). The 3.0 A resolution structure of Galphas.GTPgammaS/forskolin-activated VC1:IIC2 crystals soaked in the presence of ATPalphaS and 8 microM free Ca(2+) contains a single, loosely coordinated metal ion. ATP soaked into VC1:IIC2 crystals in the presence of 1.5 mM Ca(2+) is not cyclized, and two calcium ions are observed in the 2.9 A resolution structure of the complex. In both of the latter complexes VC1:IIC2 adopts the \"open\", catalytically inactive conformation characteristic of the apoenzyme, in contrast to the \"closed\", active conformation seen in the presence of ATP analogues and Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). Structures of the pyrophosphate (PP(i)) complex with 10 mM Mg(2+) (2.8 A) or 2 mM Ca(2+) (2.7 A) also adopt the open conformation, indicating that the closed to open transition occurs after cAMP release. In the latter complexes, Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) bind only to the high-affinity \"B\" metal site associated with substrate/product stabilization.

The aim of this study was to characterize the cardioprotective potential of rhEPO in an in vivo experimental model of global I/R approximating the clinical cardiac surgical setting and to gain insights into the myocardial binding sites of rhEpo and the mechanism involved in its cardioprotective effect.\nHearts of donor Lewis rats were arrested with cold crystalloid cardioplegia and after 45 min of cold global ischemia grafted heterotopically into the abdomen of recipient Lewis rats. Recipients were randomly assigned to control non-treated or Epo-treated group receiving 5000 U/kg of rhEpo intravenously 20 min prior to reperfusion. At 5 time points 5-1440 min after reperfusion, the recipients (n=6-8 at each point) were sacrificed, blood and native and grafted hearts harvested for subsequent analysis.\nTreatment with rhEpo resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial I/R injury (plasma troponin T) in correlation with preservation of the myocardial redox state (reduced glutathione). The extent of apoptosis (activity of caspase 3 and caspase 9, TUNEL test) in our model was very modest and not significantly affected by rhEpo. Immunostaining of the heart tissue with anti-Epo antibodies showed an exclusive binding of rhEpo to the coronary endothelium with no binding of rhEpo to cardiomyocytes. Administration of rhEpo resulted in a significant increase in nitric oxide (NO) production assessed by plasma nitrite levels. Immunostaining of heart tissue with anti-phospho-eNOS antibodies showed that after binding to the coronary endothelium, rhEpo increased the phosphorylation and thus activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in coronary vessels. There was no activation of eNOS in cardiomyocytes.\nIntravenous administration of rhEpo protects the heart against cold global I/R. Apoptosis does not seem to play a major role in the process of tissue injury in this model. After binding to the coronary endothelium, rhEpo enhances NO production by phosphorylation and thus activation of eNOS in coronary vessels. Our results suggest that cardioprotective properties of rhEpo are at least partially mediated by NO released by the coronary endothelium.", "journal": "European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery", "date": "2009-02-25", "authors": ["DeyanMihov", "NikolayBogdanov", "BeatGrenacher", "MaxGassmann", "GregorZ\u00fcnd", "AnnaBogdanova", "RezaTavakoli"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejcts.2008.12.049"}

In both experiments, Atlantic salmon were intraperitonally injected with putatively infective material. The first experiment was carried out in fresh water, using cardiac tissue, blood plasma and cell cultured material as inoculates. In the second experiment, various tissues sampled from fish in the mid-outbreak phase were used to inoculate experimental fish in sea water. Also, cardiac tissue sampled before and after the outbreak phase was used. Finally, cardiac tissue pre-treated with chloroform was tested.

Here, we discuss evidence that the increased levels of corticosterone that occur following Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice is an endocrine response that protects the host by impeding an excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Comparative studies between susceptible C57Bl/6J and resistant Balb/c mice indicate that the predisposition to the disease depends on the appropriate timing and magnitude of the activation of the HPA axis. However, this endocrine response also results in thymus atrophy and depletion of CD4(+)CD8(+) by apoptosis. On the other hand, using tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor knockout mice, we found that TNF-alpha plays a complex role during this disease; it is involved in the mediation of cardiac tissue damage but it also contributes to prolonged survival.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of modulating the ratios of the three cell types and to spatially and temporally track cardiac tri-cultures of cells. Primary neonatal cardiac fibroblasts and D4T endothelial cells were incubated in 5 microM CellTracker green dye and CellTracker red dye, respectively, while neonatal cardiomyocytes were labelled with 20 microg/mL DAPI.

We also varied the seeding percentage of cardiomyocytes while keeping the total cell number constant in an attempt to improve the functional properties of the organoids. Organoids were imaged on days 1 and 4.

{"title": "P2 purinergic receptor mRNA in rat and human sinoatrial node and other heart regions.", "abstract": "It is known that adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is a cotransmitter in the heart. Additionally, ATP is released from ischemic and hypoxic myocytes. Therefore, cardiac-derived sources of ATP have the potential to modify cardiac function. ATP activates P2X(1-7) and P2Y(1-14) receptors; however, the presence of P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes in strategic cardiac locations such as the sinoatrial node has not been determined. An understanding of P2X and P2Y receptor localization would facilitate investigation of purine receptor function in the heart. Therefore, we used quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization to measure the expression of mRNA of all known purine receptors in rat left ventricle, right atrium and sinoatrial node (SAN), and human right atrium and SAN. Expression of mRNA for all the cloned P2 receptors was observed in the ventricles, atria, and SAN of the rat. However, their abundance varied in different regions of the heart. P2X(5) was the most abundant of the P2X receptors in all three regions of the rat heart. In rat left ventricle, P2Y(1), P2Y(2), and P2Y(14) mRNA levels were highest for P2Y receptors, while in right atrium and SAN, P2Y(2) and P2Y(14) levels were highest, respectively. We extended these studies to investigate P2X(4) receptor mRNA in heart from rats with coronary artery ligation-induced heart failure. P2X(4) receptor mRNA was upregulated by 93% in SAN (P < 0.05), while a trend towards an increase was also observed in the right atrium and left ventricle (not significant). Thus, P2X(4)-mediated effects might be modulated in heart failure. mRNA for P2X(4-7) and P2Y(1,2,4,6,12-14), but not P2X(2,3) and P2Y(11), was detected in human right atrium and SAN. In addition, mRNA for P2X(1) was detected in human SAN but not human right atrium. In human right atrium and SAN, P2X(4) and P2X(7) mRNA was the highest for P2X receptors. P2Y(1) and P2Y(2) mRNA were the most abundant for P2Y receptors in the right atrium, while P2Y(1), P2Y(2), and P2Y(14) were the most abundant P2Y receptor subtypes in human SAN.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of diosgenin on lysosomal hydrolases, membrane-bound enzymes, and electrolytes during isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial necrosis in rats. Animals were pretreated with DIOS (80 mg/kg) for a period of 35 days. Myocardial infarction was experimentally induced with ISO (85 mg/kg) twice at 24 h interval. Experimental myocardial infarction was evidenced with marked elevation of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in serum with concomitant increase in lipid peroxidation (plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hydroperoxides (HP)). Activity of lysosomal hydrolases (beta-glucuronidase, beta-N-acetyl glucosaminidase, beta-D-galactosidase, cathepsin D, and acid phosphatase) was found to be increased in serum and heart tissue of ISO-alone treated animals. DIOS (80 mg/kg) pretreated groups showed significant decrease in CK-MB, lipid peroxidation, and lysosomal hydrolases activity. The membrane-bound enzymes such as Ca2+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase activity was increased and Na+/K+-ATPase activity was decreased in the heart tissues of ISO-alone treated animals. These enzyme alterations lead to the change in the electrolytes content such as sodium, potassium, and calcium in the heart tissue. However, DIOS (80 mg/kg) pretreatment reversed the membrane-bound enzymes activity and thereby maintained the normal electrolyte concentration. These results suggest the protective action of diosgenin in ISO-induced myocardial infarction.

Confocal immunofluorescent and immunogold electron microscopy, together with subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblot analyses and transport measurements, localized functional Mrp1 to mitochondria after DOX. Expressions of Mrp1 in heart homogenate, sarcolemma, and submitochondrial particles (SMP) were increased 1.6-, 2-, and 3-fold, respectively, at 24 h after DOX. Mitochondrial Mrp1 expression was markedly increased 72 h after DOX, whereas transport of Mrp1 substrates in SMP was maximal at 24 h. ATP-dependent transport in SMP occurred into an osmotically sensitive space and was inhibited by the anti-MRP1 antibody QCRL3. Adduction of a 190-kDa protein with the reactive lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) was detected in SMP and was maximal at 72 h after DOX; immunoprecipitation confirmed Mrp1-HNE adduction. In vitro, HNE (10 muM) inhibited mitochondrial respiration and transport activity in SMP, suggesting that Mrp1 is adversely affected by oxidative stress. These data demonstrate that after DOX, functional Mrp1 is detected in mitochondria in addition to that in sarcolemma; however, adduction with HNE inhibits Mrp1 activity.

Xenogenic ECM scaffolds derived from porcine urinary bladder were implanted into a full-thickness, surgically induced, right ventricular-free wall defect in a dog model. Zero, 2, and 8 weeks following implantation, regional function and myocyte content were determined in each patch region. Regional function did not significantly increase from 0 to 2 weeks. At 8 weeks, however, regional stroke work increased to 3.7 +/- 0.7% and systolic contraction increased to 4.4 +/- 1.2%. The myocyte content also significantly increased during that period generating a linear relationship between regional function and myocyte content.

The volumes of heart receiving 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 Gy were significantly lower for lateral PBI compared with WBI. For medial PBI, significant cardiac sparing was only seen at a dose of 20 Gy. The difference of D5 values was significant for lateral PBI compared with WBI (p=0.008), but not for medial PBI compared with WBI (p=0.84). The mean dose was also significantly lower for lateral PBI compared with WBI (p=0.008), but not for medial PBI (p=0.16). The results from BED calculations did not change this outcome. Both 3D conformal PBI and standard WBI can deliver relatively low doses to the heart. For patients with lateralized tumor beds, PBI offers significant cardiac sparing compared with WBI. Patients with medial lesions have relatively similar heart dosimetry with PBI and WBI. 3D conformal PBI is an emerging treatment modality and continued participation on clinical trials is encouraged. Patients with left-sided lesions and lateralized tumor beds warrant special consideration for PBI, given the significant cardiac dose sparing.", "journal": "Journal of applied clinical medical physics", "date": "2009-02-19", "authors": ["Ashley AGale", "Anudh KJain", "Laura AVallow", "Christopher FSerago", "Steven JBuskirk", "Michael GHeckman"], "doi": "10.1120/jacmp.v10i1.2868"}

Replacement of infarcted heart tissue with regenerating myocardium from endogenous progenitor pools or exogenously introduced stem cells remains a therapeutic ideal. Their impracticality mainly lies in their low efficiency in cardiogenic differentiation (CD). Our recent studies with an acute MI animal model have already demonstrated the therapeutic effect of the MeOH extract of Geum japonicum (EGJ), providing clear evidence of myocardial regeneration.\nThe present study further isolated the active component contained in EGJ using bioassay-guided isolation and investigated its efficacy in the treatment of infarcted heart in animal MI models. We demonstrated that substantial repair of infarcted heart in animal MI models by EGJ can be mimicked by the isolated candidate compound (cardiogenin) in MI animal models. Clear evidence of newly regenerated endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived cardiomyocytes was observed throughout the infarct zone, accompanied by significantly improved functional performance of the heart. Transplantation of MSCs pretreated with EGJ or cardiogenin into a MI animal model also resulted in substantial regeneration of functional myocardium, implying that the activated MSCs carry all the necessary blueprints for myocardial regeneration. Signaling pathways specific to cell survival, CD identified in embryonic heart induction and angiogenesis were activated in both cardiogenin-treated MSCs and cardiogenin-induced regenerating myocardium.\nThis study has demonstrated the therapeutic effects of cardiogenin in infarcted heart repair, and identified the associated signalling pathways for effective cardiogenic differentiation of MSCs, cell survival and angiogenesis.

MinK-related peptides (MiRPs), encoded by KCNE genes, are single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunits that form complexes with Kv channel alpha-subunits to modify their function. Mutations in human MinK (KCNE1) and MiRP1 (KCNE2) are associated with inherited and acquired forms of long QT syndrome (LQTS). Here, coimmunoprecipitations from rat heart tissue suggested that both MinK and MiRP1 form native cardiac complexes with Kv2.1. In whole-cell voltage-clamp studies of subunits expressed in CHO cells, rat MinK and MiRP1 reduced Kv2.1 current density three- and twofold, respectively; slowed Kv2.1 activation (at +60 mV) two- and threefold, respectively; and slowed Kv2.1 deactivation less than twofold. Human MinK slowed Kv2.1 activation 25%, while human MiRP1 slowed Kv2.1 activation and deactivation twofold. Inherited mutations in human MinK and MiRP1, previously associated with LQTS, were also evaluated. D76N-MinK and S74L-MinK reduced Kv2.1 current density (threefold and 40%, respectively) and slowed deactivation (60% and 80%, respectively). Compared to wild-type human MiRP1-Kv2.1 complexes, channels formed with M54T- or I57T-MiRP1 showed greatly slowed activation (tenfold and fivefold, respectively).

Significant decreases in plasma ANG-(1-12), ANG I, and ANG II levels postnephrectomy accompanied increases in cardiac ANG-(1-12), ANG I, and ANG II concentrations compared with controls. Plasma ANG-(1-12) decreased 34% following nephrectomy, which accompanied 78 and 66% decreases in plasma ANG I and ANG II, respectively (P < 0.05 vs. controls). Contrastingly, cardiac ANG-(1-12) in anephric rats averaged 276 +/- 24 fmol/mg compared with 144 +/- 20 fmol/mg in controls (P < 0.005). Cardiac ANG I and ANG II values were 300 +/- 15 and 62 +/- 7 fmol/mg, respectively, in anephric rats compared with 172 +/- 8 fmol/mg for ANG I and 42 +/- 4 fmol/mg for ANG II in controls (P < 0.001). Quantitative immunofluorescence revealed significant increases in average grayscale density for cardiac tissue angiotensinogen, ANG I, ANG II, and AT(1) receptors of WKY rats postnephrectomy.

Its clinical use is, however, limited by its dose-limiting cardiomyopathy. The exact mechanism of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy still remains unknown. The goals were to investigate the molecular mechanism of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and cardioprotection by mitoquinone (Mito-Q), a triphenylphosphonium-conjugated analog of coenzyme Q, using a rat model. Rats were treated with DOX, Mito-Q, and DOX plus Mito-Q for 12 weeks. The left ventricular function as measured by two-dimensional echocardiography decreased in DOX-treated rats but was preserved during Mito-Q plus DOX treatment. Using low-temperature ex vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), a time-dependent decrease in heme signal was detected in heart tissues isolated from rats administered with a cumulative dose of DOX. DOX attenuated the EPR signals characteristic of the exchange interaction between cytochrome c oxidase (CcO)-Fe(III) heme a3 and CuB. DOX and Mito-Q together restored these EPR signals and the CcO activity in heart tissues. DOX strongly downregulated the stable expression of the CcO subunits II and Va and had a slight inhibitory effect on CcO subunit I gene expression. Mito-Q restored CcO subunit II and Va expressions in DOX-treated rats.

Antitachycardia pacing is the only low energy defibrillation approach to have gained clinical significance, but it is still suboptimal. Low energy defibrillation would avoid adverse side effects associated with high voltage shocks and allow the application of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, in cases where such therapy is not tolerated today. We present results of computer simulations of a bidomain model of cardiac tissue with human atrial ionic kinetics. Reentry was initiated and low energy shocks were applied with the same period as the reentry, using feedback to maintain resonance. We demonstrate that such stimulation can move the core of reentrant patterns, in the direction that depends on the location of the electrodes and the time delay in the feedback. Termination of reentry is achieved with shock strength one-order-of-magnitude weaker than in conventional single-shock defibrillation. We conclude that resonant drift pacing can terminate reentry at a fraction of the shock strength currently used for defibrillation and can potentially work where antitachycardia pacing fails, due to the feedback mechanisms.

One of the major challenges in the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering is determining how to support the increased metabolic demands of 3-dimensional tissue constructs, due to the increase in both cellular mass and density compared to monolayer cultures. Traditional culture systems rely on passive diffusion for the delivery of oxygen and soluble factors. However, perfusion systems can provide continuous delivery of cell culture media to 3D tissue constructs, which promotes more active delivery of oxygen, soluble factors, and shear stress, which can be utilized to guide tissue maturation and functional remodeling of bioengineered tissues. We have previously described a perfusion system and demonstrated compatibility over short time periods (approximately hours) with 2-dimensional monolayer cell culture and 3-dimensional tissue constructs. The objectives of our current study were to: introduce CO2 buffering to stabilize media pH in order to achieve long term culture within the system, incorporate sensors capable of recording high media oxygen concentrations, and to increase the culture time of bioengineered heart muscle within the perfusion system in order to increase their functional performance.

Experiments were conducted on neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures and heart tissues isolated from wild-type (WT) and TIMP-3(-/-) mice. Deficiency in TIMP-3 decreased p27 expression and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in cardiomyocytes and neonatal hearts. A TIMP-3/epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)/SP-1/p27 pathway was investigated. JNK phosphorylation and EGFR protein levels were increased in TIMP-3(-/-) cardiomyocytes and heart tissues. Treatment with recombinant TIMP-3 decreased JNK phosphorylation and EGFR expression/phosphorylation. Inhibition of JNK activity using SP-600125 decreased SP-1 phosphorylation, increased p27 expression, and decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation. Furthermore, treatment with the EGFR specific inhibitor PD-168393 or the EGF-neutralizing antibody decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation as well as phosphorylation of JNK and SP-1 in both WT and TIMP-3(-/-) cardiomyocytes. We conclude that TIMP-3 inhibits neonatal mouse cardiomyocyte proliferation by upregulating p27 expression.

Calcium and sodium channel blockers altered Ca2+ transients, and isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic compound, increased the rate of beating in d7CMs and d21CMs. Our gene analytic system therefore enabled us to identify genes that are expressed in the physiological pathways associated with ion channels and structural components in d7CMs and d21CMs. We conclude that EBs might be of use for the basic screening of drugs that might affect contractile function through ion channels.", "journal": "Journal of biomolecular screening", "date": "2009-02-13", "authors": ["TadahiroShinozawa", "AkikoTsuji", "KenichiImahashi", "KosukeNakashima", "HiroshiSawada", "HiroyoshiToyoshiba", "SatoshiYamamoto", "KenjiTakami", "RyoetsuImai"], "doi": "10.1177/1087057108330112"}

It reduces cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced cardiotoxicity; this improvement required melatonin's binding to its membrane receptors. This experimental study examined whether melatonin is a useful tool for counteracting CsA-induced apoptosis in the heart of rats. We investigated melatonin's antiapoptotic efficacy in protecting the heart and tested whether this effect was totally dependent on its binding to membrane receptors or also involved radical scavenging. In some animals, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) as a melatonin delivery system were used. In one group of rats, melatonin (1 mg/kg/day i.p.) was given concurrently with CsA (15 mg/kg/day s.c.; CsA-MT) for 21 days. In other animals, melatonin loaded in SLN was injected with CsA (CsA-MTSLN). Oxidative stress in heart tissue was estimated using the evaluation of lipid peroxidation and the expression of the isoform of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS). The antiapoptotic effect of melatonin was evaluated using TUNEL staining and Bcl-2 protein family expression. CsA administration produced morphological and biochemical changes in the heart of rats, while melatonin reversed the changes. In particular, since the antiapoptotic melatonin's efficacy is mainly observed when it is loaded in SLN, we suggest that MT1/MT2 pathway is not sufficient for apoptosis antagonism and the additional intracellular effects may be required. Finally, we show that, (i) melatonin significantly reduces CsA cardiotoxicity acting also on apoptotic processes, and (ii) the reduction in CsA-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated mainly by its antioxidant effect.", "journal": "Journal of pineal research", "date": "2009-02-07", "authors": ["RitaRezzani", "Luigi FabrizioRodella", "FrancoFraschini", "Maria RosaGasco", "GermanaDemartini", "ClaudiaMusicanti", "Russel JReiter"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-079X.2008.00651.x"}

Therefore, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical stretch (0.5 Hz, 5% strain for 48 h) specifically increases EEECT CM proliferation mediated by p38MAPK activity. Cyclic mechanical stretch increased CM, but not non-CM, proliferation and increased p38MAPK phosphorylation. Treatment of EEECT with the p38MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, reduced CM proliferation.

While it is beyond doubt that these cells contribute to normal development of the heart during organogenesis, it remains an open question whether mesothelial epicardial cells can preserve their embryonic potential and if they can undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition, giving origin to cardiac cell lineages, also in the adult human heart. Recent observations in vitro confirm this hypothesis, but direct evidence from the adult human heart is difficult to obtain. We report the absence of epicardial cells from the surface of adult human hearts with ischemic cardiomyopathy and the accumulation of cells with epithelial and mesenchymal markers in the subepicardium. We argue that these findings may correspond to the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chronic pathological conditions requiring cardiac cell regeneration, followed by epicardial cell pool exhaustion. Hence, observation of the epicardium of patients with cardiovascular disease, although not offering immediate diagnostic advantage, could provide some urging answers concerning the self-renewal potential of the adult heart.", "journal": "International journal of cardiology", "date": "2009-01-30", "authors": ["FrancaDi Meglio", "ClotildeCastaldo", "DariaNurzynska", "VeronicaRomano", "RitaMiraglia", "StefaniaMontagnani"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.137"}

In hypertension, the heart is a vital organ that requires examination and investigation, and primary induction of HSPs is predominantly effected. Hypertension results from osmotic imbalance during renin-angiotensin cycle inefficiency. Osmotic stress protein 94 (OSP94) is a stress protein induced upon osmotic imbalance. It is therefore necessary to analyze its precise role in the hypertensive heart. We have first reported the cloning and expression of human heart OSP94 followed by an analysis of gene sequence and protein homology. Directional cloning of OSP94 by PCR amplification yielded a 2.5 kb amplicon and was cloned into pET-15b. Site-directed mutagenesis was essentially followed. mRNA expression levels were evaluated in correlation with HSPs. Gene analysis indicated a 2520 bp sequence with an 838-amino acid protein complement. Protein homology revealed highly conserved sequence similarity among mammalian sequences.

However, some serious issues were frequently raised against the widespread implementation and practicability of the EST in its original version. Most importantly, the evaluation of the morphological endpoint of beating cell agglomerates requires extensive experimental experience and is prone to misjudgment. Also, the testing period of 10 days is too long and costly to be attractive for industries interested in high-throughput screening of potential drug candidates. These drawbacks prompted us to work out a new molecular approach based on analysis of the expression of certain marker proteins specific for developing heart tissue. We have previously reported that quantitative flow cytometry of marker proteins (i.e., sarcomeric myosin heavy chain and alpha-actinin) can be performed at day 7 in embryonic stem cells from mice and combined with concurrent cell viability analysis. In the present study, extensive investigations were performed in order to explore the predictive power and validity of the newly established EST, subsequently referred to as molecular fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-EST, by applying and comparing a set of 10 well-known embryotoxicants that encompasses the full range of chemical inherent embryotoxic potencies possible. While the molecular FACS-EST offered the same sensitivity compared to the validated EST protocol, the test duration could be significantly reduced.

In isolated perfused hearts, recovery of left ventricular function from 40min of global ischemia was improved significantly in Ang-(1-7)- or captopril-treated diabetic SHR and worsened in animals treated with A779, an Ang-(1-7) receptor (AT((1-7))) antagonist. The beneficial effect of captopril on cardiac recovery was reduced when co-administered with A779. Cardiac NF-kappaB activity appears to be higher in diabetic SHR and treatment with Ang-(1-7) or captopril decreased NF-kappaB activity in diabetic SHR, an effect partially reversed by co-administration of A779. Real-time PCR-based gene array analysis of cardiac tissue revealed that Ang-(1-7) or captopril treatment may reduce expression of several genes of inflammation involved in the NF-kappaB signalling pathway.

Increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity is a molecular mechanism promoting increased contractility in failing cardiac tissue. Thus, muscarinic receptor activation could elicit inotropic responses in ventricular myocardium from rats with heart failure, through increasing phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC).\nContractile force was measured in left ventricular papillary muscles from male Wistar rats, 6 weeks after left coronary artery ligation or sham surgery. Muscles were also frozen, and MLC-2 phosphorylation level was quantified.\nCarbachol (10 micromol.L(-1)) evoked a positive inotropic response only in muscles from rats with heart failure approximating 36% of that elicited by 1 micromol.L(-1) isoproterenol (20 +/- 1.5% and 56 +/- 6.1% above basal respectively). Carbachol-evoked inotropic responses did not correlate with infarction size but did correlate with increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure, heart weight/body weight ratio and lung weight, primary indicators of the severity of heart failure. Only muscarinic receptor antagonists selective for M(2) receptors antagonized carbachol-mediated inotropic effects with the expected potency. Carbachol-evoked inotropic responses and increase in phosphorylated MLC-2 were attenuated by MLC kinase (ML-9) and Rho-kinase inhibition (Y-27632), and inotropic responses were abolished by Pertussis toxin pretreatment.\nIn failing ventricular muscle, muscarinic receptor activation, most likely via M(2) receptors, provides inotropic support by increasing MLC phosphorylation and consequently, myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity.

We examined the anti-inflammatory effects of S100A8/A9 on experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in rats.\nExperimental autoimmune myocarditis was induced in Lewis rats by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin.

The mechanisms for the formation and spatiotemporal evolution of these phase-mismatched patterns are not known. We used confocal Ca imaging to measure CaT alternans at the sarcomeric level within individual myocytes in the intact rat heart. After a sudden change in cycle length (CL), 2 distinct spatial patterns of CaT alternans emerge. CaTs can form spatially phase-mismatched alternans patterns after the first few beats following the change in CL. The phase mismatch persists for many beats, after which it gradually becomes phase matched via the movement of nodes, which are junctures between phase-mismatched cell regions. In other examples, phase-matched alternans gradually become phase-mismatched, via the formation and movement of nodes. In these examples, we observed large beat-to-beat variations in the cell activation times, despite constant CL pacing.

Procyanidins from grape seeds are potent free radical scavengers that have been shown to protect against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. In the present study, we tested whether procyanidins would prevent the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were intraperitoneally treated with doxorubicin at a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg with and without pre-administration of procyanidins. Our data showed that doxorubicin led to cardiac function deterioration, myocardial injury and increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissues. The cardiac function deterioration by doxorubicin included increased QT-interval and ST-interval in electrocardiograph (ECG) and decreased left ventricular developed pressure. Doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury was shown by the increased creatine kinase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in serum as well as in myocardial lesions. Pretreatment with procyanidin (150 mg/kg daily) effectively hindered the adverse effects of doxorubicin, such as myocardial injury and impaired heart function. Procyanidin pretreatment attenuated cytoplasmic vacuolization, increased left ventricular developed pressure and improved the ECG. The cardioprotective effect of procyanidin corresponded to the decrease of lipid peroxidation and the increase of cardiac antioxidant potency in doxorubicin-treated rats that were also given procyanidin.

A protective effect of wine polyphenol (PP) extract was also examined. In liver, maximal activities of CII and CII+III mitochondrial complexes were decreased but NADPH oxidase expression (p22(phox) and p47(phox)) and NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide anion production were not modified, whereas oxidative stress (lipid and protein oxidation products and antioxidant systems) was increased with HFHS diet. In muscle, anion superoxide production was slightly increased while mitochondrial complex activities and lipid and protein oxidation products were not modified with HFHS diet. In heart, NADPH oxidase expression and superoxide anion production were increased, and maximal activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes or oxidative stress parameters were not modified. Wine polyphenol extract had an inhibiting effect on liver oxidative stress and on heart NADPH oxidase expression and superoxide anion production, and on induction of hepatic steatosis with HFHS diet. Induction of mitochondrial dysfunction could be a primary event in the development of oxidative stress in liver, while in skeletal muscle and in heart the NADPH oxidase system seems to be mainly involved in oxidative stress.

{"title": "The transfer functions of cardiac tissue during stochastic pacing.", "abstract": "The restitution properties of cardiac action potential duration (APD) and conduction velocity (CV) are important factors in arrhythmogenesis. They determine alternans, wavebreak, and the patterns of reentrant arrhythmias. We developed a novel approach to characterize restitution using transfer functions. Transfer functions relate an input and an output quantity in terms of gain and phase shift in the complex frequency domain. We derived an analytical expression for the transfer function of interbeat intervals (IBIs) during conduction from one site (input) to another site downstream (output). Transfer functions can be efficiently obtained using a stochastic pacing protocol. Using simulations of conduction and extracellular mapping of strands of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, we show that transfer functions permit the quantification of APD and CV restitution slopes when it is difficult to measure APD directly. We find that the normally positive CV restitution slope attenuates IBI variations. In contrast, a negative CV restitution slope (induced by decreasing extracellular [K(+)]) amplifies IBI variations with a maximum at the frequency of alternans. Hence, it potentiates alternans and renders conduction unstable, even in the absence of APD restitution. Thus, stochastic pacing and transfer function analysis represent a powerful strategy to evaluate restitution and the stability of conduction.", "journal": "Biophysical journal", "date": "2009-01-13", "authors": ["Ennode Lange", "Jan PKucera"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2008.09.025"}

In this report, we focus on three primary features of donor dendritic cells: their generation, their trafficking after transplantation, and their role in regulating tolerance versus rejection. Using transgenic mice as donors of heart allografts enabled us to monitor trafficking of donor dendritic cells after transplantation. Donor dendritic cells rapidly migrated into secondary lymphoid tissues within 3 h of transplantation. We found that the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 regulates the generation of heart tissue dendritic cells constitutively. Compared with wild-type hearts, CX3CR1(-/-) hearts contained fewer dendritic cells, and heart allografts from CX3CR1(-/-) donors survived significantly longer without immunosuppression. Unexpectedly, though, co-stimulatory blockade with anti-CD154 or CTLA4-Ig induced long-term survival for wild-type heart allografts but not for CX3CR1(-/-) heart allografts. Increasing the dendritic cell frequency in CX3CR1(-/-) hearts by treatment with Flt3L restored the anti-CD154-induced prolongation of CX3CR1(-/-) heart allograft survival. Compared with wild-type donors, depleting transgenic donors of dendritic cells before heart transplantation also markedly worsened chronic rejection under anti-CD154 treatment.

The specific C-type lectin domain on LOX-1 is essential for ox-LDL binding and internalization, generation of oxidant species and eliciting immune response. Here, we show that LOX-1 deletion alters genes that relate to immune response. Microarray (and qPCR) analysis of cardiac tissues showed downregulated expression of several immunoglobulins (Igk-V8, Igk-C, Igh-6, Igj, Ighg, Igh, and Igl-V1) in the LOX-1 knockout (KO) mice [p<0.05 vs. the wild-type (WT) mice]. The expression of these immunoglobulins was upregulated several-fold in the LOX-1 KO mice hearts when these mice were infused with Ang II (p<0.05, vs. WT mice). Importantly, cultured mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes expressed these immunoglobulins, and pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with a specific anti-LOX-1 antibody enhanced the generation of immunoglobulins upon subsequent exposure to Ang II. These observations mirrored the data obtained from WT and LOX-1 KO mice hearts in the resting state and following Ang II infusion. This study provides first set of data on immunoglobulin expression in cardiac tissues of WT and LOX-1 KO mice and in cultured HL-1 cardiomyocytes, and demonstrates that LOX-1 inactivation leads to upregulation of immunoglobulins in cardiomyocytes upon challenge with Ang II.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2009-01-08", "authors": ["Bum-YongKang", "ChangpingHu", "SastryPrayaga", "MagomedKhaidakov", "TatsuyaSawamura", "Ki-BaeSeung", "Jawahar LMehta"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.12.143"}

Costameres are considered as \"proteic machinery\" that appears to comprise two protein complexes: the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and the vinculin-talin-integrin system. There are structural differences between atrial and ventricular myocytes, but there have been relatively few studies that have analyzed costameres and focal adhesion function in cardiac cells. Our previous study carried out only on atrial myocytes, demonstrated that the DGC and talin-vinculin-integrin complexes had a costameric distribution that, unlike skeletal muscle, it localized only on the I band. We performed a further immunohistochemical analysis extending also the evaluation to the normal human cardiac muscle fibers obtained from ventricle and interventricular septum, in order to define the distribution and the spatial relationship between the proteins of the two complexes also in the other heart districts. Immunoconfocal microscopy of cardiac tissue revealed the costameric distribution of DGC and of vinculin-talin-integrin system, the association of all tested proteins in intercalated disks, in disagreement with other Authors, and in T-tubule with irregular spokelike extensions penetrating toward the center of the cell.

In the current study, we have investigated whether administration of angiotensin II or norepinephrine induces accumulation of lipids and/or changes in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in the rat heart. Lipid deposition was found in myocardial, vascular wall, and perivascular cells of the angiotensin II-infused rat heart, and superoxide generation was increased in these lipid-positive cells. By contrast, intracardiac lipid deposition was not found in the heart of norepinephrine-induced hypertensive rats. Triglyceride content in the heart tissue of angiotensin II-infused rats increased more than 3-fold as compared with untreated controls. Losartan completely, but hydralazine only partially, suppressed the angiotensin II-induced intracardiac lipid deposition and increase in tissue triglyceride content. Administration of angiotensin II upregulated the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and fatty acid synthase, but downregulated that of uncoupling protein 2 and 3, in a manner dependent on the angiotensin AT(1) receptor.

The mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are controversial. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the view that T. cruzi infection elicits severe autoimmune responses in the host, which significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease, and several recent studies have reported the presence of autoantibodies and effector T lymphocytes against parasite and self antigens in infected patients and experimentally infected animals. T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) is a 45kDa protein, immunogenic in humans, rabbits and mice. It has a high degree of homology with human (HuCRT) and mouse calreticulin (MoCRT), which would explain why an immune response to TcCRT could contribute to autoimmune reactions in Chagas' disease. Anti-TcCRT antibodies generated in A/J mice immunized with recombinant TcCRT (rTcCRT) reacted with rHuCRT and bound to neonatal and adult isogenic cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro. Interestingly, histological alterations, such as edema formation and cell infiltrates, which include CD3(+) cells, were detected in heart sections from immunized animals. Therefore, in rTcCRT-immunized mice, an autoimmune reaction against host CRT, paralleled by histological cardiac alterations, suggests a role of the parasite molecule in the induction of immunologically mediated heart tissue damage.

An established rat model of chronic renal failure allowed whole-genome transcriptome analyses as well as the investigation of differential expressed proteins in uremic LVH. The localization of potential biomarkers encoded by candidate genes was done by immunohistochemical analyses of cardiac tissue of the animal model as well as cardiac sections of LVH diseased patients.

One promising alternative replaces cardiac muscle damaged by myocardial infarction with new contractile cardiomyocytes and vessels obtained through stem cell-based regeneration. We report on the state of the art of recovery of cardiac functions by using stem cell engineering. Current research focuses on (a) inducing stem cells into becoming cardiac cells before or after injection into a host, (b) growing replacement heart tissue in vitro, and (c) stimulating the proliferation of the post-mitotic cardiomyocytes in situ. The most promising treatment option for patients is the engineering of new heart tissue that can be implanted into damaged areas. Engineering of cardiac tissue currently employs the use of co-culture of stem cells with scaffold microenvironments engineered to improve tissue survival and enhance differentiation. Growth of heart tissue in vitro using scaffolds, soluble collagen, and cell sheets has unique advantages. To compensate for the loss of ventricular mass and contractility of the injured cardiomyocytes, different stem cell populations have been extensively studied as potential sources of new cells to ameliorate the injured myocardium and eventually restore cardiac function.

Levels of intracellular calcium modulate inactivation gating of NaV1.5, in part through a C-terminal EF-hand calcium binding domain. The significance of this structure is underscored by the fact that mutations within this domain are associated with specific cardiac arrhythmia syndromes. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis for calcium regulation of channel function, we have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal EF-hand domain using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. The structure confirms the existence of the four-helix bundle common to EF-hand domain proteins. However, the location of this domain is shifted with respect to that predicted on the basis of a consensus 12-residue EF-hand calcium binding loop in the sequence. This finding is consistent with the weak calcium affinity reported for the isolated EF-hand domain; high affinity binding is observed only in a construct with an additional 60 residues C-terminal to the EF-hand domain, including the IQ motif that is central to the calcium regulatory apparatus. The binding of an IQ motif peptide to the EF-hand domain was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The peptide binds between helices I and IV in the EF-hand domain, similar to the binding of target peptides to other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. These results suggest a molecular basis for the coupling of the intrinsic (EF-hand domain) and extrinsic (calmodulin) components of the calcium-sensing apparatus of NaV1.5.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2008-12-17", "authors": ["BenjaminChagot", "FranckPotet", "Jeffrey RBalser", "Walter JChazin"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M807747200"}

Plasma S1P is carried in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or bound to albumin and is reported to arise from activated platelets and erythrocytes. In addition, extracellular SK1 released from vascular endothelial cells may also contribute to plasma S1P levels. S1P exerts its effects through a family of five high affinity S1P-specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), S1P(1-5). Various S1P receptors are present in the cardiovascular system, including cardiac tissue. Additionally, intracellular S1P may have a second messenger action. Since S1P is recognised as a survival factor in many tissues, there has been much interest in S1P as a cardioprotective agent. Recent evidence indicates that S1P can pre-condition and post-condition the heart and that the cardioprotective effect of HDL may be because of its S1P content.

Here we report a novel and scalable method to generate scaffold-free human cardiac tissue patches. Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated to cardiomyocytes using activin A and BMP4 and placed into suspension on a rotating orbital shaker. Cells aggregated to form macroscopic disc-shaped patches of beating tissue after 2 days. Patch diameter was directly proportional to input cell number (approximately 11 mm with 12 million cells), and patches were 300-600 mum thick. Cardiomyocytes were concentrated around the patch edges and exhibited increased purity and maturation with time, comprising approximately 80% of total cells after 11 days. Noncardiac cell elements, primarily epithelium, were present at day 2 but were diminished markedly at later time points. Cardiomyocyte proliferation occurred throughout the patches at day 2 but declined by day 8. Patches exhibited automaticity and synchronous calcium transients, indicating electromechanical coupling.

Although expression of all components necessary for a locally derived adipose tissue RAS has been demonstrated within adipose tissue, independence of local adipose RAS component concentrations from corresponding plasma RAS fluctuations has not been addressed. To analyze this, we varied in vivo rat plasma concentrations of two RAS components, renin and angiotensinogen (AGT), to determine the influence of their plasma concentrations on adipose and cardiac tissue levels in both perfused (plasma removed) and nonperfused samples. Variation of plasma RAS components was accomplished by four treatment groups: normal, DOCA salt, bilateral nephrectomy, and losartan. Adipose and cardiac tissue AGT concentrations correlated positively with plasma values. Perfusion of adipose tissue decreased AGT concentrations by 11.1%, indicating that adipose tissue AGT was in equilibrium with plasma. Cardiac tissue renin levels positively correlated with plasma renin concentration for all treatments. In contrast, adipose tissue renin levels did not correlate with plasma renin, with the exception of extremely high plasma renin concentrations achieved in the losartan-treated group. These results suggest that adipose tissue may control its own local renin concentration independently of plasma renin as a potential mechanism for maintaining a functional local adipose RAS.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

Here we describe a novel method for comparing gene expression levels among various tissues or cells by sequence-tagged reverse-transcription PCR coupled with pyrosequencing (termed \"SRPP\"). This method includes three steps: (i) reverse transcription of mRNA with sources-specific RT primers consisting of a tail at the 5'-end for supplying a common PCR priming site, a source-specific sequence in the middle, and a poly-T stretch plus several degenerate bases at the 3'-end for annealing the mRNA strand.

CNTF-induced channel expression requires 12 h stimulation to reach maximal expression and is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis, suggesting the involvement of a post-translational mechanism. In this study, we have investigated the biochemical mechanism responsible for the CNTF-dependent stimulation of T-type channel expression in nodose neurons. Stimulation of nodose neurons with CNTF evoked a considerable increase in signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. CNTF-evoked ERK phosphorylation was transient whereas BDNF-evoked activation of ERK was sustained. Pre-treatment of nodose neurons with the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor P6 blocked STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation, whereas the ERK inhibitor U0126 prevented ERK activation but not STAT3 phosphorylation. Both P6 and U0126 inhibited the stimulatory effect of CNTF on T-type channel expression. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by the selective blocker stattic has no effect on ERK phosphorylation and T-type channel expression. These results indicate that CNTF-evoked stimulation of T-type Ca(2+) channel expression in chicken nodose neurons requires JAK-dependent ERK signaling. A cardiac tissue extract derived from E20 chicken heart was also effective in promoting T-type Ca(2+) channel expression and STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation. The ability of the heart extract to stimulate JAK/STAT and ERK activation was developmentally regulated.

In the CI model, the plasma concentration of norepinephrine (NE) significantly increased at 1, 3, and 7 days post-CI compared to the sham group. The myocardial syntaxin1A mRNA and protein expression also significantly increased at 1 day post-CI compared to the sham group. However, the sepsis-induced increase in syntaxin1A returned to the baseline values at 3 and 7 days post-CI. The expressions of myocardial NET mRNA and protein were not altered at 1 day post-CI but significantly decreased at 3 days post-CI compared to the sham and 1 day post-CI groups. The immunohistochemical analyses revealed an increased localization of NET and syntaxin1A in the heart tissue sections of the 1 day post-CI group. In the CLP model of severe sepsis, the myocardial syntaxin1A mRNA protein expressions significantly increased at 2 h post-CLP, but remained unchanged at 20 h post-CLP compared to the sham group. In contrast, the myocardial expressions of NET mRNA and protein significantly decreased at both 2 and 20 h post-CLP compared to the sham group.

Infarct size, apoptosis, nitrotyrosine content, NO/O2(.-) production, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS)/NADPH oxidase expression were determined. INO-4885 treatment reduced ischemia/reperfusion-induced protein nitration and caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent fashion in the range of 3 to 100 microg/kg. However, doses exceeding 100 microg/kg produced nonspecific effects and attenuated its protective ability.

Concerning the swelling and degradation tests, performed in different solutions simulating body fluids, both swelling degree and weight losses were higher in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and for the blends with a higher content of gelatin. These results indicated a better stability of the blends in cell culture medium than in PBS and suggested a mainly hydrolytic degradation process. Cell culture tests, carried out using C2C12 myoblasts, showed a good cell proliferation for all the blends containing more than 60% of gelatin, with the alginate/gelatin 20:80 showing the best response. The same blend was the only one on which cell differentiation was observed. The results obtained in the biological characterization allow to select the alginate/gelatin 20:80 blend as a suitable material to prepare scaffolds for myocardial tissue engineering.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

{"title": "Cardiac effects of MDMA on the metabolic profile determined with 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the rat.", "abstract": "Despite the potential for deleterious (even fatal) effects on cardiac physiology, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) abuse abounds driven mainly by its euphoric effects. Acute exposure to MDMA has profound cardiovascular effects on blood pressure and heart rate in humans and animals. To determine the effects of MDMA on cardiac metabolites in rats, MDMA (0, 5, or 10 mg/kg) was injected every 2 h for a total of four injections; animals were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection (8 h drug exposure), and their hearts removed and tissue samples from left ventricular wall dissected. High resolution magic angle spinning proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) at 11.7 T, a specialized version of MRS aptly suited for analysis of semi-solid materials such as intact tissue samples, was used to measure the cardiac metabolomic profile, including alanine, lactate, succinate, creatine, and carnitine, in heart tissue from rats treated with MDMA. MDMA effects on MR-visible choline, glutamate, glutamine, and taurine were also determined. Body temperature was measured following each MDMA administration and serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) in heart tissue from treated animals. MDMA significantly and dose-dependently increased body temperature, a hallmark of amphetamines. Serotonin, but not NE, levels were significantly and dose-dependently decreased by MDMA in the heart wall. MDMA significantly altered the MR-visible profile with an increase in carnitine and no change in other key compounds involved in cardiomyocyte energy metabolomics. Finally, choline levels were significantly decreased by MDMA in heart. The results are consistent with the notion that MDMA has significant effects on cardiovascular serotonergic tone and disrupts the metabolic homeostasis of energy regulation in cardiac tissue, potentially increasing utilization of fatty acid metabolism. The contributions of serotonergic signaling on MDMA-induced changes in cardiac metabolism remain to be determined.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2008-11-06", "authors": ["Shane APerrine", "Mark SMichaels", "FarhadGhoddoussi", "Elisabeth MHyde", "Manuel ETancer", "Matthew PGalloway"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.1352"}

Decreases in ventricular size and reductions in systolic and diastolic functions were found, suggestive of a restrictive cardiomyopathy and consistent with an infiltrative myopathic process. Microscopic analysis of mouse hearts showed severe patchy fibrosis in the low-FVII mice. Haemosiderin deposition was discovered in hearts of these mice, along with increases in inflammatory cell number, ultimately resulting in widespread collagen deposition. Significant increases in mRNA levels of TGFbeta, TNFalpha and several matrix metalloproteinases in low-FVII mice, beginning at early ages, supported a state of cardiac remodelling associated with the fibrotic pathology. Mechanistic time-course studies suggested that cardiac fibrosis in low-FVII mice originated from bleeding in heart tissue, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes, which released inflammatory mediators and induced collagen synthesis and secretion. These events led to necrosis of cardiomyocytes and collagen deposition, characteristics of cardiac fibrosis. The results of this study demonstrated that haemorrhagic and inflammatory responses to a severe FVII deficiency resulted in the development of cardiac fibrosis, observed echocardiographically as a restrictive cardiomyopathy, with compromised ventricular diastolic and systolic functions.", "journal": "The Journal of pathology", "date": "2008-11-01", "authors": ["HXu", "FNoria", "M JSandoval-Cooper", "HMenchen", "D LDonahue", "V APloplis", "F JCastellino"], "doi": "10.1002/path.2454"}

Aims of the present study were to examine the acute effects of CVT-3619 on whole-body and cardiac glucose and fatty acid kinetics in vivo in normal and diet-induced insulin-resistant rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a chow (CH) or high-fat (HF) diet for 4 weeks.

After 5 days of recovery, fasted animals (10 h) received either saline or CVT-3619 (0.4 mg/kg bolus + 1 mg/kg/h). Indices of glucose and fatty acid utilization were obtained by the administration of 2-deoxy[(14)C]glucose and [9,10-(3)H]-(R)-2-bromopalmitate. HF feeding resulted in elevated, fasting insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels compared with CH. CVT-3619 caused a 64 and 86% reduction of FFA and insulin in HF (p < 0.05) but less (N.S.) in CH diet-fed animals. In HF diet-fed rats, CVT-3619 increased whole-body glucose clearance with no change in fatty acid kinetics. Likewise, analysis of cardiac tissue metabolism showed that CVT-3619 caused an increased glucose but not fatty acid clearance in HF-fed animals. Results show that the acute administration of CVT-3619 lowers circulating fatty acid levels, leading to improved whole-body and cardiac glucose clearance in a model of diet-induced insulin resistance.

{"title": "The influence of naturally occurring differences in birthweight on ventricular cardiomyocyte number in sheep.", "abstract": "In most species including man, cardiomyocytes cease proliferating soon after birth when they become terminally differentiated. A reduced complement of cardiomyocytes in infancy may adversely impact on the function and adaptive capabilities of the heart in later life. Low birthweight is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in adults, but little is known about its effect on the number of cardiomyocytes. Using naturally occurring differences in birthweight, our aim was to determine the effect of birthweight on cardiomyocyte number in postnatal lambs. At 9 weeks after term birth, when the final number of cardiomyocytes is considered to be established, hearts were collected at necropsy from seven singleton and seven twin lambs. Hearts were perfusion-fixed, and tissue samples were systematically taken from the left ventricle plus intraventricular septum (LV+S) and the right ventricle (RV). The number of cardiomyocyte nuclei was estimated using an unbiased optical disector-fractionator stereological technique, and the total number of cardiomyocytes was determined. Weights of the total heart, LV+S and RV were significantly related to both birthweight and necropsy weight. In the LV+S but not the RV, cardiomyocyte number was significantly and directly related to heart tissue weight, birthweight, and necropsy weight. We conclude that the final number of cardiomyocytes in the LV+S is related to prenatal and early postnatal growth, and is proportionate to the weight of heart tissue. A low cardiomyocyte number in the LV+S following restricted fetal growth may contribute to the increased incidence of heart disease in adults born with low birthweight. Anat Rec, 2009.

High-density DNA microarrays were used to characterize global gene expression changes in whole heart. Fifteen genes were significantly differentially expressed following exposure to MTS. Among these genes, cytochrome P-450 1A1 (Cyp1A1) was upregulated by 12-fold, and Serpine-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1) was downregulated by 1.7-fold. Concomitant increase in Cyp1A1 protein levels and decrease in total and active PAI-1 protein was observed in tissue extracts by Western blot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.

In addition, we observed a significant amount of neovascularization of the explanted constructs. Electron microscopy showed the presence of longitudinally aligned fibers with a large number of gap junctions.

Exposure to ether vapor for 1 min twice a day was used as a stressor. Repetitive stress enhanced the number of circulating parasites and cardiac tissue disorganization, from a moderate to a severe diffuse mononuclear inflammatory process and the presence of amastigote burden in the cardiac fibers. Immunological parameters revealed that repetitive stress triggered a reduced concanavalin A induced splenocyte proliferation in vitro with major effects on the late chronic phase. Serum interleukin-12 concentration decreased in both stressed and infected rats in the early phase of infection although it was higher on 180 days post-infection.

Provided the size of the afterdepolarisation region was greater than around 1 mm, propagating extrasystoles were produced in both 1D and 2D. The number of extrasystoles produced depended on the amplitude, period, and duration of the oscillatory EAD waveform. In 2D, re-entry was also initiated for specific combinations of EAD amplitude, period, and duration, with the afterdepolarisation region acting as a common pathway.

Therefore, we analyzed in a murine model of surgically induced MI the influence of EPO treatment on survival and functional parameters as well as BMC mobilization, homing, and effect on resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs). Human EPO was injected intraperitoneally after ligation of the left anterior descendens (LAD) for 3 days with a total dose of 5000 IU/kg 6 and 30 days after MI, and pressure volume relationships were investigated in vivo.

Homing factors were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and ELISA. EPO-treated animals showed a significant improvement of survival post-MI (62 vs. 36%).

BMC subpopulations (CD31(+), c-kit(+), and Sca-1(+) cells) were mobilized, and homing of Sca-1(+) and CXCR4(+) BMCs toward an SDF-1 gradient into the ischemic myocardium was enhanced. However, there was no beneficial effect on CSCs. We have shown that EPO application after MI shows cardioprotective effects.

{"title": "Superoxide and respiratory coupling in mitochondria of insulin-deficient diabetic rats.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species have been implicated in both diabetic complications and the progression of the underlying diabetic state. However, it is not clear whether mitochondria of diabetic origin are intrinsically altered to generate excess reactive oxygen species independent of the surrounding diabetic milieu. Mitochondria were isolated from gastrocnemius, heart, and liver of 2-wk and 2-month streptozotocin diabetic rats and controls. We rigidly quantified mitochondrial superoxide, respiration and ATP production, respiratory coupling, the expression of several proteins with antioxidant properties, and the redox state of glutathione. Both fluorescent assessment and electron paramagnetic spectroscopy revealed that superoxide production was unchanged or reduced in the 2-month diabetic mitochondria compared with controls. Kinetic analysis of the proton leak showed that diabetic heart and muscle mitochondria were actually more coupled compared with control despite an approximate 2- to 4-fold increase in uncoupling protein-3 content. Adenine nucleotide translocator type 1 expression was reduced by approximately 50% in diabetic muscle mitochondria. Catalase was significantly up-regulated in muscle and heart tissue and in heart mitochondria, whereas glutathione peroxidase expression was increased in liver mitochondria of diabetic rats. We conclude that gastrocnemius, heart, and liver mitochondria of streptozotocin diabetic rats are not irrevocably altered toward excess superoxide production either by complex I or complex III. Moreover, gastrocnemius and heart mitochondria demonstrate increased, not decreased, respiratory coupling. Mitochondria of insulin-deficient diabetic rats do show signs of adaptation to antecedent oxidative stress manifested as tissue-specific enzyme and uncoupling protein expression but remain remarkably robust with respect to superoxide production.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2008-09-06", "authors": ["Judith AHerlein", "Brian DFink", "YunxiaO'Malley", "William ISivitz"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2008-0404"}

Growth is regarded as a deformation that is decomposed into a plastic component which describes unconstrained growth and an elastic component to satisfy continuity of the tissue after growth. In current growth models, a single reference configuration is used that remains fixed throughout the entire growth process. However, considering continuous turnover to occur together with growth, such a fixed reference is unlikely to exist in reality. Therefore, we investigated the effect of tissue turnover on growth by incrementally updating the reference configuration. With both a fixed reference and an updated reference, strain-induced cardiac growth in magnitude of 30% could be simulated. However, with an updated reference, the amplitude of the stimulus for growth decreased over time, whereas with a fixed reference this amplitude increased. We conclude that, when modeling volumetric growth, the choice of the reference configuration is of great importance for the computed growth.", "journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "date": "2008-09-02", "authors": ["WilcoKroon", "TammoDelhaas", "TheoArts", "PeterBovendeerd"], "doi": "10.1007/s10237-008-0136-z"}

We investigated the prognostic value of this cardiac tissue in short-term patient mortality. Previous studies have shown that the degree of cardiac fibrosis correlates with improvements in ejection fraction and the likelihood of weaning from an assist device.\nLeft ventricular apical core tissues from 29 sequential subjects who received a HeartMate II continuous axial flow left ventricular assist device were studied retrospectively to determine whether interstitial fibrosis, replacement fibrosis (scar), the presence of mural thrombus, or other histopathologic findings were associated with hemodynamic changes or mortality in this population. Patients received left ventricular assist devices as bridges to transplantation or as destination therapy. Interstitial fibrosis was determined by observer scoring and digital scoring methods. Before and after left ventricular assist device procedure, right heart catheterizations were reviewed for clinical cardiac data.\nThe presence of replacement fibrosis in the apical core tissue significantly correlated with decreased improvement in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure after left ventricular assist device placement (P=.02). Ten subjects died over the course of this study. No specimen variables, including scar, interstitial fibrosis, and the presence of mural thrombosis, correlated with patient mortality.\nPathologic findings in left ventricular apical cores have little prognostic utility in guiding patient management as related to overall 1-year mortality, but may indicate patients who are more likely to positively remodel their hearts.", "journal": "Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology", "date": "2008-08-19", "authors": ["Karl ASoderlund", "Raghu RChivukula", "Stuart DRussell", "John VConte", "James OMudd", "Marc KHalushka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.carpath.2008.06.007"}

Recently developed strain and strain rate imaging provide the unique opportunity to assess tissue deformation in all planes of motion.\nNineteen runners (mean+/-SD age; 41+/-9 years) were assessed prior to and within 60 min (34+/-10 min) of race finish (Comrades Marathon, 89 km). Standard echocardiography assessed ejection fraction and the ratio of early to atrial (E/A) peak transmitral blood flow velocities. Myocardial speckle tracking determined segmental strain as well as systolic and diastolic strain rates in radial, circumferential, and longitudinal planes. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) assessed cardiomyocyte insult. Ejection fraction (71+/-5 to 64+/-6%) and E/A (1.47+/-0.35 to 1.25+/-0.30) were reduced (P<0.05). Peak strain and peak systolic and diastolic strain rates were altered post-race in circumferential (e.g. peak strain reduced from 21.3+/-2.4 to 17.3+/-3.2%, P<0.05) and radial planes. Some individual heterogeneity was observed between segments and planes of motion. A post-race elevation in cTnT (range 0.013-0.272 microg/L) in 5/12 runners did not differentiate changes in LV function.\nCompletion of the Comrades Marathon resulted in a depression in ejection fraction, E/A, as well as radial and circumferential strain and strain rates.

Inflammatory mediators or cytokines are released following myocardial infarction and ischemia/reperfusion injury. These cytokines, of which interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are among the most important, propagate the activation of a multitude of signaling pathways, such as the protein kinase C (PKC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathways, which lead to deleterious changes in the structure and function of the coronary microvascular endothelium.\nThe effects of cytokines on rat heart microvascular endothelial cell monolayer integrity, PKC activity, and adherens junction protein alteration were examined. Further, an in vivo rat coronary ischemia/reperfusion injury model was used to determine vascular leakage and TNF-alpha release.\nAdministration of the above mentioned cytokines to cell monolayers resulted in significant increases in PKC activation, gap formation, and hyperpermeability across the monolayer and beta-catenin phosphorylation/reorganization. Inhibition of conventional PKC and MLCK attenuated permeability increases. Ischemia/reperfusion injury to the left ventricle resulted in TNF-alpha release as well as conventional PKC- and MLCK-dependent protein extravasation from the circulation to the heart tissue.\nThese results identify the conventional PKC and MLCK pathways as important factors in coronary endothelial dysfunction elicited by IR injury and cytokine release.

Phenolic acids are widespread in plant foods; they contain important biological and pharmacological properties. This study evaluated the role of phenolic acids on the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the heart of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Gallic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid at a dosage of 100 mg kg(-1) body weight significantly increased the activities of cardiac superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) as compared with control rats (P<.05). The changes in cardiac CuZnSOD, GPx and CAT mRNA levels induced by phenolic acids were similar to those noted in the enzyme activity levels. A significant (P<.05) increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio was observed in the heart of phenolic acid-treated rats. The heart homogenates obtained from rats that were administered phenolic acids displayed significant (P<.05) increases in capacity for oxygen radical absorbance compared with control rats. Immunoblot analysis revealed the increased cardiac total level of Nrf2 in phenolic acid-treated rats.

A novel mechanism for this cardioprotection may include paracrine actions. Our lab has recently shown that gender differences exist in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) paracrine function. Estrogen is implicated in the cardioprotection found in females. It remains unknown whether 17beta-estradiol (E2) affects MSC paracrine function and whether E2-treated MSCs may better protect injured cardiac tissue. We hypothesize that E2-exposed MSCs infused into hearts prior to ischemia may demonstrate increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and greater protection of myocardial function compared to untreated MSCs.\nUntreated and E2-treated MSCs were isolated, cultured, and plated and supernatants were harvested for VEGF assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rat hearts (n = 13) were isolated and perfused via Langendorff model and subjected to 15 min equilibration, 25 min warm global ischemia, and 40 min reperfusion. Hearts were randomly assigned to perfusate vehicle, untreated male MSC, or E2-treated male MSC. Transcoronary delivery of 1 million MSCs was performed immediately prior to ischemia in experimental hearts.\nE2-treated MSCs provoked significantly more VEGF production than untreated MSCs (933.2 +/- 64.9 versus 595.8 +/- 10.7 pg/mL). Postischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was significantly greater in hearts infused with E2-treated MSCs (66.9 +/- 3.3%) than untreated MSCs (48.7 +/- 3.7%) and vehicle (28.9 +/- 4.6%) at end reperfusion. There was also greater recovery of the end diastolic pressure with E2-treated MSCs than untreated MSCs and vehicle.\nPreischemic infusion of MSCs protects myocardial function and viability.

We hypothesized that human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) assessed with a combination of single cell electrophysiology and microelectrode array (MEA) mapping can serve as a novel model for electrophysiological drug screening. Current-clamp studies revealed that E-4031 and Sotalol (IKr blockers) significantly increased hESC-CM's action potential duration and also induced after-depolarizations (the in vitro correlates of increased arrhythmogenic potential). Multicellular aggregates of hESC-CMs were then analyzed with the MEA technique. Application of class I (Quinidine, Procaineamide) and class III (Sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, E-4031, and Cisapride (a noncardiogenic agent known to lengthen QT) resulted in dose-dependent prolongation of the corrected field potential duration (cFPD). We next utilized the MEA technique to also assess pharmacological effects on conduction. Activation maps demonstrated significant conduction slowing following administration of Na channel blockers (Quinidine and Propafenone) and of the gap junction blocker (1-heptanol).

We hypothesized that cultivation of cardiomyocytes (CM) on preformed networks of fibroblasts (FB) and endothelial cells (EC) would enhance the structural and functional properties of the organoids, compared to simultaneously seeding the three cell types or cultivating enriched CM alone. Microchannels for cell seeding were created by photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate. In the preculture group the channels were seeded with a mixture of NIH 3T3 FB and D4T EC, following by addition of neonatal rat CM after 2 days of FB/EC preculture. The control microchannels were seeded simultaneously with FB/EC/CM (simultaneous triculture) or with enriched CM alone (enriched CM). Preculture resulted in cylindrical, contractile, and compact cardiac organoids that contained elongated CM expressing connexin-43 and cardiac troponin I. In contrast, simultaneous triculture resulted in noncontractile organoids with clusters of CM growing separately from elongated FBs and ECs. The staining for Connexin-43 was absent in the simultaneous triculture group. When fixed or frozen FB/EC were utilized as a preculture substrate for CM, noncontractile organoids were obtained; while preculture on a single cell type (either FB or EC) resulted in contractile organoids but with inferior properties compared to preculture with both FB/EC.
