With immobilised antibody and HSA in solution, the kinetic association rate constant k(a) was 18 100 l mol(-1) s(-1) and the dissociation constant k(d) was 0.00369 s(-1). For the opposite arrangement (immobilised HSA), a slower dissociation was observed, k(d) was 0.00085 s(-1). A competitive assay for HSA was developed with working range of 1-5 mug ml(-1) and a total time for one analysis equal to 17 min. Samples of urine were analysed after tenfold dilution.

{"title": "Monitoring of DNA oxidative damage with piezoelectric quartz crystal method.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) sensor was used to detect the whole process of DNA damage oxidized by H(2)O(2) system containing Cu(2+) or Zn(2+) based on the density-viscosity change of the detected solution. The PQC impedance method has been applied to further investigate the damage process of DNA oxidized by H(2)O(2) system containing Cu(2+). It was found that the ratio of DeltaR(1) to Deltaf(0) or DeltaL(1) coincided well with that calculated from Martin's equations reflecting the solution density-viscosity effect, suggesting that the continuing change in liquid loading on to the PQC surface caused the significant variation of Deltaf(0), DeltaR(1) and DeltaL(1). It has also been found that the H(2)O(2) system containing Cu(2+) could oxidize DNA more completely than that containing Zn(2+), and a trace Cu(2+) in the system could cause DNA damage. However, no significant breakage in the DNA backbone was observed if the system contained only H(2)O(2). The DNA concentration was linearly related to Deltaf(0s), which is the different between the initial frequency and the frequency after a reaction time of 45 min, in the range of 50-1000 mug ml(-1). The effect of H(2)O(2) or Cu(2+) concentration of was also investigated.

In addition, peptide recovery from PVDF membranes is higher than from nitrocellulose, particularly from higher-retention PVDF (e.g., ProBlott, Transblot, Westran, or Immobilon P(sp)).

{"title": "Advances in ultrasound.", "abstract": "Significant advances have been recently introduced into various fields of technology, taking advantage of the use of new piezoelectric materials and the large diffusion of broadband transducers. Various types of modulation may be applied to the pulse characteristics, using single pulse, multipulse or multiline techniques, and resulting in improved spatial resolution and better penetration. Non-linear imaging uses the harmonics component, which is generated by tissues or by contrast agents. Different modalities can be used to separate harmonics from fundamental bands from the received signal. New Doppler modes have been developed, whereas grey-scale flow imaging allows the simultaneous imaging of blood flow and tissues. Compounding techniques improve the contrast resolution of tissues and reduce artefacts. If 3D techniques are now currently available, real-time 4D imaging has been recently introduced. Elastographic imaging is still under evaluation, but promising clinical results have been shown. Recent release of the DICOM specification has made the full integration of ultrasound to the PACS systems easier.

{"title": "Optical phase contrast measurement of ultrasonic fields.", "abstract": "This report describes an optical phase contrast imaging technique for the measurement of wide bandwidth ultrasound fields in water. In this method, a collimated optical wavefront (lambda(l) = 810 nm) impinges on a wide bandwidth ultrasound pulse. The method requires that refractive index perturbations induced by the ultrasound field be sufficiently small. Specifically, on exit from the acoustic field, the phase of the optical wavefront must be proportional to the ray sum of local density taken in the direction of propagation of the incident optical wave. A similar restriction is placed on the dimensions of the ultrasound pulse. Repeated measurement of this phase as the ultrasound field is rotated through 180 degrees about an axis normal to the direction of propagation of the incident optical wave generates the Radon transform of the ultrasonically induced refractive index perturbation. Standard tomographic reconstruction techniques are used to reconstruct the full three-dimensional refractive index perturbation. A simple two-lens imaging system and an optical signal processing element from phase contrast microscopy provide a method of directly measuring an affine function of the desired optical phase for small optical phase shifts. The piezo- and elasto-optic coefficients (the first partial derivatives of refractive index with respect to density and pressure) relate refractive index to density and pressure via a linear model. The optical measurement method described in this paper provides a direct, quantitative measurement of the piezo- and elasto-optic coefficients (from the density or pressure fields).", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-01-22", "authors": ["T APitts", "ASagers", "J FGreenleaf"], "doi": "10.1109/58.971722"}
{"title": "Phase-matched air ultrasonic transducers using corrugated PVDF film with half wavelength depth.", "abstract": "A new type of large area PVDF film air transducer is proposed. The transducer features a high power output and a sharp beam angle. Conventionally known curved length mode resonators with two clamps at both ends have a resonance frequency determined by the curvature. In the present work, PVDF was formed into alternating concave and convex multiple curved sections, eliminating clamps, i.e., a periodic corrugation structure using a single PVDF film. Each convex and concave section has a common resonance frequency. A common excitation voltage induces vibration for each section, and the vibration direction is normal to the film surface. The vibration phase of convex section is shifted 180 degrees from the concave section. These waves add constructively to form a strong acoustic beam when corrugation height is approximately one-half of the wavelength. The corrugation height controls propagation path difference, canceling excitation phase difference. The design principle based on a uniform vibration mode is presented. Experimental investigations using 8.8 x 2.5-, 10 x 5-, and 20 x 20-cm2 transducers are presented. Side lobes unique to this corrugation structure have been observed. A theoretical analysis of the side lobes is also presented. According to the theory, choosing the corrugation height appropriately will reduce side lobes to -15 dB with regard to the main lobe, and the observed side lobe height agreed with the theoretical result.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2002-01-22", "authors": ["MToda"], "doi": "10.1109/58.971708"}

This complication can occur during the osteotomy, which is performed with burs, or during the elevation of the membrane using manual elevators. The purpose of this article is to present a new surgical technique that radically simplifies maxillary sinus surgery, thus avoiding perforating the membrane. The piezoelectric bony window osteotomy easily cuts mineralized tissue without damaging the soft tissue, and the piezoelectric sinus membrane elevation separates the schneiderian membrane without causing perforations. The elevation of the membrane from the sinus floor is performed using both piezoelectric elevators and the force of a physiologic solution subjected to piezoelectric cavitation. Twenty-one piezoelectric bony window osteotomy and piezoelectric sinus membrane elevations were performed on 15 patients using the appropriate surgical device (Mectron Piezosurgery System). Only one perforation occurred during the osteotomy at the site of an underwood septa, resulting in a 95% success rate. The average length of the window was 14 mm; its height was 6 mm, and its thickness was 1.4 mm. The average time necessary for the piezoelectric bony window osteotomy was approximately 3 minutes, while the piezoelectric sinus membrane elevation required approximately 5 minutes.", "journal": "The International journal of periodontics & restorative dentistry", "date": "2002-01-17", "authors": ["TVercellotti", "SDe Paoli", "MNevins"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Measurement of the dynamics of exocytosis and vesicle retrieval at cell populations using a quartz crystal microbalance.", "abstract": "The quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation technique (QCM-D) is used in two different measurement strategies to monitor the mass change and rigidity of populations of excitable cells during exocytosis and subsequent retrieval of dense-core vesicles. Two cell lines, NG 108-15 and PC 12, were grown to confluence on piezoelectric quartz crystals and were examined separately to demonstrate differences in release and retrieval with cells of different morphology, size, and number of dense-core vesicles. Stimulating the cells to exocytosis with media containing an elevated potassium concentration resulted in an increase in the frequency response corresponding to loss of mass from the cells owing to release of vesicles. In Ca2+-free media, the response was completely abolished. The amplitude and peak area in the frequency response corresponding to mass change with stimulated release was larger for PC 12 cells than for NG 108-15 cells, whereas the initial rate constants for the frequency responses were similar. The data suggest (1) that a greater number and larger size of vesicles in PC 12 cells results in a greater amount of release from these cells vs NG 108-15 cells, (2) the recycling of vesicles utilizes similar fusion/retrieval mechanisms in both cell types, (3) that the control of excess retrieval might be related to the number and size of released vesicles, and (4) that measured retrieval has a rapid onset, masking exocytosis and implying a rapid retrieval mechanism in the early stages of release.

Filtration experiments were performed using 0.22 microm hydrophobic and hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes in a stirred-cell system on the NOM isolated from three Australian surface waters. As expected, the fouling rate for the hydrophobic membrane was considerably greater than for the hydrophilic membrane. Focusing on the hydrophobic membrane, it was shown that the high molecular weight fraction of NOM ( > 30 kDa) was responsible for the major flux decline. Filtration tests on the four fractions of NOM isolated on the basis of hydrophobicity and charge using non-functionalised and anionic resins revealed that the fouling potential for the three waters was hydrophilic neutral > hydrophobic acids > transphilic acids > hydrophilic charged. The low-aromatic hydrophilic neutral compounds were the main determinant of the rate and extent of flux decline. This was linked to the colloidal size fraction ( > 30 kDa) and to the selective concentration of calcium in the fraction leading to organics-Ca2+ bridging. It was also shown that the higher the aromaticity of the NOM the greater the flux decline, and the aromatics mainly resided in the hydrophobic acids fraction. Overall, the fouling mechanism controlling the flux decline involved the combined effects of adsorptive and colloidal fouling by the hydrophilic neutral fraction in the internal pore structure of the membrane.", "journal": "Water research", "date": "2002-01-05", "authors": ["LFan", "J LHarris", "F ARoddick", "N ABooker"], "doi": "10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00183-x"}

{"title": "Development and evaluation of an ultrasonic ground water seepage meter.", "abstract": "Submarine ground water discharge can influence significantly the near-shore transport and flux of chemicals into the oceans. Quantification of the sources and rates of such discharge requires a ground water seepage meter that provides continuous measurements at high resolution over an extended period of time. An ultrasonic flowmeter has been adapted for such measurements in the submarine environment. Connected to a steel collection funnel, the meter houses two piezoelectric transducers mounted at opposite ends of a cylindrical flow tube. By monitoring the perturbations of fluid flow on the propagation of sound waves inside the flow tube, the ultrasonic meter can measure both forward and reverse fluid flows in real time. Laboratory and field calibrations show that the ultrasonic meter can resolve ground water discharges on the order of 0.1 microm/sec, and it is sufficiently robust for deployment in the field for several days. Data from West Neck Bay, Shelter Island, New York, elucidate the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of submarine ground water discharge and its interplay with tidal loading. A negative correlation between the discharge and tidal elevation was generally observed. A methodology was also developed whereby data for the sound velocity as a function of temperature can be used to infer the salinity and source of the submarine discharge. Independent measurements of electrical conductance were performed to validate this methodology.", "journal": "Ground water", "date": "2001-11-16", "authors": ["R JPaulsen", "C FSmith", "DO'Rourke", "T FWong"], "doi": "10.1111/j.1745-6584.2001.tb02478.x"}
{"title": "A comparative study on the viscoelasticity and morphology of polyaniline films galvanostatically grown on bare and 4-aminothiophenol-modified gold electrodes using an electrochemical quartz crystal impedance system and SEM.", "abstract": "The equivalent-circuit parameters of the 9-MHz piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC) resonance were measured in situ during the galvanostatic polymerization of aniline on 4-aminothiophenol(4-ATP)-modified and bare Au electrodes for ca. 2000 s, respectively. Two polymerization media, 0.100 mol L-1 aniline in 1.0 mol L-1 H2SO4 and in 2.0 mol L-1 HClO4 aqueous solutions, and two values of the current density, 12 and 36 microA cm-2, were used. At identical levels of the resonant frequency shifts in the solutions, obviously greater increases in the motional resistance (R1) were found after aniline polymerization on bare Au electrodes, though the absolute values of delta f0/delta R1 were all large; also, the resonant frequency shifts in air (delta f0g) were considerably smaller for PANI films grown on bare Au electrodes. It is thus concluded that, under identical polymerization conditions, (1) the PANI film grown on a bare gold electrode is rougher, less compact, and can entrap solution more notably; (2) the deposition efficiency of PANI is higher on a 4-ATP-modified Au electrode, owing to a significantly greater observed \"dry\" frequency shift, and thus a greater \"net\" mass value of the polyaniline backbone. SEM observations have confirmed that PANI films on 4-ATP-modified Au electrodes were smoother and more compact than those grown on bare Au ones under identical polymerization conditions. In addition, a technique of simultaneous measurements of the electroacoustic admittance of the PQC resonance and the electrochemical impedance was used to monitor the adsorption of 4-ATP onto a PQC gold electrode.", "journal": "Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry", "date": "2001-11-16", "authors": ["QXie", "YZhang", "CXiang", "JTang", "YLi", "QZhao", "SYao"], "doi": "10.2116/analsci.17.613"}

Immunization with the purified protein induced infertility in male and female rats. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent studies have demonstrated that the antigen is specific to spermatozoa. The present study describes the partial amino acid sequencing of 80-kDa HSA. The homogeneous protein was electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDF membrane and the excised band of 80-kDa HSA was used to determine the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence. The protein was then subjected to enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C and endoproteinase Glu-C. The partial amino acid sequence of the major peptides thus obtained was determined. The digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C generated 4 major peptides, two of which showed partial sequence homology with lactoferrin. Endoproteinase Glu-C digestion produced 3 major peptides. The sequences of the 2 peptides were determined for which no matches were found in the databank. These results confirmed earlier observations that 80-kDa HSA is a sperm-specific protein that is chemically distinct from any other protein involved in normal physiological process.

{"title": "Study of the technological parameters of ultrasonic nebulization.", "abstract": "The principle of an ultrasonic nebulizer is based on the vibrations of a piezoelectric crystal driven by an alternating electrical field. These periodic vibrations are characterized by their frequency, their amplitude, and their intensity, which corresponds to the energy transmitted per surface unit. When the vibration in tensity is sufficient, cavitation occurs, and droplets are generated. Ventilation enables airflow to cross the nebulizer and to expel the aerosol droplets. For a given nebulizer, the vibration frequency of the piezoelectric crystal is fixed, often in the range 1-2.5MHz. In most cases, an adjustment in vibration intensity is possible by modifying vibration amplitude. The ventilation level is adjustable. The vibrations may be transmitted through a coupling liquid--commonly water--to a nebulizer cup containing the solution to be aerosolized. In this work, we studied the influence of the technological parameters of ultrasonic nebulization on nebulization quality. Our study was carried out with a 9% sodium chloride solution and a 2% protein solution (alpha1 protease inhibitor). Three different ultrasonic nebulizers were used. An increase in vibration frequency decreased the size of droplets emitted. The coupling liquid absorbed the energy produced by the ultrasonic vibrations and canceled out any heating of the solution, which is particularly interesting for thermosensitive drugs. An increase in vibration intensity did not modify the size of droplets emitted, but decreased nebulization time and raised the quantity of protein nebulized, thus improving performance. On the other hand, an increase in ventilation increased the size of emitted droplets and decreased nebulization time and the quantity of protein nebulized because more drug was lost on the walls of the nebulizer. High intensity associated with low ventilation favors drug delivery deep into the lungs.", "journal": "Drug development and industrial pharmacy", "date": "2001-11-06", "authors": ["M PFlament", "PLeterme", "AGayot"], "doi": "10.1081/ddc-100107320"}

{"title": "A quartz crystal microbalance cell biosensor: detection of microtubule alterations in living cells at nM nocodazole concentrations.", "abstract": "The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to create a piezoelectric biosensor utilizing living endothelial cells (ECs) as the biological signal transduction element. ECs adhere to the hydrophilically treated gold QCM surface under growth media containing serum. At 24 h following cell addition, calibration curves were constructed relating the steady state Deltaf and DeltaR shift values observed to the numbers of electronically counted cells requiring trypsinization to be removed from the surface. We then utilized this EC QCM biosensor for the detection of the effect of [nocodazole] on the steady state Deltaf and DeltaR shift values. Nocodazole, a known microtubule binding drug, alters the cytoskeletal properties of living cells. At the doses used in these studies (0.11-15 microM), nocodazole, in a dose dependent fashion, causes the depolymerization of microtubules in living cells. This leads a monolayer of well spread ECs to gradually occupy a smaller area, lose cell to cell contact, exhibit actin stress fibers at the cell periphery and acquire a rounded cell shape. We observed the negative Deltaf shift values and the positive DeltaR shift values to increase significantly in magnitude over a 4-h incubation period following nocodazole addition, in a dose dependent fashion, with a transition midpoint of 900 nM. Fluorescence microscopy of the ECs, fixed on the gold QCM surface and stained for actin, demonstrated that the shape and cytoskeleton of ECs were affected by as little as 330 nM nocodazole. These results indicate that the EC QCM biosensor can be used for the study of EC attachment and to detect EC cytoskeletal alterations. We suggest the potential of this cellular biosensor for the real time identification or screening of all classes of biologically active drugs or biological macromolecules that affect cellular attachment, regardless of their molecular mechanism of action.", "journal": "Biosensors & bioelectronics", "date": "2001-10-27", "authors": ["K AMarx", "TZhou", "AMontrone", "HSchulze", "S JBraunhut"], "doi": "10.1016/s0956-5663(01)00219-6"}

The slower diffusion is monitored by means of cyclic voltammetry. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this assay format, recognition of biotin by streptavidin has been chosen as a model system. Labelling of biotin was achieved by covalent binding of a ferrocene derivative to the biotin unit. To reduce the consumption of expensive compounds and to allow automatisation of the assay a novel miniaturised set-up was developed based on a wall-free sample droplet which forms the electrochemical cell with typical volumes of up to 10 microl. This droplet is dispensed by means of a step-motor driven syringe pump through a specially designed electrode holder spanning the gap between a micro-working electrode and a macroscopic counter electrode. By means of a piezo-driven micro-dispenser a predefined number of nano-droplets (100 pl volume each) containing the redox-labelled hapten are shot into the sample droplet. By this, any physical contact and hence any cross-contamination between the sample and the reagent solution could be avoided.

{"title": "Human sperm aster formation and pronuclear decondensation in bovine eggs following intracytoplasmic sperm injection using a Piezo-driven pipette: a novel assay for human sperm centrosomal function.", "abstract": "In human fertilization, the sperm introduces the centrosome; the microtubule-organizing center and microtubules are organized within the inseminated egg from the sperm centrosome. These microtubules form a radial array, called the sperm aster, the functioning of which is essential to pronuclear movement for union of male and female genome. The sperm centrosomal function is considered to be necessary for the normal human fertilization process. Therefore, the dysfunction of sperm centrosome is a possible cause of human fertilization failure. However, little information is available regarding human sperm centrosomal function during fertilization in clinically assisted reproductive technology. To assess the human sperm centrosomal function, we examined sperm aster formation and pronuclear decondensation following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with human sperm into the bovine egg using a Piezo-driven pipette and ethanol activation of eggs. After human sperm incorporation into bovine egg, we observed that the sperm aster was organized from sperm centrosome, and that the sperm aster was enlarged as the sperm nuclei underwent pronuclear formation. The sperm aster formation rate at 6 h post-ICSI and the male pronuclear formation rate at 8-12 h post-ICSI were 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. No difference of the sperm aster formation rate and the male pronuclear formation rate was observed between eggs activated with ethanol and eggs without artificial activation. We concluded that this heterologous Piezo-ICSI system into bovine egg can be a novel assay for human sperm centrosomal function, and it is possible to explicate a course of fertilization failure that was unknown until now.", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "date": "2001-10-24", "authors": ["SNakamura", "YTerada", "THoriuchi", "CEmuta", "TMurakami", "NYaegashi", "KOkamura"], "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod65.5.1359"}

Such a motility can be explained by an \"area motor\" model, which assumes two states in the motor and that conformational transitions involve transfer of motor charge across the membrane and mechanical displacements of the membrane. Here it is shown that the area motor is piezoelectric and that the hair cell that incorporates such a motor in its lateral membrane is also piezoelectric.

The focus of this report is the 0.22 micron Durapore (hydrophilic modified PVDF) filter which is used throughout our recovery processes. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify potential filter extractables from the hydrophilic PVDF filters; (2) to show that NMR spectroscopy may be used to detect filter extractables in the presence of product and excipients; and (3) to establish levels of filter extractables obtained by extraction with a variety of buffers. The data show that the primary source of filter extractables is the hydrophilic modification of the PVDF membrane surface. Extractables from the modified hydrophilic PVDF filter include propylene glycol (PG) and soluble oligomers of the hydroxypropyl acrylate and cross-linker. Propylene glycol, arising from the hydrolysis of the hydroxypropyl acrylate, appears to be the primary extractable in buffers above pH 11. Since the 1H-NMR method can easily detect the methyl proton signals of PG, an NMR assay was developed to detect PG in the presence of buffer excipients and final product. Propylene glycol can be used as a marker for the extractables from Durapore hydrophilic PVDF filters. Although numerous buffers were used to generate extractables from the PVDF filter, significant extractables (PG and soluble oligomers) were found only in high pH extraction buffers. As a result of this finding, only a limited number of new buffers or new PVDF filters will require testing for future validation studies.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate ESWL in patients with such calculi.\nFrom November 1990 to November 1999, all patients with sialolithiasis of the parotid gland were treated with piezoelectric ESWL. Three different lithotriptors were used over the 9-year study period. Results were analyzed according to both the patients' clinical status and follow-up sonograms.\nIn total, 42 patients (21 women, 21 men; mean age, 59 years) were treated with ESWL. The mean follow-up period for all patients was 63 months (range, 7-96 months). After ESWL had been performed, 71% of the patients were completely free of symptoms, and 21% had marked improvement of their symptoms. Sixty-seven percent were completely free of calculi, and 27% had a marked reduction in the size of their calculi.

Several studies have shown that the frequency of this tremor is reduced in patients whose consciousness is reduced by anaesthesia or head injury. Therefore, OMT may possibly be used to determine depth of anaesthesia. Twenty-two unpre-medicated subjects undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia were studied. OMT activity was measured at admission using the open eye piezoelectric strain gauge technique. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol using a target controlled infusion delivery system (Diprifusor). OMT activity was then recorded at predicted plasma propofol concentrations of 1, 2, 3 and 5 microg ml(-1). The patient's level of consciousness (response to command or stimulation) was assessed after each OMT measurement. OMT activity was reduced progressively at predicted plasma concentrations of propofol of I and 2 microg ml(-1) and then plateaued between 3 and 5 microg ml(-1). There was a significant difference between the last awake OMT recording and the first recording at loss of consciousness (P < 0.001).

Two-dimensional motion equations for predicting the frequency changes are derived from three-dimensional piezoelectricity equations, and equations deduced by Janiaud for solving the stress distribution in crystal plates are used to calculate the force-frequency coefficients of incomplete circular resonators. The results show that the piezoelectric effect of crystal plates decreases the force-frequency coefficient of the azimuth angle 0 degrees by 7% as compared with no piezoelectricity assumption. The incomplete circular shape can be applied to a larger load than the circular disc because the flat regions of the incomplete shape provide a distributed load application without the problems of stress concentration of a point force inherent to a circular disc. The incomplete shape gives an increased force sensitivity when compared with the complete disc near azimuth angle 0 degrees.

{"title": "A unified formalism using effective surface permittivity to study acoustic waves in various anisotropic and piezoelectric multilayers.", "abstract": "A unified formalism is presented that uses the effective surface permittivity (ESP) to study surface acoustic waves (SAW) in layered substrates and guided waves in layered plates. Based on known mathematical tools, such as ordinary differential equation and transfer matrix, a generalized surface impedance (GSI) concept is developed and exploited to investigate the acoustic propagation in various anisotropic and piezoelectric layered structures. The ESP function, originally defined for the surface of a homogeneous and semi-infinite piezoelectric substrate, is extended to both the top surface of and an interface in a layered half space, as well as to either surface of a finite-thickness plate. General ESP expressions for all mentioned configurations are derived in terms of an equivalent GSI matrix. It is shown that, when using the appropriate GSI matrices, the same form of the ESP expressions applies no matter whether the structure is a homogeneous half space alone or coated with a layered plate or a layered plate alone. GSI matrices are explicitly given in terms of the bulk partial mode solutions for a substrate and via the transfer matrix for a plate. Modified GSI matrices for structures consisting of both a plate and a substrate are also specified. Analytical development is fully detailed to suit program implementation. To illustrate its versatility, the formalism is also applied to two-substrate configurations, allowing one to analyze guided waves in a plate sandwiched between and interfacial waves existing along the boundary of two different media. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the spectrum features that the ESP shows for various structures. Deduced ESP expressions allow one to locate directly all piezoelectrically active waves in any structure including at least one piezoelectric layer. Acoustic modes that are not piezoelectrically active and those in non-piezoelectric materials can be also obtained by using the intermediate results, such as derived GSI matrices.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2001-09-26", "authors": ["V YZhang", "J ELefebvre", "CBruneel", "TGryba"], "doi": "10.1109/58.949756"}

An understanding of the fundamental nature of acceleration sensitivity in crystal oscillators resides primarily in understanding the behavior of the crystal resonator. The driving factor behind the acceleration-induced frequency shift is shown to be deformation of the resonator. The deformation drives two effects: an essentially linear change in the frequency-determining dimensions of the resonator and an essentially nonlinear effect of changing the velocity of the propagating wave. In this paper, the fundamental nature of acceleration sensitivity is reviewed and clarified, and attendant design guidance is developed for piezoelectric resonators. The basic properties of acceleration sensitivity and general design guidance are developed through the simple examples of \"bulk acoustic wave (BAW) in a box\" and \"surface transverse wave (STW) in a box.\" These examples serve to clarify a number of concepts, including the role of mode shape and the basic difference between the BAW and STW cases.

But, until now, the status of surface waves on piezoelectric materials has remained unresolved. This paper presents general existence theorems for surface waves on piezoelectric substrates. It is demonstrated that for short circuit boundary conditions a surface wave solution must exist under virtually any circumstances. However, for a free surface, comparatively stringent existence conditions are required. Numerical examples are given for both free and shorted surfaces, and it is demonstrated that, in some situations, a surface wave solution may not exist for free surface propagation. The existence proofs were developed as a result of theoretical work on Green function modeling, which is now the preferred technique for rigorous SAW and pseudo-SAW device analysis.

For that reason, the analysis of periodic structures on a semi-infinite piezoelectric substrate is one of the most important problems being investigated by SAW researchers. For infinite periodic grating modeling, we developed numerical mixed FEM/BEM (finite element method-boundary element method) models using an efficient interpolation basis function that takes into account the singularity at both edges of each electrode. In this paper, a review of the numerical program that has been developed during the past few years will be presented. For an infinite periodic grating, it is convenient to solve the propagation problem in the Fourier domain (wave number space and harmonic excitation), and important efforts have been spent to properly integrate the so-called periodic harmonic Green function. Using this numerical model together with the general P- matrix formalism, it is possible to compute all of the basic parameters with a very good accuracy.

Here, we propose a new approach to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The method can be used to determine whether protein tyrosine phosphorylations and dephosphorylations occur in the cytosol or the nucleus and to ascertain whether such modifications are associated with nuclear traffic. Promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells are used as the experimental model. Biotinylated cytosolic proteins from donor cells are used to trace nuclear transport in permeabilized recipient cells. Thereafter, 2-D gel electrophoresis is applied to fractionate the cytosolic and nuclear proteins of the recipient cells, which are subsequently blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes are developed with streptavidin and then reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The major advantages of the protocol are that it is simple to perform, and reproducible results are obtained by overlaying the patterns of biotinylated and/or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Moreover, several hundred cytosolic and nuclear proteins can be analyzed in parallel.

{"title": "Temporal organization of multi-whisker contact in rats.", "abstract": "Previous work has established that during exploration and discrimination, rats move their whiskers at frequencies between 6 and 12 Hz and that whisking frequency changes during contact. One critical component of any tactile system is contact. In the rat whisker system, such contacts may involve one or more vibrissa in the whisker array and contact duration of each whisker may vary over a considerable range, depending upon the behavioral context. However, little is known about the variables controlling contact duration or about the temporal relationships among contacts by adjacent whiskers. To address these issues head fixed rats were trained to touch a piezo-contact-sensor with the shaft of their whiskers (Bermejo and Zeigler, Somatosens Mot Res 17: 373-377, 2000). During the task, whisker movements and contacts were monitored with a high-speed camera at 500 frames/s and stored on videotape. To facilitate analysis, animals had their whiskers selectively trimmed. Data are reported from animals with C1 & C2, D1 & D2, or Arc2 (E2, D2, C2, B2) whiskers intact. For both row and arc animals, when just a single whisker touched the sensor the duration of contact was significantly shorter than when multiple whiskers made contact. When multiple whiskers made contact, onset was rarely simultaneous. Furthermore, in row-intact animals, contact progressed in an orderly fashion such that the rostral whisker in a row made contact first followed 24 ms (SE = 1.9 ms) later by the caudal whisker. When contact reversed the caudal whisker lifted off first, followed by the rostral whisker. Thus, the order in which whiskers touch an object regulates contact duration: the first whisker to touch the sensor stays in contact longer than any other whisker. The temporal discharge properties of neurons in the trigeminal system are expected to reflect position of whiskers on the nose.", "journal": "Somatosensory & motor research", "date": "2001-09-06", "authors": ["R NSachdev", "HSellien", "FEbner"], "doi": "10.1080/135578501012006192"}

The back propagation algorithm is used to train the RFNN on-line. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence of tracking error for periodic commands tracking, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine the varied learning rates of the RFNN.

{"title": "Optical resonant ultrasound spectroscopy for fluid properties measurement.", "abstract": "The properties of fluids are studied using unusually small containment spherical resonators. Proper identification of resonant fluid signatures allows determination of pressure and density of the internal gas with great accuracy using an appropriate equation of state (EOS). Low noise and high sensitivity detection of vibration are critical parameters to characterizing the contained gas when its pressure approaches 1 atm or less. The benefits of using spherical resonators to determine fluid properties are discussed, and some example calculations of sound speed are presented. In addition to measuring fluids, a comparative experimental approach is taken to explore and, eventually, to optimize vibration detection. In the experiments, two detection methods, a contact piezoelectric transducer (PZT) device and a non-contact optical device, are compared simultaneously and quantitatively. This is done in a unique manner without change in vibration coupling to the sample between tests. A commercially available resonant ultrasound spectroscopy system is used as the contact system, while another commercial device (used as the non-contact vibration detector) combined with the same excitation source (used in the contact system) comprises the other system. The non-contact detector is an optical interferometric receiver that provides adaptation to optically rough surfaces and high sensitivity to acoustic displacements through optical interference in photorefractive GaAs.

The input and output electrodes are arranged to provide the impedance transformation, which results in the voltage transformation. As they are operated at a resonance, the electrical equivalent circuit approach has traditionally been developed in a rather empirical way and has been used for analysis and design. The present paper deals with the analysis of the piezoelectric transformers based on the three-dimensional finite element modelling. The PIEZO3D code that we have developed is modified to include the external loading conditions. The finite element approach is now available for a wide variety of the electrical boundary conditions. The equivalent circuit of lumped parameters can also be derived from the finite element method (FEM) solution if required. The simulation of the present transformers is made for the low intensity operation and compared with the experimental results. Demonstration is made for basic Rosen-type transformers in which the longitudinal mode of a plate plays an important role; in which the equivalent circuit of lumped constants has been used. However, there are many modes of vibration associated with the plate, the effect of which cannot always be ignored. In the experiment, the double resonances are sometimes observed in the vicinity of the operating frequency. The simulation demonstrates that this is due to the coupling of the longitudinal mode with the flexural mode.

Reversibility is studied for propagation shorter or longer than shock formation distance. In the first case, time-reversal invariance holds and a sinusoid distorted by nonlinearities during forward propagation progressively recovers its initial shape after the time-reversal operation. In the second case, reversibility is broken locally at the shock front as a time-reversal operation transforms a stable compression shock into an unstable expansion shock. Achieving experimentally the time-reversal process with a time-reversal mirror made of reversible piezoelectric transducers for very broadband signals, would require transducers with huge bandwidths. To date, such transducers remain unavailable. In order to overcome this technical limitation, we restricted ourselves in this study to one-dimensional (1D) propagation, for which an experimental ersatz of a time-reversal mirror can be used. Indeed, in a 1D case, the time-reversal operation applied on a plane wave can be mimicked for an antisymmetric wave form by a reflection of the plane wave onto a pressure-release interface.", "journal": "Physical review.

Blanks were prepared under identical conditions, but without the template. Especially, the degree of functionalization (DF) of the PVDF membranes with poly(AMPS-co-MBAA), the membrane permeabilities and non-specific vs. MIP-specific template binding from aqueous solutions during fast filtration were studied in detail to evaluate the effects of the preparation conditions, in particular the coating of the membrane surface with the photoinitiator prior to UV irradiation and the influence of the precoated hydrophilic layer on PVDF. Significant template specificities of the MIP membranes compared with the blanks were only achieved for the preparations including coating the two types of PVDF membranes with BEE. In contrast, a homogeneous photoinitiation of the copolymerisation in the membrane pore volume yielded functional layers with similar DF but with only non-specific desmetryn binding. All data clearly indicate the significant contribution of MIP stabilization by the support material in layers of optimum thickness to the MIP specificity. Main advantages of the novel approach are the potential to synthesize MIP composite membranes by controlled deposition onto any kind of polymer support, and the very fast MIP preparations due to a very efficient photoinitiator and small MIP layer thickness.

Fine-tipped (5 microm in diameter) micropipettes were advanced across the cornea with a piezoelectric micromanipulator, and the IOP was continuously monitored for up to 46 minutes.\nThe micropipette tip was visualized in the anterior chamber. With the SNMS, the IOP of black Swiss outbred mice under ketamine anesthesia was 17.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, higher than values previously estimated in inbred mouse strains by a larger bore microneedle manometric technique. After withdrawal of the micropipette, a second penetration led to a similar level of IOP. Hypotonic solutions increased and hypertonic solutions decreased IOP. Drugs that decrease inflow (acetazolamide, timolol) or increase outflow facility (pilocarpine, latanoprost) in primates and humans lowered steady state IOP in the mouse. The transient initial increase in IOP produced by pilocarpine reported in other animals was also observed in the mouse. Xylazine-ketamine anesthesia lowered IOP substantially in comparison with systemic anesthesia with either ketamine or tribromoethanol alone.\nThe SNMS is the first reliable, reproducible method for measuring mouse IOP. The mouse IOP is sensitive not only to drugs known to reduce aqueous humor inflow but also to drugs that increase aqueous humor outflow facility in the eyes of primates and humans.

The working force was standardised for both ultrasonic instruments at 200 g and for the curette at 500 g.\nThe results revealed that the time needed for instrumentation was 126.1+/-38.2 s for the curette, significantly more than for the piezoelectric ultrasonic instrument (74.1+/-27.6 s; p<0.05) and 104.9+/-25.4 s for the magnetostrictive ultrasonic instrument. Remaining calculus was similar for all three groups. The end Ra values were significantly worse for the piezoelectric instrument (2.02+/-0.41; p<0.05) compared to 1.42+/-0.48 for the curette and 1.36+/-0.41 for the magnetostrictive instrument.

When switched off the actuator impairs the transmission of sound to the ossicular chain at low frequencies, but this effect is only 7 dB at most. The stapes displacements resulting from the action of the implant have a linear relationship with the voltages used to drive the system.

Scanning SHG microscopy and the accompanying third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy of the bulk GaN sample were demonstrated using a femtosecond Cr:forsterite laser at a wavelength of 1230 nm. Taking advantage of the off-resonant electric field-enhanced SHG effect and the bandtail state-resonance THG effect, the second- and third-harmonic generation microscopic images obtained revealed the piezoelectric field and bandtail state distributions in a GaN sample. Combined with 720 nm wavelength excited two-photon fluorescence microscopy in the same sample, the increased defect density around the defect area was found to suppress bandedge photoluminescence, to increase yellow luminescence, to increase bandtail state density, and to decrease residue piezoelectric field intensity. Scanning SHG microscopy of the InGaN MQW sample was resonant excited with 800 nm femtosecond pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser in order to suppress SHG contribution from the bulk GaN substrate. Taking advantage of the strong piezoelectric field inside the InGaN quantum well, the wavelength resonant effect, and the electric field-enhanced SHG effect of InGaN quantum wells, resonant scanning SHG microscopy revealed the piezoelectric field distribution inside the wells. Combined with accompanying three-photon fluorescence microscopy from the bulk GaN substrate underneath the quantum wells, the direct correspondence between the piezoelectric field strength inside the quantum well and the substrate quality can be obtained. According to our study, the GaN substrate area with bright bandedge luminescence corresponds to the area with strong SHG signals indicating a higher stained-induced piezoelectric field. These scanning harmonic generation microscopies exhibit superior images of the piezoelectric field and defect state distributions in GaN and InGaN MQWs not available before.

Channel blocking by ISO overcomes the enhancing effect at higher concentrations. In this study, the effect of coadministered ISO and N2O on responses evoked by GABA in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells carrying alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A)R was investigated. Patch-clamp recordings from these cells were performed in the whole cell mode. A piezo-driven \"liquid filament\" drug application system was used to apply solutions of GABA, ISO, and N2O. Increasing the concentration of ISO in steps from 0.15 to 1.2 mM resulted in a bell-shaped concentration-response curve for GABA-induced currents. The maximum increase in current (1.51 +/- 0.14-fold) was seen at 0.45 mM ISO (about 1 minimum alveolar concentration, EC50). N2O (29.2 mM) increased GABA-evoked currents 1.54 +/- 0.10-fold. The enhancing effects of ISO and N2O on the GABAergic response were not additive. However, a transient current, associated with the rapid withdrawal of ISO from the receptor, was markedly increased by N2O. Such rebound currents probably reflect the transition from a \"channel-blocked\" to a \"reopened\" state. An open-channel block at ligand-gated receptors can prolong postsynaptic currents. Thus, we conclude that coadministered N2O could increase the enhancing effect of ISO on the GABAergic transmission by an increase in open-channel block at the GABA(A)R.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2001-06-16", "authors": ["GHapfelmeier", "RHaseneder", "EKochs", "MBeyerle", "WZieglg\u00e4nsberger"], "doi": null}

Transcription analysis showed that expression of pvdF was regulated by the amount of iron in the growth medium, consistent with its role in siderophore production.

Multiple dispersion curves of Lamb waves are accurately determined over a wide frequency range (4 to 20 MHz).

Laboratory experiments with this new mechanical form of radiation showed that it was capable of producing an astonishing variety of physical, chemical and biologic effects. In this review, the early findings on bioeffects are discussed, especially those from experiments done in the first few decades, as well as the concepts employed in explaining them. Some recent findings are discussed also, noting how the old and the new are related. In the first few decades, bioeffects research was motivated partly by curiosity, and partly by the wish to increase the effectiveness and ensure the safety of therapeutic US. Beginning in the 1970s, the motivation has come also from the need for safety guidelines relevant to diagnostic US. Instrumentation was developed for measuring acoustic pressure in the fields of pulsed and focused US employed, and standards were established for specifying the fields of commercial equipment. Critical levels of US quantities were determined from laboratory experiments, together with biophysical analysis, for bioeffects produced by thermal and nonthermal mechanisms.

We found that heat generation at off-resonance is caused mainly by dielectric loss tan delta' (i.e., P-E hysteresis loss), not by mechanical loss, and that a significant decrease in mechanical Qm with an increase of vibration level was observed in resonant piezoelectric ceramic devices, which is due to an increase in the extensive dielectric loss, not in the extensive mechanical loss.

In this paper, a method called interdigital pair bonding (IPB) is used to prepare 1-3 piezoelectric composite with a pitch of 40 microns, a kerf of 4 microns, and a ceramic volume fraction of 81%. The composites prepared in this fashion exhibited a very pure thickness-mode resonance up to a frequency of 50 MHz.

The mechanisms for the elimination of the lateral modes at high frequency are discussed. The effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of the composite was 0.72 at a frequency of 50 MHz.

The optical system for AF-ESPI is then employed to analyze the volume vibration of piezoelectric material for a rectangular parallelepiped configuration.

All of the accepted procedures define some resonator geometries, each of them related with a set of parameters, that can be obtained following resonance measurements at the corresponding resonance frequencies. The basis of the standards is the existence, for each geometry, of well-defined modes that have been analytically solved. The development of multi-dimensional models of the waves' propagation in piezoceramic materials opens the possibility of characterizing piezoelectric resonators with geometries different from those recommended in the standards. In this paper, a two-dimensional model, which takes into account the mechanical and dielectric losses, has been used to characterize piezoceramics with the shape of a regular parallelepiped. A set of elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric parameters, which are useful for piezoelectric transducer design, can be obtained. For a given sample, the measured input electrical impedance is used to obtain the parameters by means of a fitting process with the corresponding model output. The results obtained with low and high loss materials show that the parameters found have values similar to those obtained following the procedures and geometries recommended by the standards.

The model includes dielectric losses and mechanical losses in the transducer material layers as well as sound absorption in the transmission medium. First, the so-called constitutive relations of a piezoelectric body are derived based on general thermodynamic considerations, assuming that transducer operation takes place under almost isentropic conditions. Second, full attention is given to transducers oscillating in the thickness mode, discarding all other vibration modes. Dynamic transducer equations are determined using Newton's Second Law, Poisson's equation, and the definition of strain applied to a piezoelectric transducer with one or more non-piezoelectric layers on the front surface (multilayer transducer). Boundary conditions include continuity of normal velocity and stress across material interfaces as well as a subsidiary electrical condition over the piezoceramic electrodes. Sound transmission is assumed to take place in a water bath such that the Rayleigh equation can be used to obtain the incoming pressure at the receiver aperture from the acceleration of the opposing transmitter. This allows, e.g., a detailed treatment of receiver signal variations as the receiver moves from the near-field zone to the far-field zone of the transmitter. In the remaining part of the paper, receiver voltage and current signals are obtained by solving the full set of dynamic equations numerically.

{"title": "Cisapride decreases gastroesophageal reflux in preterm infants.", "abstract": "Gastrointestinal prokinetic agents, such as cisapride, are commonly used in pediatric practice to improve gastric emptying, to decrease emesis, to improve lower esophageal sphincter tone, and to improve irritability and feeding aversion associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Although cisapride seems to be effective in infants from 2 months to 14 years old, data for younger and preterm infants are not available. Whether reflux is a significant cause of reflex apnea or feeding intolerance in the preterm infant is controversial. The objective of this 1-year prospective study, started in 1998, was to determine the efficacy of cisapride for treatment of reflux and reflux-associated apnea (RAAP) in preterm infants. Before this study, the diagnosis of reflux was often made clinically and the effect of therapy on reflux or the decision to increase the dose of cisapride was made empirically. The clinical bias was that persistent apnea, not responding to caffeine, was caused by GER. We reasoned that a systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of reflux would improve the care of preterm infants and reduce the risk of toxicity, especially if an increased dose of cisapride showed no improvement in reflux or apnea.\nTwenty-four preterm infants (24-36 weeks' gestational age) had clinical apnea/pH studies when they were referred by the attending neonatologist for suspected GER. These infants were born at 28.8 +/- 3.1 weeks with birth weight of 1169 +/- 387 g (range: 631-2263 g). Each infant was studied before and 8 days after starting cisapride treatment. Cisapride dose was 0.09 to 0.25 mg/kg every 6 hours enterally. Treatment decisions regarding dose of cisapride were the responsibility of the attending neonatologist. The pH was recorded continuously for 24 hours at 0.25 Hz and was analyzed using EsopHogram software. A single sensor pH catheter was inserted to ~2 cm above the esophageal gastric junction. GER was defined as a drop in esophageal pH below 4.0 for a least 5 seconds, or pathologic GER was defined as a reflux index (RI) >2 standard deviation (SD) from the mean based on published norms for term infants. The following parameters were calculated from the pH recording: number of reflux events per 24 hours, duration of the longest episode, number of episodes >5 minutes per 24 hours, and RI, ie, percentage of time with pH <4.0. Each study had a combined time-lapse video recording and multichannel digital recording. Recorded parameters were: continuous pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, respiratory effort (piezo sensor), and airflow (temperature sensor at nostrils and mouth). The recording was scored for central apneas of 10 to 14 seconds and >/=15 seconds (prolonged) and >/=10 seconds for obstructive and mixed apneas. RAAP was scored when an apnea (irrespective of the type) occurred within 1 minute of a GER event. Baseline, after cisapride, and follow-up electrocardiograms were performed because of concern about prolonged QTc and cardiac arrhythmias. The infants were 35.6 +/- 4.5 weeks postconceptional age when first studied. Twelve infants (mean birth weight: 1821 +/- 749 g; gestational age: 32 +/- 2 weeks; postconceptional age: 35.6 +/- 2.6 weeks) were identified retrospectively as controls because their baseline GER parameters were within the normal range using Vandenplas' criteria.\nOverall, cisapride treatment significantly improved the RI from 16.6 +/- 15.2 to 9.1 +/- 8.4 SD. The number of reflux episodes >/=5 minutes was reduced from 7.1 +/- 5.8 to 4.3 +/- 4.4 SD. No significant effect was seen on the total number of refluxes (/24 hours). Eight infants (33%) had no decrease in the RI after a week of treatment. Three of these infants improved after cisapride dose was increased from 0.09 to 0.25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours. Although 0.09 mg/kg/day is the minimum effective dose, 67% of our infants did respond to this low dose. Cisapride was discontinued in 3 infants because of prolonged QTc >/=0.450 seconds (0.473 in 1 and 0.470 in 2). More data about the effect of cisapride on QTc interval are reported in Pediatrics in a separate article. Only 1 infant showed no improvement with increased dose. Caffeine treatment had no effect on the baseline or follow-up GER values. Although apnea indexes for central and obstructive apnea were similar before and after cisapride, mixed apnea was less during treatment. There was a significant decrease (0.32 +/- 0.40 to 0.12 +/- 0.17/hour) in RAAP when the one infant who had increased reflux on increased dose of cisapride was excluded as an outlier. The statistical difference, before and after cisapride, for the group is significant with the outlier omitted. The clinical significance is unclear because ~50% of the infants had minimal changes in their apnea indexes. Furthermore, ~40% of infants did not have RAAP.

In addition, the mechanomyogram (MMG) was recorded simultaneously with a MIC transducer and accelerometer (ACC) during voluntary contractions to confirm the mechanical variable reflected by the actual MMG and to examine the influence of motion artifact on the MMG. To measure the displacement-frequency response, mechanical sinusoidal vibrations of 3 to 300 Hz were applied to the MIC transducer with different sizes of air chambers (5, 10, 15 and 20 mm in diameter and 15, 20 or 25 mm long). The MIC transducer showed a linear relationship between the output amplitude and the vibration displacement, however, its frequency response declined with decreasing diameter and decreasing length of the air chamber. In fact, the cut-off frequency (-3dB) of the MIC transducer with the 5-mm-diameter chamber was 10, 8 and 4 Hz for the length 15, 20 and 25 mm, respectively. The air chamber with at least a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 15 mm is recommended for the MIC transducer. The sensitivity of this MIC transducer arrangement was 92 mV microm(-1) when excited at 100 Hz. During voluntary contraction, the amplitude spectral density function of the MMG from the MIC transducer resembled that of the double integral of the ACC transducer signal. The angle of the MIC transducer was delayed by 180 degrees in relation to the ACC transducer signal. The sensitivity of the MIC transducer was reduced to one-third because of the peculiar volume change of air chamber when the MMG was detected on the surface of the skin. In addition, the MIC transducer was contaminated by a smaller motion artifact than that from the ACC transducer. The maximal peak amplitude of the MIC and ACC transducer signal with the motion artifact was 7.7 and 12.3 times as much as the RMS amplitude of each signal without the motion artifact, respectively. These findings suggest that the MIC transducer acts as a displacement meter in the MMG. The MIC transducer seems to be a possible candidate for recording the MMG during dynamic muscle contractions as well as during sustained contractions.", "journal": "Medical & biological engineering & computing", "date": "2001-05-22", "authors": ["MWatakabe", "KMita", "KAkataki", "YItoh"], "doi": "10.1007/BF02344804"}

Every cavity type was obturated with a flowable (Tetric flow) and with a hybrid composite (Tetric ceram). One group consisted of prefabricated ceramic inlays (Sonicsys approx) and one group was filled with a three-site light curing technique. This resulted in 128 composite fillings. The evaluation of the quality of the margins under the SEM demonstrated a statistically significant higher percentage of perfect margins for Siplus compared with the PCS-System (88% versus 58% perfect margins). Marginal adaptation before and after thermocycling demonstrated the following results: Bewelled margins showed in general better adaptation than box-shaped cavities. Similar results were found for normal and flowable composites. Microcavities with occlusal access prepared with the sonicsys halfsphere showed in general better marginal adaptation in comparison to the other methods tested.

In the sandwich ELISA system, the cytokine capture antibodies were immobilized onto PDVF membranes. The membranes were then incubated with single cytokine or a combination of different cytokines. The captured cytokines were detected by biotin-conjugated antibodies coupled with ECL system. Experiments demonstrated that multiple IgGs and cytokines could be simultaneously detected using this approach with high specificity and sensitivity.

{"title": "Biomechanical aspects in implantable microphones and hearing aids and development of a concept with a hydroacoustical transmission.", "abstract": "The middle ear functions as a sensitive pressure receptor. This implies that it not only transmits sound pressure waves with molecule-sized vibrational amplitudes, but that it also reacts to the million times larger variations of ambient air pressure. This pressure induces movements of the tympanic membrane and of the attached ossicular chain of up to 1,000 microm. Any artificial device that contacts these sound-transporting elements, be it a receiver for an implantable microphone or a transducer for an implantable hearing aid, has to respect these two different modes of biomechanical behavior. A hydroacoustical transmission system has therefore been developed consisting of a water-filled flexible tube, which contacts the ossicular chain with a balloon tip, and which is connected to a piezo-electric transducer at its other end. This soft contact prevents a localized pressure load and does not restrain the free movement of the underlying ossicle during ambient pressure variations. Temporal bone experiments showed that the device transmits vibration energy in good acoustical quality. The device can also be used in a reverse mode, working as a microphone, for example for a totally implantable hearing aid or a cochlear implant.

The emission peak has a full width at half-maximum of only 8 nm. The stain exhibits exceptional photostability, allowing long exposure times for maximum sensitivity.

{"title": "Determination of quadrupole parameters with a composite pulse for spurious signal suppression.", "abstract": "Spurious signals such as the piezoelectric signal from a ferroelectric crystal or the ringing signal from the NMR probe head tuned for low gyromagnetic ratio nuclei are often observed in pulsed NMR. Both signals are cancelled using the Hahn echo sequence with appropriate phase cyclings. The present paper applies a composite-pulse sequence to cancel the ringing signal. The main advantage of this sequence over the Hahn echo sequence is in the simplicity of optimizing the line intensity: the optimization of only one pulse duration for this sequence but of two pulse durations and the interpulse delay for the Hahn echo sequence. We are interested in half-integer quadrupole spins (I = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, and 9/2), which means that we must consider the first-order quadrupole interaction during the pulses. For simplicity, we deal mainly with spin I = 3/2 nuclei. Since the central-line intensity depends on the ratio of the quadrupole coupling constant (QCC) to the amplitude of the RF pulse, we can determine the QCC from a featureless lineshape by fitting the variation of the experimental central-line intensity for increasing pulse duration with theoretical results. Contrary to the one-pulse sequence where the central-line intensity is proportional to the pulse duration if the latter is short, there is no such condition with the composite-pulse sequence. In other words, this sequence does not allow us to quantify the relative spin populations in powders. The size of the sample must be much smaller than that of the RF coil in order for the RF magnetic field to become homogeneous for the sample.

High rates of parthenogenetic cleavage were obtained with chemical activation using ethanol/cycloheximide (65%) compared with other standard chemical activation methods (4-28%). This type of activation was also effective in reestablishing cleavage capability (19-71%), in a time-dependent manner, of spontaneously activated eggs arrested at a second prophase-like state.

{"title": "Noise transmission from a curved panel into a cylindrical enclosure: analysis of structural acoustic coupling.", "abstract": "Much of the research on sound transmission through the aircraft fuselage into the interior of aircraft has considered coupling of the entire cylinder to the acoustic modes of the enclosure. Yet, much of the work on structural acoustic control of sound radiation has focused on reducing sound radiation from individual panels into an acoustic space. Research by the authors seeks to bridge this gap by considering the transmission of sound from individual panels on the fuselage to the interior of the aircraft. As part of this research, an analytical model of a curved panel, with attached piezoelectric actuators, subjected to a static pressure load was previously developed. In the present work, the analytical model is extended to consider the coupling of a curved panel to the interior acoustics of a rigid-walled cylinder. Insight gained from an accurate analytical model of the dynamics of the noise transmission from the curved panels of the fuselage into the cylindrical enclosure of an aircraft is essential to the development of feedback control systems for the control of stochastic inputs, such as turbulent boundary layer excitation. The criteria for maximal structural acoustic coupling between the modes of the curved panel and the modes of the cylindrical enclosure are studied. For panels with aspect ratios typical of those found in aircraft, results indicate that predominately axial structural modes couple most efficiently to the acoustic modes of the enclosure. The effects of the position of the curved panel on the cylinder are also studied. Structural acoustic coupling is found to not be significantly affected by varying panel position.

{"title": "New piezoelectric polymer for air-borne and water-borne sound transducers.", "abstract": "Acoustic transducers made of a charged cellular polymer called EMFi have been designed and investigated with respect to air-borne and water-borne sound. The longitudinal transducer constant is around 90 pC/N, strongly exceeding the values of other piezoelectric polymers. This is mainly attributed to the very low Young's modulus of about 2 MPa. The acoustic impedance is only 2.6 x 10(4) kg/(m2 s) and results in good matching to air but strong loading under water. Due to this strong loading, a pronounced reduction of resonance frequency from 300 kHz in air down to 17 kHz under water is observed. The experiments indicate that fluid loading is not only mass-like but also compliant, reducing the transducer's sensitivity below the resonance frequency of about -63 dB re 1 V/Pa (0.7 mV/Pa) in air to -71 dB re 1 V/Pa under water. This compliance is attributed to the medium's compressibility. Piezoelectricity of EMFi films is limited to temperatures below 70 degrees C; above, irreversible discharge of trapped charges takes place. Furthermore, a second type of EMFi, called \"OS\" was investigated, having a piezoelectric constant of 15 pC/N and a Young's modulus of 6 MPa. In quasi-static sensor measurements, the piezoelectric constant increases with the applied load.

The other was performed with the automated suture delivery device (Perclose/Abbott Labs Inc.) that makes a 7/0 polypropylene interrupted suture. Four piezoelectric crystals were sutured on toe, heel and both lateral sides of each anastomosis to measure anastomotic axes. Anastomotic cross-sectional area (CSAA) was calculated with: CSAA = pi x mM/4 where m and M are the minor and major axes of the elliptical anastomosis. Cross-sectional anastomotic compliance (CSAC) was calculated as CSAC=Delta CSAA/Delta P where Delta P is the mean pulse pressure and Delta CSAA is the mean CSAA during cardiac cycle.\nWe collected a total of 1200000 pressure-length data per animal. For running suture we had a mean systolic CSAA of 26.94+/-0.4 mm(2) and a mean CSAA in diastole of 26.30+/-0.5 mm(2) (mean Delta CSAA was 0.64 mm(2)). CSAC for running suture was 4.5 x 10(-6)m(2)/kPa.

CSAC for interrupted suture was 11 x 10(-6) m(2)/kPa.\nThis model, even with some limitations, can be a reliable source of information improving the outcome of vascular anastomoses. The study demonstrates that suture technique has a substantial effect on cross-sectional anastomotic compliance of end-to-side anastomoses.

At a mean pulse pressure of 33 +/- 8 mmHg, the mean systolodiastolic length difference was 0.3 +/- 0.01 mm for a mean arterial segment of 11.35 +/- 1.25 mm. Systolic and diastolic diameters were 4.1 +/- 0.3 and 3.9 +/- 0.2 mm, respectively. The examined CCA segment displayed a mean axial systolic shortening of 2.7%. This study clearly demonstrates, for the first time, that the length of a segment of the CCA changes during the cardiac cycle and that this movement is inversely correlated with pulse pressure. It is also apparent that the segmental axial strain is significantly smaller than the diameter variation during the cardiac cycle and that the impact of the axial strain for compliance computation should be further evaluated.", "journal": "American journal of physiology.

{"title": "Micro-method to isolate and purify amyloid proteins for chemical characterization.", "abstract": "The amyloidoses represent a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the pathologic deposition as fibrils of at least 20 different precursor molecules. To establish definitively the specific type of amyloid protein contained in fibrillar deposits, such material must be extracted, purified, and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Heretofore, the chemical identification of amyloid components has required gram quantities of tissue. Given the often-limited amounts of sample available, e.g., that derived from diagnostic needle biopsies, we have developed a micro-method to isolate and purify amyloid from minute tissue specimens. The procedure involves micro-extraction of the amyloid with subsequent purification by SDS-PAGE, electroblotting onto PVDF membranes, excision and elution of amyloid protein-related bands, and reversed phase HPLC. Chemical and immunologic studies of isolated amyloid components have demonstrated the purity achieved with this technique and have provided information on the molecular mass, heterogeneity, and immunoreactivity of the amyloid. Further, using this methodology, it has been possible to obtain sufficient material for amino acid sequencing and thus to establish unequivocally the chemical and molecular composition of the fibrillar deposits.

The coupling of capillary high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) allowed one to distinguish phosphorylation sites based on retention time and mass difference from complex peptide mixtures. The methodology was first evaluated and validated for a mixture of non-, mono-, and dityrosine-phosphorylated synthetic peptides, corresponding to the tryptic fragment 485-496 (ALGADDSYYTAR) of the human protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. The limits of detection for the non-, mono- and diphosphorylated peptides were about 15, 40 and 100 fmol, respectively, when using a 300 microm I.D. column. Application of the method was extended to identify phosphopeptides generated from a trypsin digest of recombinant autophosphorylated ZAP-70, in particular with respect to quantifying the status at the regulatory phosphorylation sites Tyr-492 and Tyr-493. Combination of chromatographic and on-line tandem mass spectrometry data allowed one to ascertain the identity of the detected peptides, a prerequisite to analyses in more complex biological samples. As an extension to the methodology described above, we evaluated the feasibility of interfacing capillary HPLC to matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), using a micromachined piezoelectric flow-through dispenser as the interface.

{"title": "Giant lateral electrostriction in ferroelectric liquid-crystalline elastomers.", "abstract": "Mechanisms for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy are essential for the design of nanoscale transducers, sensors, actuators, motors, pumps, artificial muscles, and medical microrobots. Nanometre-scale actuation has to date been mainly achieved by using the (linear) piezoelectric effect in certain classes of crystals (for example, quartz), and 'smart' ceramics such as lead zirconate titanate. But the strains achievable in these materials are small--less than 0.1 per cent--so several alternative materials and approaches have been considered. These include grafted polyglutamates (which have a performance comparable to quartz), silicone elastomers (passive material--the constriction results from the Coulomb attraction of the capacitor electrodes between which the material is sandwiched) and carbon nanotubes (which are slow). High and fast strains of up to 4 per cent within an electric field of 150 MV x m(-1) have been achieved by electrostriction (this means that the strain is proportional to the square of the applied electric field) in an electron-irradiated poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) copolymer. Here we report a material that shows a further increase in electrostriction by two orders of magnitude: ultrathin (less than 100 nanometres) ferroelectric liquid-crystalline elastomer films that exhibit 4 per cent strain at only 1.5 MV x m(-1). This giant electrostriction was obtained by combining the properties of ferroelectric liquid crystals with those of a polymer network.

Electrical-to-mechanical coupling in PMs manifests itself as direct and inverse piezoelectric effects. Measurements performed on the samples with different degrees of PM orientation and at various values of the externally applied cross-membrane electric field indicate that piezoelectric phenomena in PMs arise from the electric asymmetry of the membranes, i.e., they originate from electrostriction. Experiments with samples made of oriented PMs allow estimation of the value of the intrinsic cross-membrane electric field, which is approximately 10(8) V/m.

The shockwave pathway was simulated on the sagittal and coronal views crossing the ureteric calculi, allowing a theoretical evaluation of the effective shockwave focusing (with no bone or gas interference). Vertical and oblique approaches were statistically compared for bone and gas interposition.\nOverall, the effective shockwave focusing during in situ piezoelectric ESWL of distal ureteric stones was 71% of the theoretical area. The interposition of bone and gas was significantly lower for an oblique access than for a vertical approach in the sagittal plane (P < 0.001 and 0.03 on the sagittal and coronal views, respectively). Using stepwise logistic regression, the difference between vertical and oblique accesses in the sagittal plane was mainly affected by the bladder volume (P < 0.001). On the coronal views, the interposition of bone and gas affected 31 patients (89%). Such interference was eliminated in 73% of the patients with a contralateral inclination of the shockwave axis in the coronal plane.\nThe interposition of pelvic bones and abdominal gas in the shockwave pathway can affect the performance of piezoelectric ESWL of distal ureteric stones.

A 6MHz quartz crystal was used as the frequency determining element. Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) type specific antibody raised in rabbits/monoclonal antibody was coated on the crystal surface and the resonance measured. One microlitre of the 10% aqueous suspension of the clinical sample (tongue or foot epithelium) was applied on both surfaces of the crystal and the resonance recorded. A difference in resonance of more than -2.5Hz was obtained in positive samples (homologous antigen and antibody). The test was standardized initially using various dilutions of FMD tissue culture antigen. Repeatability and sensitivity were also tested and it was found that the crystals could be washed and reused eight times. The test could be used for FMDV type specifically and no cross-reaction between FMDV types was observed. The shelf-life of the antibody-coated crystal stored at room temperature was 18 weeks. Application of the biosensor test to the FMDV clinical samples confirmed virus typing results when compared with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and it could also detect virus in ELISA negative samples and mixed virus infections.", "journal": "Veterinary microbiology", "date": "2001-02-22", "authors": ["M RGajendragad", "K NKamath", "P YAnil", "KPrabhudas", "CNatarajan"], "doi": "10.1016/s0378-1135(00)00307-2"}
{"title": "Electrophysiological evaluation of oropharyngeal swallowing in myotonic dystrophy.", "abstract": "Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a common feature of patients with myotonic dystrophy and is not usually perceived due to their emotional deficits and lack of interest. The aim was to show the existence and frequency of subclinical electrophysiological abnormalities in oropharyngeal swallowing and to clarify the mechanisms of dysphagia in myotonic dystrophy.\nEighteen patients with myotonic dystrophy were examined for oropharyngeal phase of swallowing by clinical and electrophysiological methods. Ten patients had dysphagia whereas 11 patients had signs and symptoms reflecting CNS involvement. Four patients with myotonia congenita and 30 healthy volunteers served as controls. Laryngeal movements were detected by means of a piezoelectric sensor. EMG activities of the submental muscle (SM-EMG) and needle EMG of the cricopharyngeal muscle of the upper eosophageal sphincter (CP-EMG) were also recorded during swallowing.\nIn about 70% of the patients with myotonic dystrophy, the existence of oropharyngeal dysphagia was indicated objectively by means of the technique of \"dysphagia limit\" and by clinical evaluation. Duration of the swallowing reflex as defined by the laryngeal relocation time (0-2 time interval) and submental muscle excitation as a part of the swallowing reflex (A-C interval) were significantly prolonged in patients with myotonic dystrophy, especially in dysphagic patients. Triggering time of the swallowing reflex (A-0 interval) also showed significant prolongation, especially in the patients having both dysphagia and CNS involvement. During swallowing, CP muscle activity was abnormal in 40% of the patients with myotonic dystrophy.\nBoth myopathic weakness and myotonia encountered in oropharyngeal muscles play an important part in the oral and the pharyngeal phases of swallowing dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy. It was also suggested that CNS involvement might contribute to the delay of the triggering of the swallowing reflex and some abnormal EMG findings in the CP sphincter, resulting in oropharyngeal dysphagia in myotonic dystrophy.", "journal": "Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry", "date": "2001-02-22", "authors": ["CErtekin", "NY\u00fcceyar", "NoneAydo\u011fdu", "HKarasoy"], "doi": "10.1136/jnnp.70.3.363"}

(1995) J. Biochem. 118, 453-460], the binding protein was surveyed using the (32)P-labeled protein by casein kinase II as a screening probe. When the cytosolic proteins from oocytes were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and incubated with the labeled protein, only one protein with M(r) 43,000 was visualized on autoradiography. This protein was purified to a nearly homogeneous state through several column chromatography steps. The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal region of this protein identified it as a kind of serine protease inhibitor (serpin) [Holland, L.J. et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7053-7059]. However, the M(r) 25,000 protein did not have any effect on the inhibitory action of this serpin on alpha-chymotrypsin. In addition, several binding proteins were also detected in the particulate fraction of oocytes, although the exact identity of these proteins is not clear at this time. These results suggest that the M(r) 25,000 protein may play some role(s) by interacting with these binding proteins in Xenopus oocytes.", "journal": "Journal of biochemistry", "date": "2001-02-15", "authors": ["NGoto", "SMuto", "ISugimoto", "KIkawa-Kitayama", "KIgarashi", "SIto", "EHashimoto"], "doi": "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a002849"}

This technique is based on 'tissue printing' to visualize enzyme activity. The freshly-cut surface (transverse direction) of the root of three species, Japanese radish (Raphanus sativus), turnip (Brassica campestris) and Japanese horseradish (wasabi, Wasabia japonica), was pressed onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter to immobilize the proteins onto the membrane. The sites of myrosinase activity on the membranes were visualized by the sinigrin-glucose oxidase-peroxidase system. Signals for myrosinase activity were observed in both the epidermis and vascular cambium of the root of the Japanese radish, turnip and wasabi. Measurement of myrosinase activity in protein extracts indicated that the level of myrosinase activity in the peeling, which consisted of the epidermis, cortex and vascular cambium, was much higher than that in the peeled root of the three species. These results support the image that myrosinase activity, obtained in tissue printing, corresponded well with the tissue distribution of myrosinase activity.", "journal": "Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology", "date": "2001-02-13", "authors": ["MHara", "HEto", "TKuboi"], "doi": "10.1016/s0168-9452(00)00400-3"}

{"title": "Influence of sperm immobilization on onset of Ca(2+) oscillations after ICSI.", "abstract": "Sperm immobilization prior to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is thought to be necessary for efficient fertilization. A variety of methods of sperm immobilization (pipetting, squeezing and piezo application) are currently employed in ICSI. The effect of differences in immobilization method on the timing of initial Ca(2+) oscillations of oocytes in ICSI was investigated. Motile spermatozoa were immobilized in eosin Y solution using pipetting, squeezing and piezo application. Complete staining of the sperm head was achieved after 220.7, 42.2 and 5.0 s respectively. Oscillations after ICSI were measured fluorometrically for each method. The onset of Ca(2+) oscillations was observed at 4.8 to 80.4 min after ICSI. Ca(2+) oscillations developed earlier with the piezo method (14.4 +/- 6.4 min) than other methods (pipetting, 43.1 +/- 20.2 min, P < 0.01; squeezing, 18.4 +/- 3.8 min, P = NS). The piezo method produced the earliest staining of the sperm head and may have caused the most damage to the sperm membrane. A more rapid onset of Ca(2+) oscillations was also observed with the piezo method. The method of sperm immobilization may be important for the rapid release of sperm factors that initiate oocyte activation. This study also showed that Ca(2+) oscillations develop earlier in human oocytes treated by ICSI than indicated in previous reports.", "journal": "Human reproduction (Oxford, England)", "date": "2001-01-05", "authors": ["KYanagida", "HKatayose", "SHirata", "HYazawa", "SHayashi", "ASato"], "doi": "10.1093/humrep/16.1.148"}
{"title": "Two-dimensional manipulation of differentiated Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell sheets: the noninvasive harvest from temperature-responsive culture dishes and transfer to other surfaces.", "abstract": "A renal epithelial cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, adheres, spreads, and proliferates to confluency on our developed temperature-responsive culture dishes grafted with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) at 37 degrees C. In addition to other cell types, including hepatocytes and endothelial cells, MDCK cell sheets noninvasively were harvested from PIPAAm-grafted dishes merely by reducing the temperature. However, during the early stage of culture (up to 3 weeks), confluent MDCK cell detachment is greatly repressed. In the present study, we succeeded in the rapid harvest of confluent MDCK cell sheets and intact transfer to other culture dishes by utilizing hydrophilically modified poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membranes as supporting materials. Immunocytochemistry with anti-beta-catenin antibody revealed that the functional cell-cell junctions were well organized in the transferred MDCK cell sheets. The viability assay showed that the transferred cells were not damaged during the two-dimensional cell-sheet manipulation. By transmission electron microscopy it was confirmed that the harvested MDCK cells retained differentiated phenotypes and had many microvilli and tight junctions at the apical and lateral plasma membranes, respectively. This two-dimensional cell-sheet manipulation technique promises to be useful in tissue engineering as well as in the investigation of epithelial cell sheets.", "journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research", "date": "2000-11-15", "authors": ["AKushida", "MYamato", "AKikuchi", "TOkano"], "doi": "10.1002/1097-4636(200101)54:1<37::aid-jbm5>3.0.co;2-7"}
