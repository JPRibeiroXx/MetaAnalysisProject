{"title": "Single Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and Active Sound Suppression.", "abstract": "Whether intentionally generating acoustic waves or attempting to mitigate unwanted noise, sound control is an area of challenge and opportunity. This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70\u00a0dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness was found-through comparative fabric analysis-to influence acoustic-emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration-mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130-\u03bcm silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.

New ways to fabricate flexible ultrasound patches have therefore attracted much attention recently. First prototypes typically use the same lead-containing piezo-electric materials, and are made using micro-assembly of rigid active components on plastic or rubber-like substrates.

The PVDF filled with activated carbon nanomaterial from human hair (AC-HH) exhibits improved surface charge density and photoinduced charge generation. These remarkable properties are attributed to the presence of graphene-like nanostructures in AC-HH, contributing to the augmented performance of PVDF@AC-HH TENG. The correlation of surface morphologies, surface charge potential, charge capacitance properties, and TENG electrical output of the PVDF composites at various AC-HH loading is studied and discussed. Applications of the PVDF@AC-HH TENG as a power source for micro/nanoelectronics and a movement sensor for detecting finger gestures are also demonstrated. The photoresponse property of the fabricated TENG is demonstrated and analyzed in-depth. The analysis indicates that the photoinduced charge carriers originate from the conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO), contributing to the enhanced surface charge density of the PVDF composite film.

{"title": "Remote Control of Energy Transformation-Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy.", "abstract": "Cancer treatment requires precise tumor-specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high-resolution diagnostic imaging and long-term patient-tailorable cancer therapy while minimizing side effects largely arising from non-targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue-penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long-term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities.

We present an ultracompact STM within a \u03a6 10 piezo tube in a 20\u00a0T superconducting magnet. The carefully cut piezo tube contains the STM's coarse-positioning assembly. Loading an STM tip-sample mechanical loop into the piezo tube with special cut openings enables an ultracompact pencil-size dimension down to \u03a6 10\u00a0mm, in which fine-machined nonmagnetic parts are assembled to enable slide-stick motion and xyz-scanning procedures. The small size leads to a higher resonant frequency, a typical feature of a rigid STM instrument, increasing its vibration immunity. Scanning by moving the sample while keeping the tip stationary improves the stability of the tip-sample junction compared to moving the tip. Taking advantage of its high-field compatibility and rigid design, our STM captures the atomically resolved topography of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) at 1.5\u00a0K and in magnetic fields up to 17\u00a0T. The topography of graphene lattice and graphite is simultaneously recorded on an atomic terrace of HOPG, unveiling a modified local charge density at a surface defect.

Nanofibers with good designability, controllable morphologies, large specific areas, and unique physicochemical properties provide a promising platform for PTEGs for various advanced applications. However, the further development of nanofiber-based PTEGs is limited by technical difficulties, ranging from materials design to device integration. Herein, we systematically review the current developments in PTEGs based on electrospun nanofibers. The review begins with the mechanisms of PTEGs and the advantages of nanofibers and nanodevices, including high breathability, waterproofness, scalability, and thermal-moisture comfort. In terms of materials and structural design, novel electroactive nanofibers and structure assemblies based on one-dimensional micro/nanostructures, two-dimensional bionic structures, and three-dimensional multilayered structures are discussed. Subsequently, nanofibrous PTEGs in applications such as energy harvesters, personalized medicine, personal protective equipment, and human-machine interactions are summarized. Nanofiber-based PTEGs still face many challenges such as energy efficiency, material durability, device stability, and device integration. In the final section of this review, the research gap between research and practical applications of PTEGs is discussed, and emerging trends are proposed, providing some ideas for the development of intelligent wearables.

{"title": "Effect of Sonication Batch on Electrical Properties of Graphitic-Based PVDF-HFP Strain Sensors for Use in Health Monitoring.", "abstract": "In this study, flexible nanocomposites made from PVDF-HFP reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are manufactured using a sonication and solvent casting method for monitoring purposes. More specifically, the effect of the volume batch under the sonication process is explored. For CNT-based composites, the electrical conductivity decreases as the batch volume increases due to less effective dispersion of the CNTs during the 30-min sonication. The maximum electrical conductivity achieved in this type of sensor is 1.44 \u00b1 0.17 S/m. For the GNP-based nanocomposites, the lower the batch volume is, the more breakage of nanoplatelets is induced by sonication, and the electrical response decreases. This is also validated by AC analysis, where the characteristic frequencies are extracted. Here, the maximum electrical conductivity measured is 8.66 \u00b1 1.76 S/m. The electromechanical results also show dependency on the batch volume. In the CNT-based nanocomposites, the higher gauge factor achieved corresponds to the batch size, where the sonication may be more effective because it leads to a dispersed pathway formed by aggregates connected by tunneling mechanisms. In contrast, in the CNT-based nanocomposites, the GF depends on the lateral size of the GNPs. The biggest GF of all sensors is achieved with the PVDF-HFP/GNP sensors, having a value of 69.36 \u00d7 10", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["VictorD\u00edaz-Mena", "Xoan FS\u00e1nchez-Romate", "Mar\u00edaS\u00e1nchez", "AlejandroUre\u00f1a"], "doi": "10.3390/s24062007\n10.1038/s41528-023-00261-4\n10.1039/C7LC00914C\n10.1038/s41578-022-00460-x\n10.1109/TBME.2006.889186\n10.3390/s22197639\n10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100541\n10.3390/bios12080651\n10.1016/j.sbsr.2021.100434\n10.3390/bios12080630\n10.1002/admt.202100773\n10.3390/chemosensors10020075\n10.3390/s21165277\n10.3390/polym14214503\n10.1002/aelm.201500142\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2022.109563\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108038\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2020.108617\n10.1016/j.sna.2023.114249\n10.1007/s10854-021-07540-8\n10.1016/j.measen.2023.100928\n10.1016/j.mattod.2019.12.004\n10.1016/j.nanoms.2021.11.003\n10.1155/2012/652438\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.04.142\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.122985\n10.1007/s00542-022-05269-w\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.128127\n10.1016/j.adna.2023.10.001\n10.1016/j.carbon.2013.05.024\n10.3390/polym13234128\n10.1002/app.31488\n10.1002/polb.20223\n10.1039/c3tc31774a\n10.1515/msp-2015-0020\n10.1039/D3RA00549F\n10.1007/s11434-013-5697-2\n10.1021/acsnano.0c06809\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.04.034\n10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.131593\n10.1016/j.compositesb.2014.12.012\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2018.03.007\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.05.108\n10.1016/j.mtchem.2019.04.006\n10.1016/j.carbon.2020.06.029\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.12.026\n10.3390/nano11020550\n10.1002/masy.201900168\n10.1007/s10853-010-5148-2\n10.1088/0022-3727/46/38/385305\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.05.026\n10.1016/j.polymertesting.2021.107178"}

Early initiation of mouth-opening exercises is crucial for preventing or minimizing trismus. Current methods for these exercises predominantly involve finger exercises and traditional mouth-opening training devices. Our research group successfully designed an intelligent mouth-opening training device (IMOTD) that addresses the limitations of traditional home training methods, including the inability to quantify mouth-opening exercises, a lack of guided training resulting in temporomandibular joint injuries, and poor training continuity leading to poor training effect. For this device, an interactive remote guidance mode is introduced to address these concerns. The device was designed with a focus on the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. The accuracy of the training data was verified through piezoelectric sensor calibration. Through mechanical analysis, the stress points of the structure were identified, and finite element analysis of the connecting rod and the occlusal plate connection structure was conducted to ensure the safety of the device. The findings support the effectiveness of the intelligent device in rehabilitation through preclinical experiments when compared with conventional mouth-opening training methods. This intelligent device facilitates the quantification and visualization of mouth-opening training indicators, ensuring both the comfort and safety of the training process.

{"title": "Design Optimization of Piezocomposites Using a Homogenization Model: From Analytical Model to Experimentation.", "abstract": "In the process of activating non-conductive smart-structures using piezoelectric patches, one possible method is to add a conductive layer to ensure electrical contact of both electrodes of the ceramic. Therefore, depending on the stiffness and the thickness of this layer, changes in the overall piezoelectric properties lead to a loss in the electromechanical coupling that can be implemented. The purpose of this work is to study the impact of this added electrode layer depending on its thickness. A model of the effect of this layer on the piezoelectrical coefficients has been derived from the previous approach of Hashimoto and Yamagushi and successfully compared to experimental data. This global model computes the variation of all the piezoelectric coefficients, and more precisely of k31 or d31 for various brass electrode volumes relative to the ceramic volume. A decrease in the lateral electromechanical coupling factor k31 was observed and quantified. NAVY II PZT piezoelectric transducers were characterized using IEEE standard methods, with brass electrode thicknesses ranging from 50 to 400 microns.

{"title": "Flexible 3D Force Sensor Based on Polymer Nanocomposite for Soft Robotics and Medical Applications.", "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) force sensor has become essential in industrial and medical applications. The existing conventional 3D force sensors quantify the three-direction force components at a point of interest or extended contact area. However, they are typically made of rigid, complex structures and expensive materials, making them hard to implement in different soft or fixable industrial and medical applications. In this work, a new flexible 3D force sensor based on polymer nanocomposite (PNC) sensing elements was proposed and tested for its sensitivity to forces in the 3D space. Multi-walled carbon nanotube/polyvinylidene fluoride (MWCNT/PVDF) sensing element films were fabricated using the spray coating technique. The MWCNTs play an essential role in strain sensitivity in the sensing elements. They have been utilized for internal strain measurements of the fixable 3D force sensor's structure in response to 3D forces. The MWCNT/PVDF was selected for its high sensitivity and capability to measure high and low-frequency forces. Four sensing elements were distributed into a cross-beam structure configuration, the most typically used solid 3D force sensor. Then, the sensing elements were inserted between two silicone rubber layers to enhance the sensor's flexibility. The developed sensor was tested under different static and dynamic loading scenarios and exhibited excellent sensitivity and ability to distinguish between tension and compression force directions.

In this work, we successfully developed freely stacked and well-aligned PVDF nanofiber mats with diameters ranging from micrometers to nanometers, providing stable performance for wearable electronic devices.

{"title": "A Novel Piezoelectric Energy Harvester for Earcanal Dynamic Motion Exploitation Using a Bistable Resonator Cycled by Coupled Hydraulic Valves Made of Collapsed Flexible Tubes.", "abstract": "Scavenging energy from the earcanal's dynamic motion during jaw movements may be a practical way to enhance the battery autonomy of hearing aids. The main challenge is optimizing the amount of energy extracted while working with soft human tissues and the earcanal's restricted volume. This paper proposes a new energy harvester concept: a liquid-filled earplug which transfers energy outside the earcanal to a generator. The latter is composed of a hydraulic amplifier, two hydraulic cylinders that actuate a bistable resonator to raise the source frequency while driving an amplified piezoelectric transducer to generate electricity. The cycling of the resonator is achieved using two innovative flexible hydraulic valves based on the buckling of flexible tubes. A multiphysics-coupled model is established to determine the system operation requirements and to evaluate its theoretical performances. This model exhibits a theoretical energy conversion efficiency of 85%. The electromechanical performance of the resonator coupled to the piezoelectric transducer and the hydraulic behavior of the valves are experimentally investigated. The global model was updated using the experimental data to improve its predictability toward further optimization of the design. Moreover, the energy losses are identified to enhance the entire proposed design and improve the experimental energy conversion efficiency to 26%.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["TigranAvetissian", "FabienFormosa", "AdrienBadel", "AidinDelnavaz", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mieVoix"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15030415\n10.1109/SAS.2019.8706115\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2355822\n10.1109/MEMS51670.2022.9699689\n10.1044/2021_AJA-20-00150\n10.1055/s-0042-1758375\n10.1038/nbt.2394\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105781\n10.1007/s00542-015-2766-2\n10.1039/c4ee00242c\n10.1002/admi.202100094\n10.1016/j.esr.2023.101124\n10.3390/polym13142276\n10.1063/1.4971215\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/11/114001\n10.1109/JSEN.2008.917125\n10.1515/ehs-2016-0028\n10.1109/NatPC.2011.6136419\n10.1088/0022-3727/44/29/295501\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2976925\n10.1109/TBME.2011.2163407\n10.1126/science.1139940\n10.1044/2018_AJSLP-18-0049\n10.1016/j.foodres.2018.09.002\n10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.073\n10.1115/1.4034775\n10.1109/JSEN.2023.3235198\n10.3390/en14165077\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107602\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac54e8\n10.1088/0960-1317/14/5/009\n10.1088/0964-1726/17/6/065021\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115518\n10.1016/j.energy.2021.120595\n10.1016/j.renene.2021.03.064\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2022.110034\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac9102\n10.1016/j.ecmx.2022.100290\n10.1016/j.seta.2022.102591\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab9a8d\n10.3390/mi14020261\n10.1088/1361-665X/ab45c6\n10.1117/12.2215000\n10.1115/DETC2013-13611\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.111878\n10.1088/1742-6596/1985/1/012043\n10.1088/0964-1726/22/3/035013\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000000808\n10.1007/978-1-4614-1945-7\n10.1109/JMEMS.2012.2213069\n10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.002\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.023\n10.1109/FLEPS51544.2021.9469861\n10.1002/eom2.12198\n10.3390/proceedings1040584\n10.1007/s10832-012-9713-8\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.107290\n10.1016/B978-0-08-102802-5.00007-8\n10.1109/TPEL.2019.2910410\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.101689\n10.3390/su141710847\n10.1109/ICACCS51430.2021.9442016\n10.1109/JSSC.2019.2896404\n10.1002/adma.201802898\n10.1007/s11664-018-6095-y"}
{"title": "Enhancing Manufacturability of SU-8 Piezoelectric Composite Films for Microsystem Applications.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric thin films are extensively used as sensing or actuating layers in various micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) applications. However, most piezoelectrics are stiff ceramics, and current polymer piezoelectrics are not compatible with microfabrication due to their low Curie Temperature. Recent polymer-composite piezoelectrics have gained interest but can be difficult to pattern. Photodefinable piezoelectric films could resolve these challenges by reducing the manufacturability steps by eliminating the etching process. But they typically have poor resolution and thickness properties. This study explores methods of enhancing the manufacturability of piezoelectric composite films by optimizing the process parameters and synthesis of SU-8 piezo-composite materials. Piezoelectric ceramic powders (barium titanate (BTO) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT)) were integrated into SU-8, a negative epoxy-based photoresist, to produce high-resolution composites in a non-cleanroom environment. I-line (365 nm) light was used to enhance resolution compared to broadband lithography. Two variations of SU-8 were prepared by thinning down SU-8 3050 and SU-8 3005. Different weight percentages of the piezoelectric powders were investigated: 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.% along with varied photolithography processing parameters. The composites' transmittance properties were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy and the films' crystallinity was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD).

{"title": "Self-Powered Flow Rate Sensing via a Single-Electrode Flowing Liquid Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator.", "abstract": "Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as having an important role in the next wave of technology due to their large potential applications in energy harvesting and smart sensing. Recognizing this, a device based on TENGs, which can solve some of the problems in the liquid flow measurement process, was considered. In this paper, a new method to measure the liquid flow rate through a pipe which is based on the triboelectric effect is reported. A single-electrode flowing liquid-based TENG (FL-TENG) was developed, comprising a silicon pipe and an electrode coated with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The measured electrical responses show that the FL-TENG can generate a peak open-circuit voltage and peak short-circuit current of 2.6 V and 0.3 \u00b5A when DI water is passed through an 8 mm cell FL-TENG at a flow rate of 130 mL/min and reach their maximum values of 17.8 V-1.57 \u00b5A at a flow rate of 1170 mL/min, respectively. Importantly, the FL-TENG demonstrates a robust linear correlation between its electrical output and the flow rate, with the correlation coefficient R", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["Duy-LinhVu", "Quang-TanNguyen", "Pil-SeungChung", "Kyoung-KwanAhn"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15030384\n10.1109/TNANO.2020.2976154\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b02332\n10.1016/j.sna.2019.06.020\n10.1016/j.comnet.2008.04.002\n10.3390/polym12020455\n10.1016/j.wear.2021.203893\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112282\n10.1111/jnu.12328\n10.1111/j.1467-9523.2006.00303.x\n10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100123\n10.1016/j.renene.2018.06.114\n10.1016/j.petlm.2018.09.003\n10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2015.01.003\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.046\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2016.11.005\n10.3390/s130201563\n10.3390/mi14112054\n10.3390/s23135888\n10.1002/eom2.12059\n10.1002/admt.201800054\n10.1016/j.mattod.2019.05.016\n10.1016/j.rser.2019.109366\n10.1021/nn4007708\n10.1088/1361-6528/ac97f1\n10.1039/D2TA06942C\n10.3390/mi14101825\n10.3390/mi14081640\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.01.015\n10.1021/acsaenm.3c00416\n10.1016/j.mtsust.2022.100158\n10.1007/s42114-023-00632-5\n10.1002/er.7824\n10.1038/s41467-019-14278-9\n10.1155/2023/3702593\n10.3390/polym15102392\n10.1039/C9SE01184F\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.078\n10.3390/polym14081547\n10.1021/acsnano.6b04440\n10.1021/nn406565k\n10.1021/acsami.1c20509\n10.1002/aenm.202000137\n10.1103/PhysRevE.65.031206\n10.1016/j.cplett.2018.05.007\n10.1016/j.jnnfm.2013.06.003\n10.1021/acs.iecr.8b02759\n10.1080/08927020500423778\n10.1021/acsnano.7b08674\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103904\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105370"}

{"title": "A Novel Nondestructive Testing Probe Using AlN-Based Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs).", "abstract": "Ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) usually utilizes conventional bulk piezoelectric transducers as transceivers. However, the complicated preparation and assembly process of bulk piezoelectric ceramics limits the development of NDT probes toward miniaturization and high frequency. In this paper, a 4.4 mm \u00d7 4.4 mm aluminum nitride (AlN) piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) array is designed, fabricated, characterized, and packaged for ultrasonic pulse-echo NDT of solids for the first time. The PMUT array is prepared based on the cavity silicon-on-insulator (CSOI) process and packaged using polyurethane (PU) material with acoustic properties similar to water. The fabricated PMUT array resonates at 2.183 MHz in air and at around 1.25 MHz after PU encapsulation. The bandwidth of the packaged PMUT receiver (244 kHz) is wider than that of a bulk piezoelectric transducer (179 kHz), which is good for axis resolution improvement. In this work, a hybrid ultrasonic NDT probe is designed using two packaged PMUT receivers and one 1.25 MHz bulk transmitter. The bulk transmitter radiates an ultrasonic wave into the sample, and the defect echo is received by two PMUT receivers. The 2D position of the defect could be figured out by time-of-flight (TOF) difference, and a 30 mm \u00d7 65 mm detection area is acquired. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying AlN PMUTs to ultrasonic NDT of solids and paves the way toward a miniaturized NDT probe using AlN PMUT technology.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-03-28", "authors": ["JiaweiYin", "ZhixinZhou", "LiangLou"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15030306\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa851b\n10.1109/JMEMS.2017.2712101\n10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2921983\n10.1109/JMEMS.2022.3172766\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3037298\n10.1109/JSSC.2014.2364975\n10.1109/TIE.2018.2874583\n10.1109/JMEMS.2020.3018070\n10.1109/OJUFFC.2022.3221708\n10.1038/s41378-023-00518-y\n10.1109/JMEMS.2021.3103756\n10.1063/1.4922915\n10.1109/JMEMS.2015.2503336\n10.1109/JSSC.2016.2604291\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2995424\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3032988\n10.1016/j.sna.2018.05.044\n10.1109/JSEN.2019.2935158\n10.1109/TED.2022.3222662\n10.1109/JMEMS.2016.2577038\n10.1109/JSEN.2018.2797222\n10.1088/1361-6439/abc100\n10.3390/s21248447\n10.1109/JMEMS.2021.3090374\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.101"}
{"title": "Pathological mechanisms of cold and mechanical stress in modulating cancer progression.", "abstract": "Environmental temperature and cellular mechanical force are the inherent factors that participate in various biological processes and regulate cancer progress, which have been hot topics worldwide. They occupy a dominant part in the cancer tissues through different approaches. However, extensive investigation regarding pathological mechanisms in the carcinogenic field. After research, we found cold stress via two means to manipulate tumors: neuroscience and mechanically sensitive ion channels (MICHs) such as TRP families to regulate the physiological and pathological activities. Excessive cold stimulation mediated neuroscience acting on every cancer stage through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocorticoid (HPA) to reach the target organs. Comparatively speaking, mechanical force via Piezo of MICHs controls cancer development. The progression of cancer depends on the internal activation of proto-oncogenes and the external tumorigenic factors; the above two means eventually lead to genetic disorders at the molecular level.

However, studies on the relationships between the PVDF NF diameter, the orientation of the \u03b2-phase crystals inside NFs, and the piezoelectric properties of the NFs are still limited. In this study, the effect of the fiber diameter on the internal molecular packing/orientation and piezoelectric properties of aligned PVDF NF thin films was investigated. Herein, piezoelectric thin films composed of densely packed, uniaxially aligned, PVDF NFs with diameters ranging from 228 to 1315 nm were prepared by means of electrospinning with a rotating collector and successive hot-pressing and poling. The effect of the diameters of PVDF NFs on their internal structures, as well as the piezoelectric properties of the thin films, was investigated. All prepared NFs mainly contained \u03b2-phase crystals with a similar total crystallinity.

However, the fouling phenomenon that takes place during the implantation period blocks pores and causes failure in the local implant. In this study, alumina NPMBs were developed using electrochemical anodization through two steps. Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO), free and impregnated with ZIF-8 MOF, was synthesized and loaded in a mixture of PVDF/PVP polymer matrix at different ratios, and was applied to the produced NPMBs using spin-coater. The NPMBs were characterized before and after coating by SEM/EDX, TEM, FTIR, XRD, contact angle and AFM. The antifouling features of the NPMBs were analyzed against two different bacterial species. The prepared alumina NPMBs demonstrated homogeneous porous structures with pore sizes ranging from 36 to 39 nm. The coated layers were proven to possess microporous coatings on the surfaces of the NPMBs. The numbers of released ions (Al and Zn) from the coated NPMBs were below the allowed limits. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) uptake in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was impressively reduced with the presence of coating materials. In addition, the antifouling behavior of the coated NPMBs against the selected strains of bacteria was greatly enhanced compared with the pure alumina NPMBs. Finally, NPMBs' uncoated and polymer-coated membranes were tested for their ability to deliver donepezil HCl. The results reveal the downregulation of donepezil release, especially from NPMBs coated with PVDF/PVP 0.5GO.

{"title": "A Highly Sensitive Deep-Sea Hydrodynamic Pressure Sensor Inspired by Fish Lateral Line.", "abstract": "Hydrodynamic pressure sensors offer an auxiliary approach for ocean exploration by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). However, existing hydrodynamic pressure sensors often lack the ability to monitor subtle hydrodynamic stimuli in deep-sea environments. In this study, we present the development of a deep-sea hydrodynamic pressure sensor (DSHPS) capable of operating over a wide range of water depths while maintaining exceptional hydrodynamic sensing performance. The DSHPS device was systematically optimized by considering factors such as piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene/barium titanate [P(VDF-TrFE)/BTO] nanofibers, electrode configurations, sensing element dimensions, integrated circuits, and packaging strategies. The optimized DSHPS exhibited a remarkable pressure gradient response, achieving a minimum pressure difference detection capability of approximately 0.11 Pa. Additionally, the DSHPS demonstrated outstanding performance in the spatial positioning of dipole sources, which was elucidated through theoretical charge modeling and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.

First, by using the stable equilibrium positions of the CMM, the total clamping range of the microgripper is divided into multiple smaller clamping sub-intervals to accommodate objects of different scales. Then, the theoretical models of the displacement amplification ratio of the microgripper amplification mechanism and the stiffness of the microgripper in different clamping sub-intervals are established, and the force-displacement characteristics of the CMM are analyzed. Next, through finite element simulation, the correctness of the theoretical analyses is verified, and it is shown that objects between 0 \u00b5m and 1.650\u00a0mm can be clamped using four clamping sub-intervals under a five times displacement amplification ratio.

We studied the potential advantages of the micro-endoscopic approach, supplemented by the piezoelectric technique, to decompress both sides of the vertebral canal, from a one side approach to preserve spine stability, ensuring an adequate neural decompression.\nThe patients were submitted to a selective bilateral decompression, using a monolateral approach, without the skeletonization of the opposite side. For the omo- and the contralateral decompression, we used a microscopic endoscopy-assisted approach, with the assistance of Piezosurgery, for a safe work near the exposed dura mater. Piezoelectric osteotomy is extremely effective in bone removal while safe on soft tissues.\nIn all patients an adequate decompression was achieved with a high rate of spine stability preservation. The approach was essential in minimizing the opening, so reducing the risk of spine instability. Piezoelectric osteotomy was useful to safely perform the undercutting of the base of the spinous process, for a better contralateral vision and decompression without damaging the exposed dura. In all patients a various degree of neurological improvement was observed, with no immediate spine decompensation.\nIn selected cases, the tailored micro-endoscopic monolateral approach for bilateral spine decompression, with piezosurgery assistance, is adequate and safe and showed excellent results in terms of spine decompression and stability preservation.", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "date": "2024-03-25", "authors": ["AlessioIacoangeli", "Mostaf\u00e0Alsagheir", "DenisAiudi", "MaurizioGladi", "AlessandroDi Rienzo", "Domenic PEsposito", "MohammedDiab", "HamzaNaas", "Al\u00ecEldellaa", "AntonioGigante", "MaurizioIacoangeli", "Nabeel SAlshafai", "GustavoLuzardo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2024.03.093"}

The precision and printing efficiency of 3D printing is strongly influenced by the dynamics of ink/binder jetting, which further depends on the ink's fluid properties. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been utilized to study the drop formation process during inkjet-based 3D printing for piezoelectric and thermal printhead geometries using Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. To develop the CFD model commercial software ANSYS-Fluent was used. The developed CFD model was experimentally validated using drop watcher setup to record drop progression and drop velocity. During the study, water, Fujifilm model fluid, and Amitriptyline drug solutions were evaluated as the ink solutions.

The primary focus of this review is to discuss the concepts of piezoelectric energy harvesting, piezoelectric materials, and their application in soft (skin and neural) and hard (dental and bone) tissue regeneration. While discussing the prospective applications as an engineered tissue, an important distinction has been made between piezoceramics, piezopolymers, and their composites.

{"title": "Enhancing piezoelectric performance of CNTs through B and N substitution under combined mechanical loads: Insights from MD Simulations.", "abstract": "The piezoelectric properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) doped with boron (B) and nitrogen (N) were studied using the classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software package Large Scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS). The interactions among the nanotube atoms C, N, and B were calculated using the Tersoff potential. MD simulations were performed to observe the changes in the piezoelectric coefficient of the doped CNTs under loading conditions like tension, torsion, and a combination of both. We considered a wide range of chirality to determine the influence of structural variation on the piezoelectric effect. The study revealed that B-CNTs exhibit superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to N-CNTs, indicating the significant role of dopant type. Moreover, under tensile loading, zigzag-oriented B-CNTs showed higher piezoelectric coefficients with a maximum e33 = 0.2441 C/m2, whereas under torsional loading, armchair-oriented B-CNTs showed enhanced response with a maximum e36 = 0.0564 C/m2. A notable observation was that under combined loading conditions (tensile and torsional), the piezoelectric behavior of the B-CNTs was dependent on the nanotube's chirality and did not yield a linear additive response. The polarization induced under combined loading in most doped CNTs is significantly higher than the sum of polarization generated under individual tensile and torsional loading conditions. This behavior suggests that the overall piezoelectric effect under combined loading can be enhanced, which emphasizes the need for an approach to optimize the mechanical loading condition. The results showcase the potential of B-/N-CNTs to be engineered for efficient performance by demonstrating that tailored mechanical loading can enhance the piezoelectric responses in doped CNTs, opening a pathway for highly functional and efficient nanoscale piezoelectric devices.&#xD.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2024-03-22", "authors": ["NitinLuhadiya", "ShaileshKundalwal"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ad364a"}

We present novel PCB-based 2D matrix ultrasound transducer arrays that are capable of being bulk manufactured at low-cost without using laborious ultrasound fabrication tools. The 2D ultrasound array specifications are easily scalable with respect to widely available PCB design and fabrication tools at low cost.

Subsequently, gene functional analysis of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) was carried out. After screening the characteristic DMGs based on specific conditions, the methylated levels of these DMS were evaluated and verified by pyrosequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the predictive efficacy of corresponding DMGs. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis revealed the correlation between specific DMS and clinical data.\nThe overall DNA methylation level in the obesity group was significantly lower than in normal. A total of 241 DMS were identified. Functional pathway analysis revealed that DMGs were primarily involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, human diseases, among other pathways. The characteristic DMS within the genes Transcription factor A mitochondrial (\nAbnormal DNA methylation is closely related to childhood simple obesity.

{"title": "Effects of a new magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler and a traditional piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler on root surfaces and patient complaints.", "abstract": "Tooth wear and pain are the primary concerns of patients undergoing periodontal scaling. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of a new magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler and a traditional piezoelectric ultrasonic scaler on tooth surface roughness and calculus removal and to determine their impacts on patient discomfort during supragingival cleaning. This article had two parts: an in vitro study and a clinical study. In the in vitro study, thirty teeth with subgingival calculus were randomly assigned to two scaling treatment groups: magnetostrictive scalers (n\u2009=\u200915) and piezoelectric scalers (n\u2009=\u200915). Surface roughness measurements were taken at baseline and after scaling, and the root samples were visualised by SEM after scaling. Additionally, a single-centre randomised split-mouth clinical trial was conducted. Eighty-five participants diagnosed with chronic gingivitis or periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive supragingival scaling. The magnetostrictive scaler was used in half of the mouths (n\u2009=\u200985), and the piezoelectric scaler was used in the other half of the mouths (n\u2009=\u200985). Data on pain, noise, and vibration were collected using a VAS questionnaire, and the operating time was recorded. In both in vitro and clinical studies, magnetostrictive scalers were reported to be more effective than piezoelectric scalers in removing dental deposits (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, the root surface after scaling with the magnetostrictive scaler was smoother than that after scaling with the piezoelectric scaler in the in vitro study (P\u2009=\u20090.02). SEM examination also revealed that fewer dental materials were lost after instrumentation with the magnetostrictive scaler than after instrumentation with the piezoelectric scaler. Piezoelectric scalers caused less discomfort to patients in terms of pain, noise, and vibration than magnetostrictive scalers (P\u2009<\u20090.05). According to this clinical study, the magnetostrictive scaler caused more discomfort during supragingival scaling than the piezoelectric scaler.

Here, we performed quantitative facial videography from mice resting atop a piezoelectric force plate and observed that broadband sounds elicited rapid and stereotyped facial twitches. Facial motion energy (FME) adjacent to the whisker array was 30 dB more sensitive than the acoustic startle reflex and offered greater inter-trial and inter-animal reliability than sound-evoked pupil dilations or movement of other facial and body regions. FME tracked the low-frequency envelope of broadband sounds, providing a means to study behavioral discrimination of complex auditory stimuli, such as speech phonemes in noise. Approximately 25% of layer 5-6 units in the auditory cortex (ACtx) exhibited firing rate changes during facial movements. However, FME facilitation during ACtx photoinhibition indicated that sound-evoked facial movements were mediated by a midbrain pathway and modulated by descending corticofugal input. FME and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were closely aligned after noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss, yet FME growth slopes were disproportionately steep at spared frequencies, reflecting a central plasticity that matched commensurate changes in ABR wave 4.

However, in a practical piezoelectric-transducer-activated system, both S0 and A0 (zero-order antisymmetric) mode Lamb waves are inevitably excited, while only the former is responsible for cumulative effects. The generation efficiency of the cumulative second harmonics is then affected by the presence of the A0 waves. To tackle the problem, this study develops a metamaterial structure, referred to as a meta-structure, to tactically enhance the cumulative second harmonic S0 Lamb waves by converting the A0 mode components into S0 mode waves. Topology optimization is conducted to design the meta-structure, which is surface-mounted onto the structure under inspection, to achieve high-efficiency A0-to-S0 wave mode conversion. Through tuning the parameters and constraints of the optimization, the designed single-sided meta-structure breaks the structural symmetry in the thickness direction, while facilitating its practical implementation. Typical scenarios with different meta-structure materials are discussed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the strain amplitudes of the fundamental S0 mode waves can be increased by 60% with the deployment of the meta-structure, alongside an enhancement of the second harmonic S0 mode waves at different sensing distances. Finally, the designed meta-structure is fabricated via 3D printing technique and tested experimentally on an aluminum plate subjected to thermal aging treatment for monitoring the heating-induced microstructural changes inside the structure. Experimental results confirm an increase in the wave amplitudes of the linear S0 mode waves with the assistance of the meta-structure. The developed system improves the sensitivity of nonlinear Lamb wave-based monitoring methods in characterizing material microstructural changes, which shows great promise for detecting incipient damage in practical structural health monitoring applications.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2024-03-16", "authors": ["ZeLiu", "ShengboShan", "LiCheng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2024.107295"}

Current virus diagnostic tools are laborious and expensive, while requiring medically trained staff. Although user-friendly and cost-effective biosensors are utilized for virus detection, many of them rely on recognition elements that suffer major drawbacks. Herein, computationally designed epitope-imprinted polymers (eIPs) are conjugated with a portable piezoelectric sensing platform to establish a sensitive and robust biosensor for the human pathogenic adenovirus (HAdV). The template epitope is selected from the knob part of the HAdV capsid, ensuring surface accessibility. Computational simulations are performed to evaluate the conformational stability of the selected epitope. Further, molecular dynamics simulations are executed to investigate the interactions between the epitope and the different functional monomers for the smart design of eIPs. The HAdV epitope is imprinted via the solid-phase synthesis method to produce eIPs using in silico-selected ingredients.

The piezo-catalytic degradation of water pollutants is an emerging area of research in water purification technology. This review article focuses on piezoelectric polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer-based membranes and their nanocomposites for textile wastewater remediation. At the beginning of this article, the classification of piezoelectric materials is discussed. Among the various membrane-forming polymers, PVDF is a piezoelectric polymer discussed in detail due to its exceptional piezoelectric properties. Polyvinylidene difluoride can show excellent piezoelectric properties in the beta phase. Therefore, various methods of \u03b2-phase enhancement within the PVDF polymer and various factors that have a critical impact on its piezo-catalytic activity are briefly explained.

Smart implants have been proposed as a solution, but incorporating components for sensing, powering, processing, and communication increases device cost, size, and risk; hence, minimising onboard instrumentation is desirable. In this study, two wireless, battery-free smart implants were developed that used passive biotelemetry to measure fixation at the implant-cement interface of the tibial components. The sensing system comprised of a piezoelectric transducer and coil, with the transducer affixed to the superior surface of the tibial trays of both partial (PKR) and total knee replacement (TKR) systems.

To mitigate this issue, vibration isolation technology must be employed to reduce the transmission of micro-vibrations to payloads. In this paper, a novel active-passive hybrid isolation (APHI) system based on a strain sensor is proposed for high-precision space payloads, and corresponding theoretical and experimental studies are implemented. First, a theoretical analysis model of the APHI system is established using a two-degrees-of-freedom system, and an integral control method based on strain sensing is presented. Then, an electromagnetic damper, active piezoelectric actuator, and strain sensor are designed and manufactured. Finally, an APHI experimental system is implemented to validate the effectiveness of electromagnetic damping and strain-sensing active control. Additionally, the control effects of acceleration, displacement, and strain sensors are compared. The results demonstrate that strain sensors can achieve effective active damping control, and the control method based on strain sensors can effectively suppress the payload response while maintaining stability. Both displacement and strain sensors exhibit superior suppression effects compared with the acceleration sensor, with the strain sensor showing greater potential for practical engineering applications than the displacement sensor.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-03-13", "authors": ["QiweiGuo", "JianZhou", "LiangLi", "MinglongXu", "GuoanTang"], "doi": "10.3390/s24051649\n10.2514/1.12036\n10.1080/19479832.2023.2167874\n10.1016/j.asr.2024.01.020\n10.1016/j.cryogenics.2019.102982\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105592\n10.1115/1.1287031\n10.1016/j.mechatronics.2021.102706\n10.1088/0964-1726/20/8/085025\n10.1088/0964-1726/8/6/307\n10.1016/j.cja.2014.10.012\n10.1016/j.jsv.2016.07.021\n10.1016/j.jsv.2006.07.050\n10.1016/j.jsv.2017.01.002\n10.1007/s12206-017-1112-2\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.01.022\n10.1088/0964-1726/8/6/309\n10.1177/1045389X11433491\n10.1088/0964-1726/15/4/027\n10.1177/0954406215604335"}
{"title": "Intelligent, Flexible Artificial Throats with Sound Emitting, Detecting, and Recognizing Abilities.", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a notable rise in the number of patients afflicted with laryngeal diseases, including cancer, trauma, and other ailments leading to voice loss. Currently, the market is witnessing a pressing demand for medical and healthcare products designed to assist individuals with voice defects, prompting the invention of the artificial throat (AT). This user-friendly device eliminates the need for complex procedures like phonation reconstruction surgery. Therefore, in this review, we will initially give a careful introduction to the intelligent AT, which can act not only as a sound sensor but also as a thin-film sound emitter. Then, the sensing principle to detect sound will be discussed carefully, including capacitive, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and piezoresistive components employed in the realm of sound sensing. Following this, the development of thermoacoustic theory and different materials made of sound emitters will also be analyzed.

The study explicitly evaluates UW parameters' impact on heat generation, joint strength, and electrical properties, with a comprehensive understanding of the process dynamics and developing a predictive model applicable to smart textiles. The methodological approach involved designing and manufacturing an ultrasonic piezoelectric transducer using ABAQUS finite element analyses (FEA) software and constructing a UW machine for the current purpose. The full factorial design (FFD) approach was employed in experiments to systematically assess the influence of welding time, welding pressure, and copper wire diameter on the produced joints. Experimental data were meticulously collected, and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model was constructed based on the analysis of these results. The results of the experimental investigation provided valuable insights into the UW process, elucidating the intricate relationship between welding parameters and heat generation, joint strength, and post-welding electrical properties of the copper wires.

{"title": "Wind-Speed-Adaptive Resonant Piezoelectric Energy Harvester for Offshore Wind Energy Collection.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a wind-speed-adaptive resonant piezoelectric energy harvester for offshore wind energy collection (A-PEH). The device incorporates a coil spring structure, which sets the maximum threshold of the output rotational frequency, allowing the A-PEH to maintain a stable output rotational frequency over a broader range of wind speeds. When the maximum output excitation frequency of the A-PEH falls within the sub-resonant range of the piezoelectric beam, the device becomes wind-speed-adaptive, enabling it to operate in a sub-resonant state over a wider range of wind speeds. Offshore winds exhibit an annual average speed exceeding 5.5 m/s with significant variability. Drawing from the characteristics of offshore winds, a prototype of the A-PEH was fabricated. The experimental findings reveal that in wind speed environments, the device has a startup wind speed of 4 m/s, and operates in a sub-resonant state when the wind speed exceeds 6 m/s. At this point, the A-PEH achieves a maximum open-circuit voltage of 40 V and an average power of 0.64 mW.

{"title": "Ultra-Thin Ion Exchange Membranes by Low Ionomer Blending for Energy Harvesting.", "abstract": "Exploring the utilization of ion exchange membranes (IEMs) in salinity gradient energy harvesting, a technique that capitalizes on the salinity difference between seawater and freshwater to generate electricity, this study focuses on optimizing PVDF to Nafion ratios to create ultra-thin membranes. Specifically, our investigation aligns with applications such as reverse electrodialysis (RED), where IEMs facilitate selective ion transport across salinity gradients. We demonstrate that membranes with reduced Nafion content, particularly the 50:50 PVDF:Nafion blend, retain high permselectivity comparable to those with higher Nafion content. This challenges traditional understandings of membrane design, highlighting a balance between thinness and durability for energy efficiency. Voltage-current analyses reveal that, despite lower conductivity, the 50:50 blend shows superior short-circuit current density under salinity gradient conditions. This is attributed to effective ion diffusion facilitated by the blend's unique microstructure. These findings suggest that blended membranes are not only cost-effective but also exhibit enhanced performance for energy harvesting, making them promising candidates for sustainable energy solutions.

{"title": "Bioinspired Dielectric Nanocomposites with High Charge-Discharge Efficiency Enabled by Superspreading-Induced Alignment of Nanosheets.", "abstract": "High-performance dielectric nanocomposites are promising candidates for thin-film dielectric capacitors for high-power pulse devices. However, the existing nanocomposites suffer from low charge-discharge efficiency (\u03b7), which results in severe generation and accumulation of Joule heat and subsequently the failure of the devices. In this work, we report nacre-inspired dielectric nanocomposites with outstanding \u03b7, which are enabled by superspreading shear flow-induced highly aligned two-dimensional (2D) nanofillers. Taking boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) as an example, the highly aligned BNNS in the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based nanocomposites contributes to a highly efficient Coulomb blockade effect for the injected charge carriers. Therefore, the bioinspired nanocomposites with highly aligned BNNS show significantly reduced dielectric loss (tan \u03b4) (63.3%) and improved \u03b7 (144.8%), compared to the ones with partially aligned nanosheets fabricated by solution casting. Furthermore, the optimized loading content of BNNS is as low as 3.6 wt %.

In this experiment, electrospun nanofibers were mixed with highly conductive nanoparticles and coated with polyaniline to detect the patient's electrical signals. Due to the high piezoelectric effect, nanofiber-based sensors do not require charging through a separate battery, so they can be used as self-powered devices. In addition, the LCR meter test confirmed that the sensor has a high capacitance due to its high conductivity and high sensitivity to electrical signals. The sensor produced in this study can visually estimate the electrical signal of the actual human body through real-time comparison with electromyography (EMG) measuring equipment, and it was confirmed that the error is small.

Herein, a type of hypercrosslinked metal-organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) membranes formed by covalent crosslinking of boronic acid-modified Zr-based MOPs with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are rationally designed. In these membranes, MOPs serve as high-connectivity nodes and provide dynamic borate bonds with PVA in hypercrosslinked networks, which can be broken/formed reversibly upon the stimulus of water vapor. The humidity response characteristic of HCMOPs promotes their self-oscillating and self-healing properties. HCMOP membranes can realize a self-oscillating property above the water surface even after loading a cargo that is 1.5 times the weight of the membrane due to the fast adsorption and desorption kinetics. Finally, the HCMOP actuator can realize energy conversion from mechanical energy into electricity when coupled with a piezoelectric membrane.

The device is integrated with a real-time piezo-actuated particle sorter based on user-defined multi-frequency impedance signatures. Biomass profiling of Cytodex-3 microcarriers seeded with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) is first performed to sort well-seeded or confluent microcarriers for downstream culture or harvesting, respectively. Next, impedance-based isolation of microcarriers with osteogenic differentiated ADSCs is demonstrated, which is validated with a twofold increase of calcium content in sorted ADSCs.

{"title": "Analysis of Cleavage Activity of Dengue Virus Protease by Co-transfections.", "abstract": "The genome of the dengue virus codes for a single polypeptide that yields three structural and seven non-structural (NS) proteins upon post-translational modifications. Among them, NS protein-3 (NS3) possesses protease activity, involved in the processing of the self-polypeptide and in the cleavage of host proteins. Identification and analysis of such host proteins as substrates of this protease facilitate the development of specific drugs. In vitro cleavage analysis has been applied, which requires homogeneously purified components. However, the expression and purification of both S3 and erythroid differentiation regulatory factor 1 (EDRF1) are difficult and unsuccessful on many occasions. EDRF1 was identified as an interacting protein of dengue virus protease (NS3). The amino acid sequence analysis indicates the presence of NS3 cleavage sites in this protein. As EDRF1 is a high-molecular-weight (~138 kDa) protein, it is difficult to express and purify the complete protein. In this protocol, we clone the domain of the EDRF1 protein (C-terminal end) containing the cleavage site and the NS3 into two different eukaryotic expression vectors containing different tags. These recombinant vectors are co-transfected into mammalian cells. The cell lysate is subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting with anti-tag antibodies. Data suggest the disappearance of the EDRF1 band in the lane co-transfected along with NS3 protease but present in the lane transfected with only EDRF1, suggesting EDRF1 as a novel substrate of NS3 protease. This protocol is useful in identifying the substrates of viral-encoded proteases using ex vivo conditions. Further, this protocol can be used to screen anti-protease molecules. Key features \u2022 This protocol requires the cloning of protease and substrate into two different eukaryotic expression vectors with different tags. \u2022 Involves the transfection and co-transfection of both the above recombinant vectors individually and together. \u2022 Involves western blotting of the same PVDF membrane containing total proteins of the cell lysate with two different antibodies. \u2022 Does not require purified proteins for the analysis of cleavage of any suspected substrate by the protease.", "journal": "Bio-protocol", "date": "2024-03-11", "authors": ["LekhaGandhi", "MusturiVenkataramana"], "doi": "10.21769/BioProtoc.4946"}

Among wastewater treatment technologies, in the view of development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes, membrane adsorption has proved to be a fast and simple method in the removal of pollutants, offering great contaminants recovery percentages, fast adsorbent regeneration and recycle, and easy scale-up. Due to their large surface area and tunable chemistry, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based materials revealed to be extraordinary adsorbents, exceeding by far performances of ordinary organic and inorganic membranes such as polyethersulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytetrafluoroethylene, ceramics, currently employed in membrane technologies for wastewater treatment. In consideration of this, the review aims to summarize recent developments in the field of carbon nanotubes-based materials for pollutants recovery from water through adsorption processes. After a brief introduction concerning what adsorption phenomenon is and how it is performed and governed by using carbon nanotubes-based materials, the review discusses into detail the employment of three common typologies of CNTs-based materials (CNTs powders, CNTs-doped polymeric membranes and CNTs membranes) in adsorption process for the removal of water pollutants. Particularly focus will be devoted on the emergent category of self-standing CNTs membranes (buckypapers), made entirely of carbon nanotubes, exhibiting superior performances than CNTs and CNTs-doped polymeric membranes in terms of preparation strategy, recovery percentages of pollutants and regeneration possibilities.

However, conventional designs are limited by the single working frequency, restricting their conformal ablation ability (i.e. ablation size and shape controllability).\nNew multi-frequency ultrasonic transducer design method is proposed based on the asymmetric backing layer, which divides the transducer into non-backing-layer region (i.e. front-piezoelectric region) and backing-layer region (i.e. front-piezoelectric-backing region) with multiple local thickness mode resonant frequencies. Ablation zone can be controlled by exciting the local resonance within or between the regions, and its control flexibility is further enhanced by driven under a multi-frequency modulation signal. Experiments and calculations are combined for verifying the proposal.\nThe fabricated transducer with a Y-direction asymmetric backing layer shows five resonances, with two in each region and one resonance excited in both regions. Spatial ultrasound emission is demonstrated by acoustic measurements. Tissue ablation experiments verified spatial ablation zone control, and frequency modulation driving method enables the spatial transition of ablation zone from one region to the other, generating different ablation sizes and shapes.

Our software implements the digital generation of various types of error signals, from an analog input through the application of loop filters of high complexity and real-time gain adjustment for multiple analog output signals, including different algorithms for resonance search, lock acquisition sequences, and in-loop gain optimization. Furthermore, all necessary diagnostic instruments, such as an oscilloscope, a network analyzer, and a spectrum analyzer, are integrated into our software. Apart from providing a quickly scalable, automatic feedback controller, the lock performance that can be achieved by using PyRPL with imperfect equipment, such as piezoelectric transducers and noisy amplifiers, is better than the one achievable with standard analog controllers due to the higher complexity of implementable filters and possibilities of nonlinear operations in the FPGA. This drastically reduces the cost of added complexity when introducing additional feedback loops to an experiment. The open-source character also distinguishes PyRPL from commercial solutions, as it allows users to customize functionalities at various levels, ranging from the easy integration of PyRPL-based feedback controllers into existing setups to the modification of the FPGA functionality.

Here, we develop cell-sized 20 \u03bcm-diameter silica-based piezoelectric magnetic Janus microparticles (PEMPs), enabling clinically-relevant high-frequency neural stimulation of primary neurons under low-intensity focused ultrasound. Owing to its functionally anisotropic design, half of the PEMP acts as a piezoelectric electrode via conjugated barium titanate nanoparticles to induce electrical stimulation, while the nickel-gold nanofilm-coated magnetic half provides spatial and orientational control on neural stimulation via external uniform rotating magnetic fields.

The thin-film sensor was directly deposited on a titanium alloy bolt head with radio frequency magnetron sputtering and characterized by a scanning electron microscope and an atomic force microscope. The ultrasonic characteristics of the smart bolt, which include a pure and broad frequency spectrum peaked at 14.81\u00a0MHz, high measurement accuracy below 3%, and high repeatability free from some interference from bolt detection position change, were fully characterized. No obvious frequency shift was observed with the increase in axial preload. Based on the mono-wave method [TOF (time of flight) of longitudinal mode wave], TOF change increased linearly with preload force in the range of 0-20\u00a0kN. With the increase in temperature from 22 to 150\u00a0\u00b0C, the TOF linearly increases while the longitudinal wave velocity linearly decreases.

However, most of the multiferroic magnetoelectric systems studied so far are based on materials that are not compatible with industrial processes. Doped hafnia is emerging as one of the few CMOS-compatible ferroelectric materials. Thus, it is highly relevant to study the integration of ferroelectric hafnia into multiferroic systems. In particular, ferroelectricity in hafnia, and the eventual magnetoelectric coupling when ferromagnetic layers are grown atop of it, are very much dependent on quality of interfaces. Since magnetic metals frequently exhibit noticeable reactivity when grown onto oxides, it is expected that ferroelectricity and magnetoelectricity might be reduced in multiferroic hafnia-based structures.

{"title": "High resolution and large measurement range voltage sensing based on an optoelectronic oscillator utilizing an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer.", "abstract": "A voltage sensor with high resolution and large measurement range based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The key component in the cavity to select the oscillating signal is a finite impulse response (FIR)-microwave photonic filter (MPF) which consists of a sinusoidal broadband optical signal, an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a section of dispersion compensating fiber, and a photodetector. The center frequency of the FIR-MPF is mainly determined by the free spectral range (FSR) of the FIR-MPF. In the lower arm of the MZI, a cylindrical piezoelectric ceramic (PZT) wrapped with a section of optical fiber acts as voltage sensing head. Due to the inverse piezoelectric effect of PZT, the variation of the voltage will cause radial deformation of the cylindrical PZT and then lead to the change of the FSR of the MZI, determining the shift of center frequency of FIR-MPF as well as the frequency of the oscillating signal of the OEO. Thus, by monitoring the shift of the oscillation frequency of the OEO using an electric spectrum analyzer or a digital signal processor, a high-speed interrogation and high-resolution voltage measurement can be realized. Additionally, in the proposed scheme, an infinite impulse response (IIR)-MPF consisting of a fiber ring resonator is cascaded with the FIR-MPF to ensure the single-mode oscillation of the OEO. The experimental results show that a total range of 1700 V voltage sensing from - 200\u2005V to 1500\u2005V is accomplished with the voltage sensitivity of 0.25\u2005GHz/100\u2005V and the resolution of 0.3\u2005V. By adjusting the proportion of the length of single mode fiber between two branches of MZI, the impact of temperature can be greatly reduced.

Using the widely-used gas isoflurane and injectable ketamine/xylazine combination, we also demonstrate that changes in respiratory rate are more easily detected and can precede changes in heart rate associated with variations in anesthetic depth.

Therefore, the characterization of the biomechanical properties of tissues with high spatial resolution provides valuable insights into a broad variety of developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes within living organisms. The biomechanical properties of the basement membrane (BM), an extracellular matrix (ECM) substructure measuring only \u223c100-400 nm across, are, among other things, pivotal to tumor progression and metastasis formation. Although the precise assignment of the Young's modulus E of such a thin ECM substructure especially in between two cell layers is still challenging, biomechanical data of the BM can provide information of eminent diagnostic potential. Here we present a detailed protocol to quantify the elastic modulus of the BM in murine and human lung tissue, which is one of the major organs prone to metastasis. This protocol describes a streamlined workflow to determine the Young's modulus E of the BM between the endothelial and epithelial cell layers shaping the alveolar wall in lung tissues using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our step-by-step protocol provides instructions for murine and human lung tissue extraction, inflation of these tissues with cryogenic cutting medium, freezing and cryosectioning of the tissue samples, and AFM force-map recording. In addition, it guides the reader through a semi-automatic data analysis procedure to identify the pulmonary BM and extract its Young's modulus E using an in-house tailored user-friendly AFM data analysis software, the Center for Applied Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine processing toolbox, which enables automatic loading of the recorded force maps, conversion of the force versus piezo-extension curves to force versus indentation curves, calculation of Young's moduli and generation of Young's modulus maps, where the pulmonary BM can be identified using a semi-automatic spatial filtering tool.

We present the detailed vibrational noise analysis of the hybrid vibration isolation system, which shows that the vibration level can be suppressed below 10-8 m/sec/\u221aHz for most frequencies up to 100\u00a0Hz. Combined with a rigid STM design, vibrational noise can be successfully removed from the tunneling current.

After cross-linking with POMs through the new IP reaction, the modified composite membrane showed improved hydrophilicity, water flux, and salt rejection. In the humic acid fouling experiment, the POMs-modified membrane exhibited the best antifouling performance, with a flux recovery rate of up to 91.3%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was further used to investigate the antifouling performance of the membranes. Nyquist and Bode plots of the POMs-modified membranes showed no significant change before and after fouling compared to the PVDF membrane substrate, indicating reduced fouling attachment on the modified membrane, which was consistent with the fouling index and flux variation observed during the fouling experiment.

Thus, this system is primed with mechanosensory structures that respond and adapt to changes in mechanical stimuli.

These have been proposed as the long-sought-after mechanosensitive excitatory channels involved in touch and proprioception in mammals. However, more and more pieces of evidence point to the importance of PIEZO channels in cardiovascular activities and disease development. PIEZO channel-related cardiac functions include transducing hemodynamic forces in endothelial and vascular cells, red blood cell homeostasis, platelet aggregation, and arterial blood pressure regulation, among others. PIEZO channels contribute to pathological conditions including cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension and congenital syndromes such as generalized lymphatic dysplasia and xerocytosis.

{"title": "Adhesive Porosity Analysis of Composite Adhesive Joints Using Ultrasonic Guided Waves.", "abstract": "Adhesively bonded composite joints can develop voids and porosity during fabrication, leading to stress concentration and a reduced load-carrying capacity. Hence, adhesive porosity analysis during the fabrication is crucial to ensure the required quality and reliability. Ultrasonic-guided wave (UGW)-based techniques without advanced signal processing often provide low-resolution imaging and can be ineffective for detecting small-size defects. This article proposes a damage imaging process for adhesive porosity analysis of bonded composite plates using UGWs measured by scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). To implement this approach, a piezoelectric transducer is mounted on the composite joint specimen to generate UGWs, which are measured over a densely sampled area. The signals obtained from the scan are processed using the proposed signal processing in different domains. Through the utilization of filter banks in frequency and wavenumber domains, along with the root-mean-square calculation of filtered signals, damage images of the adhesive region are obtained. It has been observed that different filters provide information related to different void sizes. Combining all the images reconstructed by filters, a final image is obtained which contains damages of various sizes. The images obtained by the proposed method are verified by radiography results and the porosity analysis is presented. The results indicate that the proposed methodology can detect the pores with the smallest detectable pore area of 2.41 mm2, corresponding to a radius of 0.88 mm, with an overall tendency to overestimate the pore size by an average of 11%.", "journal": "IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control", "date": "2024-02-29", "authors": ["MohsenBarzegar", "YevgeniyaLugovtsova", "JannisBulling", "TatianaMishurova", "Dario JPasadas", "Artur LRibeiro", "Helena GRamos"], "doi": "10.1109/TUFFC.2024.3371671"}

{"title": "Piezo inkjet formation of Ag nanoparticles from microdots arrays for surface plasmonic resonance.", "abstract": "The study aims to explore a novel approach for fabricating plasmonic nanostructures to enhance the optical properties and performance of various optoelectronic devices. The research begins by employing a piezo-inkjet printing technique to deposit drops containing Ag nanoparticles (NPs) onto a glass substrate at a predefined equidistance, with the goal of obtaining arrays of Ag microdots (Ag-\u00b5dots) on the glass substrate. This process is followed by a thermal annealing treatment. The printing parameters are first optimized to achieve uniform deposition of different sizes of Ag-\u00b5dots arrays by controlling the number of Ag ink drops. Subsequently, the printed arrays undergo thermal annealing at various temperatures in air for 60\u00a0min, enabling precise and uniform control over nanoparticle formation. The printed Ag nanoparticles are characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to analyze their morphological features, ensuring their suitability for plasmonic applications. UV-Vis spectrophotometry is employed to investigate the enhanced surface-plasmonic-resonance properties of the printed AgNPs. Measurements confirm that the equidistant arrays of AgNPs obtained from annealing Ag microdots exhibit enhanced light-matter interaction, leading to a surface plasmon resonance response dependent on the Ag NPs' specific surface area.

{"title": "Osteo-inductive effect of piezoelectric stimulation from the poly(l-lactic acid) scaffolds.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric biomaterials can generate piezoelectrical charges in response to mechanical activation. These generated charges can directly stimulate bone regeneration by triggering signaling pathway that is important for regulating osteogenesis of cells seeded on the materials. On the other hand, mechanical forces applied to the biomaterials play an important role in bone regeneration through the process called mechanotransduction. While mechanical force and electrical charges are both important contributing factors to bone tissue regeneration, they operate through different underlying mechanisms. The utilizations of piezoelectric biomaterials have been explored to serve as self-charged scaffolds which can promote stem cell differentiation and the formation of functional bone tissues. However, it is still not clear how mechanical activation and electrical charge act together on such a scaffold and which factors play more important role in the piezoelectric stimulation to induce osteogenesis. In our study, we found Poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA)-based piezoelectric scaffolds with higher piezoelectric charges had a more pronounced osteoinductive effect than those with lower charges. This provided a new mechanistic insight that the observed osteoinductive effect of the piezoelectric PLLA scaffolds is likely due to the piezoelectric stimulation they provide, rather than mechanical stimulation alone.

Renewable energy-driven catalytic advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) represent a green, sustainable, and environmentally friendly approach to meet the demands of environmental remediation. In this context, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) piezoelectric materials, with their non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, exhibit unique features. They create dipole polarization, inducing a built-in electric field that generates polarized holes and electrons and triggers redox reactions, thereby facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species for wastewater pollutant remediation. A broad spectrum of 2D TMDCs piezoelectric materials have been explored in self-integrated Fenton-like processes and persulfate activation processes. These materials offer a more simplistic and practical method than traditional approaches. Consequently, this review highlights recent advancements in 2D TMDCs piezoelectric catalysts and their roles in wastewater pollutant remediation through piezocatalytic-driven AOPs, such as Fenton-like processes and sulfate radicals-based oxidation processes.", "journal": "Chemosphere", "date": "2024-02-26", "authors": ["WinThi Yein", "QunWang", "Dong-SuKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141524"}

These sensor nodes play a crucial role in structural health monitoring, providing essential data on external conditions that can affect the health and performance of structures. We investigate the feasibility and efficiency of utilizing piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters to sustainably power environmental wireless sensor nodes on the one hand. On the other hand, we exploit different approaches to minimize the sensor node's power consumption and maximize its efficiency. The investigations consider various sensor node platforms and assess their performance under different voltage levels and broadcast frequencies. The findings reveal that optimized harvester designs enable real-time data broadcasting with short intervals, ranging from 1 to 3 s, expanding the horizons of environmental monitoring, and show that in case the system includes a battery as a backup plan, the battery's lifetime can be extended up to 9 times. This work underscores the potential of vibration energy harvesting as a viable solution for powering sensor nodes, enhancing their autonomy, and reducing maintenance costs in remote and challenging environments.

To overcome this, this study explores the application of ultrasonic guided waves, specifically utilising a limited number of cost-effective and unobtrusive Piezoelectric Wafer Active Sensors (PWAS). Employing COMSOL multiphysics, wave propagation is simulated through a simplified PCB while systematically varying the temperature of both components and the board itself. Machine learning algorithms are used to identify hotspots at component positions using a minimal number of sensors. An accuracy of 97.6% is achieved with four sensors, decreasing to 88.1% when utilizing a single sensor in a pulse-echo configuration. The proposed methodology not only provides sufficient spatial resolution to identify hotspots but also offers a non-invasive and efficient solution.

{"title": "A Review of Polymer-Based Environment-Induced Nanogenerators: Power Generation Performance and Polymer Material Manipulations.", "abstract": "Natural environment hosts a considerable amount of accessible energy, comprising mechanical, thermal, and chemical potentials. Environment-induced nanogenerators are nanomaterial-based electronic chips that capture environmental energy and convert it into electricity in an environmentally friendly way. Polymers, characterized by their superior flexibility, lightweight, and ease of processing, are considered viable materials. In this paper, a thorough review and comparison of various polymer-based nanogenerators were provided, focusing on their power generation principles, key materials, power density and stability, and performance modulation methods. The latest developed nanogenerators mainly include triboelectric nanogenerators (TriboENG), piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG), thermoelectric nanogenerators (ThermoENG), osmotic power nanogenerator (OPNG), and moist-electric generators (MENG). Potential practical applications of polymer-based nanogenerator were also summarized. The review found that polymer nanogenerators can harness a variety of energy sources, with the basic power generation mechanism centered on displacement/conduction currents induced by dipole/ion polarization, due to the non-uniform distribution of physical fields within the polymers. The performance enhancement should mainly start from strengthening the ion mobility and positive/negative ion separation in polymer materials. The development of ionic hydrogel and hydrogel matrix composites is promising for future nanogenerators and can also enable multi-energy collaborative power generation. In addition, enhancing the uneven distribution of temperature, concentration, and pressure induced by surrounding environment within polymer materials can also effectively improve output performance.

{"title": "A PEGylated PVDF Antifouling Membrane Prepared by Grafting of Methoxypolyethylene Glycol Acrylate in Gama-Irradiated Homogeneous Solution.", "abstract": "In this study, methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylate (mPEGA) served as a PEGylated monomer and was grafted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) through homogeneous solution gamma irradiation. The grafting process was confirmed using several techniques, including infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermodynamic stability assessments, and rotational viscosity measurements. The degree of grafting (DG) was determined via the gravimetric method. By varying the monomer concentration, a range of DGs was achieved in the PVDF-g-mPEGA copolymers. Investigations into water contact angles and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated a direct correlation between increased hydrophilicity, membrane porosity, and higher DG levels in the PVDF-g-mPEGA membrane. Filtration tests demonstrated that enhanced DGs resulted in more permeable PVDF-g-mPEGA membranes, eliminating the need for pore-forming agents.

Addressing these issues requires innovative solutions, with the integration of LD materials with polymers, ceramics, metals, and other porous materials proving a key strategy to significantly enhance piezoelectric properties. This review comprehensively covers recent advances in synthesizing and characterizing piezoelectric composites based on LD materials and porous materials. The synergistic combination of LD materials with other substances, especially porous materials, demonstrates notable performance improvements, addressing inherent challenges. The review also explores future directions and challenges in developing these composite materials, highlighting potential applications across various technological domains.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["XiaoqiangLuo", "QingbinLi", "YichaoWang"], "doi": "10.3390/ma17040844\n10.1039/D1CS00844G\n10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02258\n10.1021/acsanm.2c01871\n10.1002/adfm.202307348\n10.1021/acsami.0c16039\n10.1142/S2010135X21500132\n10.1080/19475411.2021.1880491\n10.1080/19475411.2022.2091058\n10.1038/s41699-018-0063-5\n10.1002/smll.201802091\n10.1016/j.euromechsol.2022.104731\n10.1016/j.compstruct.2022.116639\n10.1039/D2NR05926F\n10.1021/acsami.2c19154\n10.1016/j.scib.2021.02.007\n10.1021/acsami.3c07198\n10.1002/anie.201411335\n10.1002/adma.202000006\n10.1088/1361-6641/aa5cfb\n10.1039/D2NR01135B\n10.1063/1.2093925\n10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.05.155\n10.1016/j.mtener.2023.101457\n10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00058-9\n10.1021/acsami.6b04041\n10.1038/s41467-023-39692-y\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.024\n10.1021/jz3012436\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b02198\n10.1016/j.mtnano.2018.11.006\n10.1002/admi.201801167\n10.1016/j.matlet.2023.134040\n10.1007/s10854-017-7491-4\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c01827\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01907\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103974\n10.1002/smll.201503605\n10.1002/adma.201405826\n10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c02199\n10.1007/s12274-015-0959-8\n10.1039/C8TA05887C\n10.1021/acsami.9b12187\n10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.073\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.04.029\n10.1088/0960-1317/23/12/125037\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.01.243\n10.1021/nn5013429\n10.1039/C4NR04713C\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.05.022\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.05.032\n10.1140/epjb/e2018-90297-y\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.012\n10.1038/nnano.2012.69\n10.1016/j.mehy.2017.07.021\n10.1021/acsami.7b04323\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.142\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.037"}

The rapid growth of the PV industry will lead to a sharp increase in the waste generated from PV panels. However, electro-waste can be successfully used as a source of secondary materials. In this study, a unique procedure for recycling PV modules was developed. In the first stage, the aluminum frame and junction box, 18wt%. and 1wt%. of the module, respectively, were removed. The following stage was crucial, involving a mechanical-thermal method to remove the glass, which accounts for 70wt%. As a result, only 11wt%. of the initial mass of the PV was subjected to the next stage of chemical delamination, which reduced the amount of solvent used. Toluene was used to swell the ethylene vinyl acetate, EVA, and allow for the separation of the PV module. The effects of temperature and ultrasound on separation time were investigated.

This article explores an innovative approach using intelligent materials to enhance condition-based maintenance, ultimately cutting life-cycle costs. The study emphasizes a paradigm shift toward structural health monitoring (SHM), utilizing embedded sensors for real-time monitoring.

The work evaluates passive sensing through acoustic emission (AE) signals and active sensing using Lamb wave propagation, presenting amplitude-based and frequency domain approaches for damage detection. A comprehensive signal processing approach is presented, and the damage index and damage size correlation function are introduced to enable continuous monitoring due to their sensitivity to changes in material properties and defect severity.

{"title": "Flexible Toolbox of High-Precision Microfluidic Modules for Versatile Droplet-Based Applications.", "abstract": "Although the enormous potential of droplet-based microfluidics has been successfully demonstrated in the past two decades for medical, pharmaceutical, and academic applications, its inherent potential has not been fully exploited until now. Nevertheless, the cultivation of biological cells and 3D cell structures like spheroids and organoids, located in serially arranged droplets in micro-channels, has a range of benefits compared to established cultivation techniques based on, e.g., microplates and microchips. To exploit the enormous potential of the droplet-based cell cultivation technique, a number of basic functions have to be fulfilled. In this paper, we describe microfluidic modules to realize the following basic functions with high precision: (i) droplet generation, (ii) mixing of cell suspensions and cell culture media in the droplets, (iii) droplet content detection, and (iv) active fluid injection into serially arranged droplets. The robustness of the functionality of the Two-Fluid Probe is further investigated regarding its droplet generation using different flow rates. Advantages and disadvantages in comparison to chip-based solutions are discussed. New chip-based modules like the gradient, the piezo valve-based conditioning, the analysis, and the microscopy module are characterized in detail and their high-precision functionalities are demonstrated. These microfluidic modules are micro-machined, and as the surfaces of their micro-channels are plasma-treated, we are able to perform cell cultivation experiments using any kind of cell culture media, but without needing to use surfactants. This is even more considerable when droplets are used to investigate cell cultures like stem cells or cancer cells as cell suspensions, as 3D cell structures, or as tissue fragments over days or even weeks for versatile applications.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["MarioSaupe", "StefanWiedemeier", "GunterGastrock", "RobertR\u00f6mer", "KarenLemke"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15020250\n10.1002/elsc.201700008\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.898699\n10.1073/pnas.1915660117\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.589074\n10.1126/sciadv.abe3839\n10.3390/mi10060412\n10.1002/ceat.201200695\n10.1039/D0RA02470H\n10.1021/acsami.2c13156\n10.1073/pnas.1106752109\n10.1093/femsle/fny258\n10.3390/mi10110754\n10.3390/polym4031349\n10.3390/mi7120225\n10.1016/j.mne.2019.01.003\n10.1007/s10404-017-2005-5\n10.1039/D1LC00288K\n10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.06.067\n10.1007/s10853-021-06843-9\n10.1073/pnas.1606927113\n10.3389/fchem.2021.666867\n10.1002/advs.202000359\n10.1007/s10404-017-1902-y\n10.1002/wnan.1522\n10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.11.040\n10.1002/elsc.201700086\n10.1002/elsc.200800127\n10.3390/mi13081363\n10.3390/bios12121085\n10.1002/elsc.201000146\n10.1002/bit.28208\n10.3390/mi10120808\n10.1088/1361-6439/aa53ed\n10.1093/jnen/61.3.215\n10.2176/nmc.ra.2014-0229\n10.1038/s41598-017-14341-9\n10.1063/1.4972357\n10.1039/b702472j\n10.1039/C6LC01018K\n10.1371/journal.pone.0282563\n10.1038/s41378-020-0167-x\n10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.04.004\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.110606\n10.3390/foods12183385\n10.3390/mi12060590\n10.3390/inventions3030054\n10.1002/elps.201700374\n10.1002/anie.201602328\n10.1039/C7RA04494A\n10.21769/BioProtoc.3131\n10.1016/j.tca.2014.10.021\n10.1016/j.snb.2014.05.024\n10.1016/j.snb.2011.07.006\n10.1016/j.snb.2022.132688\n10.1002/cbic.200400321\n10.1007/s10404-012-1133-1\n10.1039/C8LC01182F\n10.3390/mi11040394\n10.1038/srep37671\n10.3390/mi5041002\n10.3390/mi9040160\n10.1002/aic.13945\n10.3390/mi11020130\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112649\n10.1007/s10404-015-1676-z\n10.1038/s41598-017-08831-z\n10.1038/s41598-021-02535-1\n10.3390/mi13050708\n10.3390/mi13101661"}

The signal is acquired layer by layer using 3D acoustic time-domain simulation, resulting in the collection of data from each of the 32 layers. The 1 \u00d7 256 ring array moves on a vertical trajectory from the chest wall to the nipple at a constant speed. A data set was collected at intervals of 1.5 mm, resulting in a total of 32 data sets. Surface rendering and volume rendering algorithms were used to reconstruct 3D ultrasound images from the volume data obtained via simulation so that the smallest simulated reconstructed lesion had a diameter of 0.3 mm. The reconstructed three-dimensional image derived from the experimental data exhibits the contour of the breast model along with its internal mass.

{"title": "Enhanced Performance of an Acoustofluidic Device by Integrating Temperature Control.", "abstract": "Acoustofluidics is an emerging research field wherein either mixing or (bio)-particle separation is conducted. High-power acoustic streaming can produce more intense and rapid flow patterns, leading to faster and more efficient liquid mixing. However, without cooling, the temperature of the piezoelectric element that is used to supply acoustic power to the fluid could rise above 50% of the Curie point of the piezomaterial, thereby accelerating its aging degradation. In addition, the supply of excessive heat to a liquid may lead to irreproducible streaming effects and gas bubble formation. To control these phenomena, in this paper, we present a feedback temperature control system integrated into an acoustofluidic setup using bulk acoustic waves (BAWs) to elevate mass transfer and manipulation of particles. The system performance was tested by measuring mixing efficiency and determining the average velocity magnitude of acoustic streaming. The results show that the integrated temperature control system keeps the temperature at the set point even at high acoustic powers and improves the reproducibility of the acoustofluidic setup performance when the applied voltage is as high as 200 V.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["MehrnazHashemiesfahan", "PierreGelin", "AntonioMaisto", "HanGardeniers", "WimDe Malsche"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15020191\n10.1038/s41378-019-0064-3\n10.1038/s41378-022-00435-6\n10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03786\n10.3791/53861\n10.1039/C6LC00150E\n10.1063/5.0134646\n10.1039/c3lc50568e\n10.1016/j.trac.2019.06.034\n10.1098/rsos.181776\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c00005\n10.1121/1.4939737\n10.3390/fluids3040108\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2023.106575\n10.3390/mi12080934\n10.3390/s18010299\n10.1017/CBO9781107338760\n10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.04.037\n10.1103/PhysRevE.74.041603\n10.1038/s41598-021-99863-z\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.04.145\n10.1002/elps.202200162\n10.1007/s10544-018-0257-9\n10.1016/j.ohx.2021.e00245\n10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.10.135\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.11.014047\n10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.11.016\n10.1007/s12206-021-0646-5\n10.1007/s10404-010-0694-0\n10.1016/j.cej.2019.03.004\n10.1038/s41378-020-00218-x\n10.3390/mi10120854\n10.1021/ac5007798\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.L051003\n10.1039/D2TB02338E\n10.1039/c1lc20637k\n10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.08.063\n10.1115/1.1643090\n10.1039/C9LC00211A\n10.3389/fphy.2023.1062433\n10.3390/mi13081337\n10.1103/PhysRevE.104.025104"}
{"title": "Increased PIEZO1 Expression Is Associated with Worse Clinical Outcomes in Hormone-Receptor-Negative Breast Cancer Patients.", "abstract": "PIEZO1 plays a crucial role in the human body as a mechanosensory ion channel. It has been demonstrated that PIEZO1 is important in tissue development and regulating many essential physiological processes. Studies have suggested that the PIEZO1 ion channel plays a role in invasion and progression in cancer; elevated levels of PIEZO1 have been correlated with increased migration in breast cancer cells, chemo-resistance and invasion in gastric cancer cells, and increased invasion of osteosarcoma cells. In addition, high PIEZO1 expression levels were correlated with a worse prognosis in glioma patients. On the other hand, studies in lung cancer have attributed high PIEZO1 levels to better patient outcomes. However, the clinical impact of PIEZO1 in breast cancer is not well characterized. Therefore, our goal was to determine the clinical relevance of PIEZO1 in breast cancer. An analysis of breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was conducted to investigate PIEZO1 expression levels and correlation to survival, followed by validation in an independent dataset, GSE3494. We also performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and pathway enrichment analysis. We also analyzed the immune cell composition in breast tumors from TCGA through a CIBERSORT algorithm. Our results demonstrated that the PIEZO1 expression levels are higher in hormone-receptor (HR)-negative than in HR-positive cohorts. High PIEZO1 expression is correlated with a significant decrease in survival in HR-negative cohorts, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), suggesting that PIEZO1 could be utilized as a prognostic biomarker in HR-negative breast cancer. GSEA showed that various signaling pathways associated with more invasive phenotypes and resistance to treatments, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and multiple signaling pathways, are enriched in high-PIEZO1 HR-negative tumors. Our results also demonstrated a decrease in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration in high-PIEZO1 HR-negative tumors. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanistic roles of PIEZO1 in HR-negative breast cancer.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["Rylee AnnPoole", "QingfeiWang", "AloRay", "KazuakiTakabe", "MateuszOpyrchal", "ErikoKatsuta"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers16040683\n10.3390/cells9010250\n10.1016/b978-0-12-394624-9.00008-7\n10.3390/cancers12071780\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1074/jbc.R114.612697\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1016/j.tibs.2021.01.008\n10.1038/nrm.2017.92\n10.1038/nature13701\n10.7554/eLife.47454\n10.1038/s41467-019-14146-6\n10.3390/ijms23179909\n10.1186/s12935-022-02574-2\n10.3390/cells10112815\n10.1152/ajpcell.00346.2018\n10.1111/jcmm.16217\n10.1038/s41586-019-1485-8\n10.3389/fimmu.2022.976482\n10.3390/cells11142191\n10.7554/eLife.52779\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.725275\n10.1007/s10620-014-3044-3\n10.1002/mc.22831\n10.12659/MSM.906959\n10.1038/srep08364\n10.1093/abbs/gmaa112\n10.1038/s41598-018-21061-1\n10.1172/JCI96268\n10.1038/nature25501\n10.1200/JCO.2010.30.5037\n10.1177/17588359211006680\n10.1038/s41598-020-72886-8\n10.1042/BSR20181679\n10.1097/CAD.0000000000001049\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0095\n10.1126/scisignal.2004088\n10.1093/database/baab007\n10.1007/s10549-011-1457-7\n10.1038/nmeth.3337\n10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110351\n10.1186/s12885-015-1121-4\n10.1186/s12943-019-1089-9\n10.3389/fcell.2022.805507\n10.1038/nrm3758\n10.1186/s12860-021-00401-6\n10.1038/s41467-022-30362-z\n10.1101/gad.314617.118\n10.1186/s13046-020-01586-y"}

These materials, particularly those with electrical conductivity, are used to actively recreate the electromechanical nature of the cardiac tissue. In the present work, we describe a novel combination of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), a highly electroactive polymer, with graphene (G), exhibiting high electrical conductivity. G/P(VDF-TrFE) films have been characterized in terms of topographical, physico-chemical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, and studied the response of cardiomyocytes adhering to them. The results indicate that the crystallinity and the wettability of the composites remain almost unaffected after G incorporation. In turn, surface roughness, Young modulus, and electric properties are higher in G/P(VDF-TrFE). Finally, the composites are highly biocompatible and able to support cardiomyocyte adhesion and proliferation, particularly surface treated ones, demonstrating the suitability of these materials for cardiac tissue engineering applications.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["R MMeira", "SRibeiro", "IIrastorza", "USilv\u00e1n", "SLanceros-Mendez", "CRibeiro"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2024.02.139"}
{"title": "Full instantaneous de-icing using extensional modes: The role of architectured and multilayered materials in modes decoupling.", "abstract": "Ultrasonic de-icing systems are energy-efficient solutions for ice protection. The systems generate high levels of stress in the ice by inducing vibrations in the substrate, resulting in bulk or adhesive ice failure and, ultimately, ice removal. For this purpose, two types of resonant modes can be excited: flexural and extensional modes. The extensional modes have the interesting ability to de-ice substantial areas of the underlying surface as long as they are pure and do not interfere with the flexural modes. However, the coupling between extensional and flexural modes occurs naturally for thin ice-covered substrates. The inertial effect that explains this coupling is demonstrated in this paper by means of the Euler-Lagrange approach. The Euler-Lagrange model also shows how the inertial effect can be eliminated by carefully adjusting the ratio of Young's modulus to substrate density to be close to that of ice. Finally, the paper details how multilayered or architectured materials can be used to design piezoelectric plate-like structures to achieve pure extensional modes for de-icing. The ultrasonic de-icing capabilities are demonstrated on prototypes covered with freezer ice.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2024-02-24", "authors": ["GGastaldo", "MBudinger", "YRafik", "VPommier-Budinger", "VPalanque", "AYaich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2024.107264"}

{"title": "Four-Channel Ultrasonic Sensor for Bulk Liquid and Biochemical Surface Interrogation.", "abstract": "Custom electronics tailored for ultrasonic applications with four ultrasonic transmit-receive channels and a nominal 25 MHz single channel frequency were developed for ultrasound BAW and SAW biosensor uses. The designed integrated microcontroller, supported by Python with a SciPy library, and the developed system measured the time of flight (TOF) and other wave properties to characterize the acoustic properties of a bulk of the liquid in a microchannel or acoustic properties of biological species attached to an analytic surface in real time. The system can utilize both piezoelectric and capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers. The device demonstrated a linear response to changes in water salinity. This response was primarily attributed to the time-of-flight (TOF) changes related to the varying solution density. Furthermore, real-time DNA oligonucleotide-based interactions between oligonucleotides immobilized on the device's analytical area and oligonucleotides attached to gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) in the solution were demonstrated. The biological interaction led to an exponential decrease in the acoustic interfacial wave propagating across the interface between the solution and the solid surface of the sensor, the TOF signal. This decrease was attributed to the increase in the effective density of the solution in the vicinity of the sensor's analytical area, as Au NPs modified by oligonucleotides were binding to the analytical area. The utilization of Au NPs in oligonucleotide surface binding yields a considerably stronger sensor signal than previously observed in earlier CMUT-based TOF biosensor prototypes.", "journal": "Biosensors", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["DonatasPelenis", "DovydasBarauskas", "MindaugasDzikaras", "DariusVir\u017eonis"], "doi": "10.3390/bios14020066\n10.3390/s22062135\n10.1063/1.3493046\n10.1109/19.126639\n10.1016/j.ultras.2006.05.046\n10.3390/pharmaceutics14061282\n10.1016/j.ndteint.2004.09.008\n10.3390/s22030820\n10.1021/acssensors.9b01869\n10.1016/j.sna.2021.112563\n10.3390/mi13010024\n10.1002/admt.202001018\n10.1016/j.bios.2014.04.027\n10.1016/j.aca.2023.340929\n10.1016/j.bios.2011.12.041\n10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.014\n10.1016/j.sna.2022.113438\n10.24425/bpasts.2020.133381\n10.1007/s10470-021-01963-3\n10.1007/s00542-023-05479-w\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112598\n10.1109/JSEN.2020.2988383\n10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00139\n10.35848/1347-4065/abea50\n10.1007/s00542-019-04326-1\n10.1109/TUFFC.2004.1304274\n10.1016/j.ultras.2019.105956\n10.3390/mi14051012\n10.1166/sl.2014.3348\n10.1016/0038-092X(90)90087-S\n10.3390/s19204395\n10.1109/TBCAS.2014.2349074\n10.1016/j.snr.2021.100041\n10.1016/j.snb.2018.01.122\n10.1002/pssa.202200760\n10.1039/D2SD00203E"}

{"title": "Motion-artifact-free single shot two-beam optical coherence elastography system.", "abstract": "The assessment of the biomechanical properties of the skin using various imaging techniques has been used as a diagnostic tool in dermatology. Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is one of the techniques that allows for the measurement of elastic properties. OCE relies on measuring tissue displacements induced by external sources. Measuring the tissue's mechanical properties \nThis study aimed to develop an OCE system that allows for minimizing the effects of bulk tissue movements. To achieve this, we designed a two-beam OCE system that simultaneously measures the tissue displacement at two locations on the sample. This allows for cancelling the effect of the tissue bulk movement, which is common to both measurement points.\nWe used a piezoelectric transducer to generate surface acoustic waves (SAW) in the sample. The velocity of the excited waves, which is proportional to the rigidity of the sample, was measured by calculating the phase delay of the SAW at two locations on the sample. Simultaneous measurement at two locations was achieved by dividing a single light beam into two by focusing on the sample at two different locations. The two beams travel different optical path lengths, and the reflected signals were depth encoded in a single optical coherence tomography scan using a single reference beam.\nThe system was characterized using different tissue-mimicking phantoms and the skin of healthy volunteers at the wrist and the palm. We achieved an approximately 50-fold increase in phase sensitivity measurement.\nWe designed a simple two-beam OCE system that effectively minimizes the effect of tissue movement.

{"title": "Piezo2 Contributes to Traumatic Brain Injury by Activating the RhoA/ROCK1 Pathways.", "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to short-term and long-term physical and cognitive impairments, which have significant impacts on patients, families, and society. Currently, treatment outcomes for this disease are often unsatisfactory, due at least in part to the fact that the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of TBI are largely unknown. Here, we observed significant upregulation of Piezo2, a key mechanosensitive ion channel protein, in the injured brain tissue of a mouse model of TBI induced by controlled cortical impact. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown of Piezo2 after TBI attenuated neuronal death, brain edema, brain tissue necrosis, and deficits in neural function and cognitive function. Mechanistically, the increase in Piezo2 expression contributed to TBI-induced neuronal death and subsequent production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, likely through activation of the RhoA/ROCK1 pathways in the central nervous system. Our findings suggest that Piezo2 is a key player in and a potential therapeutic target for TBI.", "journal": "Molecular neurobiology", "date": "2024-02-23", "authors": ["YinggangXiao", "YangZhang", "WenjuanYuan", "CunjinWang", "YaliGe", "TianfengHuang", "JuGao"], "doi": "10.1007/s12035-024-04058-y\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002332\n10.1016/s1474-4422(18)30469-1\n10.1056/NEJMoa1411090\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.01.008\n10.1517/13543784.2015.1021919\n10.1385/mn:28:3:229\n10.2174/1381612822666161027113200\n10.1097/ccm.0000000000003361\n10.1126/science.1193270\n10.1038/nn.4394\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1038/nature25743\n10.1038/s41586-019-1505-8\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aat9892\n10.1146/annurev-biochem-081720-023244\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1038/nn.2873\n10.1073/pnas.1718177115\n10.1016/j.neuron.2019.01.050\n10.7554/eLife.52779\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00235\n10.1002/glia.23171\n10.1038/nprot.2009.148\n10.1089/neu.2013.3255\n10.1172/jci.insight.166270\n10.1038/s41392-021-00748-4\n10.1515/med-2023-0701\n10.1172/jci.insight.139987\n10.1073/pnas.1507309112\n10.1074/jbc.M113.528638\n10.1007/s00424-014-1578-z\n10.1038/ncomms2673\n10.18632/oncotarget.10134\n10.3389/fneur.2019.00766\n10.1080/19336950.2017.1279370\n10.1016/j.phrs.2021.106045\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.11.010\n10.3390/cells9010245\n10.1089/neu.2013.3250\n10.1074/jbc.RA120.013623"}

To overcome the limitations in the current eye-tracking system and electrooculography, a piezoelectric arrayed sensor system is developed using single-crystalline III-N thin-film transducers, which offers advantages of mechanical flexibility, biocompatibility, and high electromechanical conversion, for continuous monitoring of oculomotor movements by skin-attachable, safe, and highly sensitive sensors. The flexible piezoelectric eye movement sensor array (F-PEMSA), consisting of three transducers, is attached to the face temple area where it can be comfortably wearable and can detect the muscles' activity associated with the eye motions. Output voltages from upper, mid, and lower sensors (transducers) on different temple areas generate discernable patterns of output voltage signals with different combinations of positive/negative signs and their relative magnitudes for the various movements of eyeballs including 8 directional (lateral, vertical, and diagonal) and two rotational movements, which enable various types of saccade and pursuit tests.

Herein, we construct a piezoelectric hydrogel to rescue the impaired osteogenic capability and rebuild the regenerative immune microenvironment through bioenergetic activation. Under local mechanical stress, the piezoelectric hydrogel generated piezopotential that initiates osteogenic differentiation of inflammatory periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) via modulating energy metabolism and promoting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Moreover, it also reshapes an anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative niche through switching M1 macrophages to the M2 phenotype.

{"title": "Suppression of the height deviation on metal bumps manufacturing by an ultrasonic vibration control.", "abstract": "On-demand droplet printing based on piezoelectric micro-jet device (PMJD) is considered a flexible and high-precision method to generate metal droplets directly for flip-chip bonding in industrial electronics. However, the quality of flip-chip bonding is closely related to the height deviation of the solidified droplets (the metal bumps), which is influenced by the complicated hydrodynamics of impacting and oscillation of the droplet with oxide film. Here, the numerical and experimental investigations are first conducted to study the effect of the liquid bridge and deposition parameters on the height deviation of the solidified droplets. The rapid oxidation of the liquid bridge and under-oscillation during the deposition process are the main reasons for height deviation. In addition, the undamped oscillation with high-speed impact and instantaneous solidification also deteriorates the height deviation. To this end, an oscillation control strategy based on ultrasonic-assisted metal droplet deposition (UAMDD) is proposed and verified to be a reliable regulation strategy to suppress the height deviation of the printed bumps. The effective regulating range of height deviation is studied experimentally by changing the ultrasonic vibration amplitude. Finally, a 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 array composed of 100 solidified metal droplets is printed with the UAMDD, which has the height deviation of 554\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u03bcm. And the dimensionless height deviation (\u0394h/h) of solidified bumps is stayed below 2.1\u00a0%.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2024-02-21", "authors": ["YumingFeng", "YingxiangLiu", "JieDeng", "JunkaoLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2024.107270"}

A total of 16 healthy participants performed 15 activities, representative of pulmonary rehabilitation exercises, simultaneously using all devices. Evaluation was performed based on detection of flow reversal events and key respiratory parameters.\nOverall, the proposed sensor outperformed the piezoelectric sensor with a mean ratio, precision, and recall of 0.97, 0.97, and 0.95, respectively, against 0.98, 0.90, and 0.88. Evaluation regarding the respiratory parameters indicates an adequate accuracy when it comes to breath cycle, inspiration, and expiration times, with mean relative errors around 4% for breath cycle and 8% for inspiration/expiration times, despite some variability. Bland-Altman analysis indicates no systematic biases.\nCharacterization of the proposed sensor shows adequate monitoring capabilities for exercises that do not rely heavily on torso mobility, but may present a limitation when it comes to activities such as side stretches.\nThis work provides a comprehensive characterization of a magnetic field-based respiration sensor, including a discussion on its robustness to different algorithm thresholds.

In this work, we propose a finite element model (FEM)-assisted lumped-parameters equivalent circuit for a fast and accurate modeling of these types of devices. The electro-mechanical parameters are derived from a pre-stressed FEM eigenfrequency analysis, to account for arbitrarily complex geometries and for the shift of the speaker resonance frequency due to an initial non-null pre-deflected configuration. The parameters of the acoustical circuit are instead computed through analytical formulas. The acoustic short-circuit between the speaker front and rear sides is taken into account through a proper air-gaps modeling. The very good matching in terms of radiated sound pressure level among the equivalent circuit predictions, FEM simulations, and experimental data proves the ability of the proposed method to accurately simulate the speaker performance.

The focus on biosensors that exploit the human body for energy-spanning wearable, attachable, and implantable variants has intensified, driven by their broad applicability in areas from underwater exploration to biomedical assays and earthquake monitoring.

Usually, piezoelectric thin films do not come into direct contact with the skin and need to be connected through a layer of an elastic medium. Most views think that the main function of this layer of elastic medium is to increase the adhesion between the sensor component and the skin, but there is little discussion about the impact of the elastic medium on pulse vibration transmission. Here, we conducted a detailed study on the effects of Young's modulus and the thickness of elastic media on pulse sensing signals. The results show that the waveform amplitude of the piezoelectric sensing signal decreases with the increase of Young's modulus and thickness of the elastic medium. Then, we constructed a theoretical model of the influence of elastic media on pulse wave propagation. The amplitude of the pulse wave signal detected by the optimized sensor was increased to 480%. Our research shows that by regulating Young's modulus and thickness of elastic media, pulse wave signals can undergo a similar amplification effect, which has an important theoretical reference value for achieving ambulatory blood pressure monitoring based on high-quality pulse waves.", "journal": "ACS sensors", "date": "2024-02-19", "authors": ["JiasiZhang", "PengruiZhu", "HanOuyang", "EnguiWang", "JiangtaoXue", "ZhouLi", "BojingShi", "YuboFan"], "doi": "10.1021/acssensors.3c02180"}

{"title": "MAGIC matrices: freeform bioprinting materials to support complex and reproducible organoid morphogenesis.", "abstract": "Organoids are powerful models of tissue physiology, yet their applications remain limited due to a lack of complex tissue morphology and high organoid-to-organoid structural variability. To address these limitations we developed a soft, composite yield-stress extracellular matrix that supports freeform 3D bioprinting of cell slurries at tissue-like densities. Combined with a custom piezoelectric printhead, this platform allows more reproducible and complex morphogenesis from uniform and spatially organized organoid \"seeds.\" At 4 \u00b0C the material exhibits reversible yield-stress behavior to support long printing times without compromising cell viability. When transferred to cell culture at 37 \u00b0C, the material cross-links and exhibits similar viscoelasticity and plasticity to basement membrane extracts such as Matrigel. We use this setup for high-throughput generation of intestinal and salivary gland organoid arrays that are morphologically indistinguishable from those grown in pure Matrigel, but exhibit dramatically improved homogeneity in organoid size, shape, maturation time, and budding efficiency.

However, most current scaffolds cannot respond to physical-chemical modifications of the cell microenvironment. Stimuli-responsive materials, such as electroactive smart polymers, are increasingly gaining attention once they can produce electrical potentials without external power supplies. The presence of piezoelectricity in human tissues like cartilage and bone highlights the importance of electrical stimulation in physiological conditions. Although poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is one of the piezoelectric polymers with the highest piezoelectric response, it is not biodegradable. Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is a promising copolymer of poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) for tissue engineering and regeneration applications. It offers biodegradability, piezoelectric properties, biocompatibility, and bioactivity, making it a superior option to PVDF for biomedical purposes requiring biodegradability. Magnetoelectric polymer composites can be made by combining magnetostrictive particles and piezoelectric polymers to further tune their properties for tissue regeneration. These composites convert magnetic stimuli into electrical stimuli, generating local electrical potentials for various applications. Cobalt ferrites (CFO) and piezoelectric polymers have been combined and processed into different morphologies, maintaining biocompatibility for tissue engineering. The present work studied how PHBV/CFO microspheres affected neural and glial response in spinal cord cultures. It is expected that the electrical signals generated by these microspheres due to their magnetoelectric nature could aid in tissue regeneration and repair. PHBV/CFO microspheres were not cytotoxic and were able to impact neurite outgrowth and promote neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, PHBV/CFO microspheres led to microglia activation and induced the release of several bioactive molecules. Importantly, magnetically stimulated microspheres ameliorated cell viability after an in vitro ROS-induced lesion of spinal cord cultures, which suggests a beneficial effect on tissue regeneration and repair.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2024-02-17", "authors": ["Tiffany SPinho", "Jorge RibeiroCibr\u00e3o", "DeolindaSilva", "SandraBarata-Antunes", "JonasCampos", "Jo\u00e3o LAfonso", "Bel\u00e9mSampaio-Marques", "ClarisseRibeiro", "Andr\u00e9 SMacedo", "PedroMartins", "Cristiana BCunha", "SenentxuLanceros-Mendez", "Ant\u00f3nio JSalgado"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2024.213798"}
{"title": "Package-Less Liquid Phase Sensing Using Surface Acoustic Waves on Lithium Tantalate Oxide.", "abstract": "Surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducers propagating shear waves are compatible with sensing chemical compounds in a liquid phase. However, if the liquid surrounding the sensor possesses a higher permittivity than the piezoelectric substrate, then the interdigitated electrodes for converting the incoming electromagnetic wave to acoustic waves are susceptible to capacitive short-circuiting, leading to excessive insertion losses. By using high-permittivity lithium tantalate oxide (LTO), we demonstrate chemical sensing in water without the need for dedicated microfluidic packaging. Nevertheless, the gravimetric sensitivity of these package-less transmission Love-mode delay lines remains comparable to that of low-permittivity quartz when appropriately tuning the guiding layer of thin film to confine energy to the surface in a Love mode. We extend the transmission line gravimetric sensitivity measurement to a reflective delay line geometry for passive transducers that can be wirelessly probed. For instance, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can be used for subsurface sensing, here targeting water pollution detection, operating in the 100-500-MHz range.

{"title": "Selective Recovery of Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium-Ion Battery Material with a Near-Room-Temperature Separation.", "abstract": "Effective separation of cathode materials from the current collector is a critical step in recycling a spent lithium-ion battery (LIB). This typically necessitates the decomposition or dissolution of the organic binder, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), to achieve efficient recovery of cathode materials. However, this process requires a high decomposition temperature, typically between 400 and 600 \u00b0C, and can lead to side reactions, such as current collector oxidation/brittleness, decomposition of cathode materials, and formation of metal fluorides. In this study, we propose that non-thermal plasma (NTP) treatment can be used to achieve an extremely high separation of cathode materials and aluminum current collector at near room temperature. Instead of relying on PVDF decomposition, which requires high temperatures, PVDF can be deactivated by partially breaking down long molecular chains with appropriate NTP conditions. With a total treatment time of around 2000 s and an environmental temperature of approximately 80 \u00b0C, minor side reactions can be avoided. The separation rate can reach up to 95.69%, and high-quality cathode materials can be obtained with only 0.02 wt % aluminum impurity content. This research could potentially offer a new approach toward minimizing recycling steps and reducing energy consumption in the recycling of spent LIBs.

{"title": "Development and analysis of two-dimensional point-ahead angle mechanism for space gravitational-wave detection.", "abstract": "To detect low-frequency gravitational waves, it is necessary to eliminate the interference of geo-noise and build a laser interference gravitational-wave detection device in space. Space gravitational-wave detection missions, namely Taiji, LISA, and Tianqin, have been planning to achieve picometer sensitivity on an interferometer arm of several million kilometers to meet the gravitational-wave detection requirements. Because of the orbit evolution and the time delay in interferometer arms, the direction of the transmitted laser beam changes; consequently, a remote telescope cannot receive the laser beam to complete the inter-satellite laser interference. In this study, a two-dimensional point-ahead angle mechanism (2DPAAM) is designed and demonstrated to solve the aforementioned problem. Based on the design concept of aligning the rotation center with the mirror surface center, the 2DPAAM employs a four-link flexible-hinge structure, length expanding and contracting piezoelectric stack actuators, and closed-loop control of capacitive sensors to realize two-dimensional picometer-stable, high-precision rotation. A static model is established to analyze the rotational characteristics, and finite element analysis is performed to study the mechanical properties and to verify the rotational characteristics. The yaw and pitch stiffness errors are \u223c0.93% and 5.9%, respectively, when the theoretical results are compared with the simulation results.

{"title": "A mutation in F-actin polymerization factor suppresses the distal arthrogryposis type 5 PIEZO2 pathogenic variant in Caenorhabditis elegans.", "abstract": "The mechanosensitive PIEZO channel family has been linked to over 26 disorders and diseases. Although progress has been made in understanding these channels at the structural and functional levels, the underlying mechanisms of PIEZO-associated diseases remain elusive. In this study, we engineered four PIEZO-based disease models using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We performed an unbiased chemical mutagen-based genetic suppressor screen to identify putative suppressors of a conserved gain-of-function variant pezo-1[R2405P] that in human PIEZO2 causes distal arthrogryposis type 5 (DA5; p. R2718P). Electrophysiological analyses indicate that pezo-1(R2405P) is a gain-of-function allele. Using genomic mapping and whole-genome sequencing approaches, we identified a candidate suppressor allele in the C. elegans gene gex-3. This gene is an ortholog of human NCKAP1 (NCK-associated protein 1), a subunit of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-verprolin homologous protein (WAVE/SCAR) complex, which regulates F-actin polymerization. Depletion of gex-3 by RNAi, or with the suppressor allele gex-3(av259[L353F]), significantly increased brood size and ovulation rate, as well as alleviating the crushed oocyte phenotype of the pezo-1(R2405P) mutant. Expression of GEX-3 in the soma is required to rescue the brood size defects in pezo-1(R2405P) animals. Actin organization and orientation were disrupted and distorted in the pezo-1 mutants. Mutation of gex-3(L353F) partially alleviated these defects. The identification of gex-3 as a suppressor of the pathogenic variant pezo-1(R2405P) suggests that the PIEZO coordinates with the cytoskeleton regulator to maintain the F-actin network and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of DA5 and other PIEZO-associated diseases.", "journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "date": "2024-02-13", "authors": ["XiaofeiBai", "Harold ESmith", "Luis ORomero", "BriarBell", "ValeriaV\u00e1squez", "AndyGolden"], "doi": "10.1242/dev.202214\n10.1038/ncomms2899\n10.1016/bs.ctm.2017.01.001\n10.1182/blood-2013-02-482489\n10.1093/genetics/iyab006\n10.1038/s41467-021-23482-5\n10.7554/eLife.53603\n10.1242/dev.192997\n10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313348\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1002863\n10.1038/nature09623\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602812\n10.1073/pnas.1221400110\n10.1016/j.devcel.2017.07.024\n10.7554/eLife.44706\n10.1016/j.devcel.2010.11.005\n10.1038/ncomms2673\n10.1038/s42003-019-0514-3\n10.1038/ncomms9085\n10.1038/35042517\n10.48550/arXiv.1207.3907\n10.1182/blood-2017-05-786004\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.10.002\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1003271\n10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2\n10.3390/jdb7010006\n10.1091/mbc.E20-04-0236\n10.1002/cm.21633\n10.1038/nature10801\n10.1038/ncb1476\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp352\n10.1186/s12881-018-0692-8\n10.1083/jcb.201004104\n10.1126/science.add3598\n10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.015\n10.1085/jgp.202112960\n10.1534/genetics.117.300179\n10.1038/nature20793\n10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.06.018\n10.1534/genetics.115.179382\n10.1073/pnas.1718177115\n10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.09.023\n10.1073/pnas.1409233111\n10.1038/s41467-020-16816-2\n10.1038/s41467-023-36818-0\n10.1101/gr.2505604\n10.1038/nature25453\n10.1038/nmeth.2019\n10.3324/haematol.2015.132449\n10.1007/978-1-0716-2181-3_13\n10.1002/cpbi.5\n10.1101/gr.157651.113\n10.1093/nar/gkab1061\n10.1002/ajmg.c.31411\n10.1093/nar/gkq603\n10.1038/s41586-019-1505-8\n10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110342\n10.1091/mbc.E18-06-0347\n10.1182/blood-2012-04-422253\n10.1242/dev.129635"}

Most of the previous sorting methods depend on the use of sheath flows to realize efficient cell focusing. The sheath flow dilutes the sample and requires precise flow control via additional channels. We, for the first time, reported a method of bipolar electrode (BPE)-based sheath-less focusing, switching, and tilted-angle standing surface acoustic wave-based sorting of cells and particles in continuous flow. The device consists of a piezoelectric substrate with a pair of BPEs for focusing and switching, and a pair of interdigitated transducers for cell sorting. Smaller cells experience a weak acoustic force and reach the lower outlet, whereas larger cells are subjected to a strong acoustic force such that they are propelled toward the upper outlet. We first validate the device functionality by sorting 5 and 8 \u03bcm PS beads with a high sorting efficiency. The working and deflection regions were increased by propelling the particle beam toward the bottom edge of BPE via changing the applied voltage of BPE, further improving the sorting performance with high efficiency (94%) and purity (92%). We then conducted a verification for sorting THP-1 and yeast cells, and the efficiency and purity reached 90.7 and 91.5%, respectively.

However, developing novel adsorption membranes with large adsorption capacities and enhanced adsorption performance for dyes in actual wastewater poses a significant challenge. This study focuses on the fabrication of crown ether-containing copolymer porous membrane (CRPM) and investigation of the adsorption performance of dyes from aqueous solutions. The morphology structure and pore size distribution revealed that the membrane was endowed with rich micropores and hierarchical porous structures. Three typical cationic dyes (MB, RhB, CV) and an anionic dye (MO) were selected to evaluate the adsorption behavior. The results of adsorption isotherms and kinetics demonstrated that the adsorption data could be well-fitted using the Freundlich and pseudo-first-order kinetic models, the thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption process of dyes on CRPM is a spontaneous endothermic reaction. The membrane exhibited excellent adsorption performance for cationic dyes, with RhB displaying a higher maximum adsorption capacity than previously reported porous membranes. Notably, dynamic adsorption-desorption filtration demonstrated a rapid removal efficiency, with RhB, MB, and CV achieving removal rates of 99.09%, 98.63%, and 99.14% respectively, after five cycles. The filtration volume of the CRPM membrane was 2.4-fold greater than that of a traditional PVDF membrane when applied to actual dyeing wastewater.

The mass flow control proportional valve plays a crucial role in precisely regulating the thrust. To meet the high resolution and wide range requirements of the thrusters, this paper introduces a novel proportional valve with two sets of independently controllable piezoelectric stack. One set of the piezo-stack is used to compensate the stroke loss of the valve core, mainly caused by the deformation of the valve seat. The valve sealing mechanism is carefully analyzed to reduce the stroke loss. Another set of the stack works as the primary actuator, enabling the high mass flow control resolution. Two sets of independently controlled piezoelectric stacks not only expand the range and improve the range ratio but also provide redundancy and enhance reliability. This means that the actuator can still operate at lower ranges even if one piezo-stack is damaged. The piezo-actuators are assembled using U-shaped connectors, creating a compact and space-efficient overall design.

Lung POCUS quantified B-lines in 8 quadrants. The IVCi was measured using the maximum and minimum diameters during a respiratory cycle. Both technologies were sequentially employed in a randomized fashion to acquire the parameters at 2 different time points: before the initiation of KRT (T0) and 60 minutes after the procedure had commenced (T60). We calculated the correlation and agreement between the 2 ultrasound scanner modalities.\nThe correlation between the 2 technologies for evaluating lung B-lines showed strong positive coefficients, \u2374\u00a0= 0.96 and \u2374\u00a0= 0.93 at T0 and T60, respectively (\nOur study observed a good correlation and agreement between microchip and piezoelectric-based ultrasound modalities in evaluating the presence of pulmonary B-lines and inferior vena cava (IVC) dynamics in patients with AKI. Microchip ultrasound, in addition to being portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective, consistently delivers bedside parameters for volume assessment that are comparable to those obtained through POCUS using piezoelectric transducer-based ultrasonography.", "journal": "Kidney international reports", "date": "2024-02-12", "authors": ["D\u00e9bora MiguelSoares", "Renatade Souza Mendes", "Jos\u00e9 Herm\u00f3genesRocco Suassuna"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ekir.2023.11.019\n10.1056/NEJMra0909487\n10.1186/s13054-016-1399-x\n10.1378/chest.08-1811\n10.1053/j.jvca.2018.11.002\n10.2215/CJN.00310106\n10.1007/s11255-017-1709-5\n10.1159/000014432\n10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00812.x\n10.2147/IJNRD.S165744\n10.1159/000503000\n10.1111/hdi.12871\n10.1111/hdi.12762\n10.1007/s40620-019-00666-3\n10.1053/j.jvca.2020.07.004\n10.1016/j.acvd.2020.05.005\n10.3390/jcm12062217"}

However, the crystal nucleus of ZnO featuring polar surfaces that cannot be directly attached to hydrophobic PVDF with low surface energy. Herein, direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing is employed for the first time to create \u03b2-PVDF reservoirs with significantly enhanced surface energy, facilitating the attachment and epitaxial growth of ZnO-nr. The printed \u03b2-PVDF reservoirs designed with programmed macro-pores and abundant inner micropores, enable a higher loading of ZnO-nr by more than one magnitude, thereby boosting the electro-mechanical response. The resulting PVDF/ZnO core-shell piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) delivers an output voltage of 33.2\u00a0V, as well as an unprecedentedly high relative output voltage of 2.76\u00a0V/wt.%, which is 2.63 times that of the state-of-the-art 3D-printed PVDF/piezoceramics PEHs.

For the research, we chose a piezoelectric resonator made on an AT-cut quartz plate with round electrodes, operating with a shear acoustic mode at a frequency of about 4.4 MHz. The resonator was fixed to the bottom of a 30 mL liquid container. The samples of a mixture of glycerol and water with different viscosity and conductivity were used as test liquids. First, the frequency dependences of the real and imaginary parts of the electrical impedance of a free resonator were measured and, using the Mason electromechanical circuit, the elastic module, viscosity coefficient, piezoelectric constant and dielectric constant of the resonator material (quartz) were determined. Then, the container was filled with the test sample of a liquid mixture so that the resonator was completely covered with liquid, and the measurement of the frequency dependences of the real and imaginary parts of the electrical impedance of the loaded resonator was repeated. The dependences of the frequency of parallel and series resonances, as well as the maximum values of the electrical impedance and admittance on the conductivity of liquids for various viscosity values, were plotted. It was shown that these dependences can be used to unambiguously determine the viscosity and conductivity of the test liquid.

{"title": "Enhanced Molecularly Imprinted Fluorescent Test Strip for Rapid and Visual Detection of Norfloxacin via a Smartphone.", "abstract": "Paper-based test strips with on-site visual detection have become a hot spot in the field of target detection.

Herein, a novel \"turn-on\" ratio of molecularly imprinted membranes (Eu@CDs-MIMs) was successfully prepared based on a Eu complex-doped polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for the selective, rapid and on-site visual detection of norfloxacin (NOR). The formation of surface-imprinted polymer-containing carbon dots (CDs) improves the roughness and hydrophilicity of Eu@CDs-MIMs. Fluorescence lifetimes and UV absorption spectra verified that the fluorescence enhancement of CDs is based on the synergistic effect of charge transfer and hydrogen bonding between CDs and NOR. The fluorescent test strip showed a linear fluorescent response within the concentration range of 5-50 nM with a limit of detection of 1.35 nM and a short response time of 1 min. In comparison with filter paper-based test strips, Eu@CDs-MIMs exhibit a brighter and more uniform fluorescent color change from red to blue that is visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the applied ratio fluorescent test strip was combined with a smartphone to translate RGB values into concentrations for the visual and quantitative detection of NOR and verified the detection results using high-performance liquid chromatography.

To this end, the electromechanical and vibrational characteristics of a simple configuration of a bolted Langevin transducer (BLT) and then an ultrasonic surgical device, both incorporating Mn:PIN-PMN-PT piezocrystal, are compared with the same transducer configurations incorporating a conventional hard PZT piezoceramic commonly used in high-power ultrasonic transducers. The material properties of Mn:PIN-PMN-PT are determined using a single sample characterisation technique and these are used in finite element analysis (FEA) to design and then fabricate the BLT and ultrasonic surgical device, tuned to the first and second longitudinal modes at 20\u00a0kHz respectively. FEA is similarly used for the hard PZT versions. It is found that the superior elastic compliance of Mn:PIN-PMN-PT results in a higher radial piezo-stack deformation than the hard PZT under ultrasonic excitation of the BLT.

The as-deposited film is notably deficient in alkali metal elements, particularly K, whereas the loss of alkali elements in the films can be replenished through annealing in an alkali element atmosphere. By adjusting the molar ratio of Na and K in the annealing atmosphere, the ratio of Na/K in the resultant film varied, consequently suggesting the efficiency of this method on composition regulation of KNN films. Meanwhile, we also found that the physical characteristics of the films also underwent differences with the change of an annealing atmosphere. The films annealed in a high Na atmosphere exhibit large dielectric losses with limited piezoelectric vibration behavior, while annealing in a high K atmosphere reduces the dielectric losses and enhances the piezoelectric behavior.

This technology, however, is not without its limitations. Due to increased fabrication complexity, some matrix probes with disjoint piezoelectric panels may require initial calibration. In this manuscript, two methods for calibrating the element positions of the Vermon 1024-channel 8\u2009MHz matrix transducer are detailed. This calibration is a necessary step for acquiring high resolution B-mode images while minimizing transducer-based image degradation. This calibration is also necessary for eliminating vessel-doubling artifacts in super-resolution images and increasing the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the image. Here, we show that the shape of the point spread function (PSF) can be significantly improved and PSF-doubling artifacts can be reduced by up to 10\u2009dB via this simple calibration procedure.", "journal": "Ultrasonic imaging", "date": "2024-02-09", "authors": ["Jacob RMcCall", "ArthurChavignon", "OlivierCouture", "Paul ADayton", "Gianmarco FPinton"], "doi": "10.1177/01617346241227900"}
{"title": "Cholesterol regulation of mechanosensitive ion channels.", "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of cholesterol in regulating mechanosensitive ion channels. Ion channels discussed in this review are sensitive to two types of mechanical signals, fluid shear stress and/or membrane stretch. Cholesterol regulates the channels primarily in two ways: 1) indirectly through localizing the channels into cholesterol-rich membrane domains where they interact with accessory proteins and/or 2) direct binding of cholesterol to the channel at specified putative binding sites. Cholesterol may also regulate channel function via changes of the biophysical properties of the membrane bilayer. Changes in cholesterol affect both mechanosensitivity and basal channel function. We focus on four mechanosensitive ion channels in this review Piezo, Kir2, TRPV4, and VRAC channels. Piezo channels were shown to be regulated by auxiliary proteins that enhance channel function in high cholesterol domains. The direct binding mechanism was shown in Kir2.1 and TRPV4 where cholesterol inhibits channel function. Finally, cholesterol regulation of VRAC was attributed to changes in the physical properties of lipid bilayer.

In addition, the selection of biomaterial should consider the specific clinical aspect, resorption rates, size of the particle and desired bone healing responses. It is important to emphasize that in some cases, using no bone filler might provide comparable results with reduced cost and possible complications questioning the very frequent use of ridge presentation procedures.", "journal": "Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)", "date": "2024-02-08", "authors": ["Leticia HelenaTheodoro", "Christian C\u00e9zane CardosoCampista", "Luiz Lord\u00ealoBury", "Ricardo Guanaes Barbosade Souza", "Yuri SantosMuniz", "Mari\u00e9llenLongo", "GabrielMulinari-Santos", "EdilsonErvolino", "LiranLevin", "Valdir GouveiaGarcia"], "doi": "10.3290/j.qi.b4955867"}

In this context, piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are highly regarded due to their simple design, high output performance, and cost-effectiveness. On a smaller scale, self-powered sensor research and development based on piezo-triboelectric hybrid nanogenerators have lately become more popular.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Hydrogels: Hybrid Material Design, Properties, and Biomedical Applications.", "abstract": "Hydrogels show great potential in biomedical applications due to their inherent biocompatibility, high water content, and resemblance to the extracellular matrix. However, they lack self-powering capabilities and often necessitate external stimulation to initiate cell regenerative processes. In contrast, piezoelectric materials offer self-powering potential but tend to compromise flexibility. To address this, creating a novel hybrid biomaterial of piezoelectric hydrogels (PHs), which combines the advantageous properties of both materials, offers a systematic solution to the challenges faced by these materials when employed separately. Such innovative material system is expected to broaden the horizons of biomedical applications, such as piezocatalytic medicinal and health monitoring applications, showcasing its adaptability by endowing hydrogels with piezoelectric properties. Unique functionalities, like enabling self-powered capabilities and inducing electrical stimulation that mimics endogenous bioelectricity, can be achieved while retaining hydrogel matrix advantages. Given the limited reported literature on PHs, here recent strategies concerning material design and fabrication, essential properties, and distinctive applications are systematically discussed. The review is concluded by providing perspectives on the remaining challenges and the future outlook for PHs in the biomedical field.

Bone implants with adaptability to complex morphological bone defects, bone-adhesive properties, and potent osteogenic capacity are necessary. Here, a shape-adaptive, highly bone-adhesive, and ultrasound-powered injectable nanocomposite hydrogel is developed via dynamic covalent crosslinking of amine-modified piezoelectric nanoparticles and biopolymer hydrogel networks for electrically accelerated bone healing. Depending on the inorganic-organic interaction between the amino-modified piezoelectric nanoparticles and the bio-adhesive hydrogel network, the bone adhesive strength of the prepared hydrogel exhibited an approximately 3-fold increase. In response to ultrasound radiation, the nanocomposite hydrogel could generate a controllable electrical output (-41.16 to 61.82 mV) to enhance the osteogenic effect in vitro and in vivo significantly. Rat critical-size calvarial defect repair validates accelerated bone healing. In addition, bioinformatics analysis reveals that the ultrasound-responsive nanocomposite hydrogel enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells by increasing calcium ion influx and up-regulating the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways.

{"title": "Revealing an important role of piezoelectric polymers in nervous-tissue regeneration: A review.", "abstract": "Nerve injuries pose a drastic threat to nerve mobility and sensitivity and lead to permanent dysfunction due to low regenerative capacity of mature neurons. The electrical stimuli that can be provided by electroactive materials are some of the most effective tools for the formation of soft tissues, including nerves. Electric output can provide a distinctly favorable bioelectrical microenvironment, which is especially relevant for the nervous system. Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted attention in the field of neural tissue engineering owing to their biocompatibility and ability to generate piezoelectric surface charges. In this review, an outlook of the most recent achievements in the field of piezoelectric biomaterials is described with an emphasis on piezoelectric polymers for neural tissue engineering. First, general recommendations for the design of an optimal nerve scaffold are discussed. Then, specific mechanisms determining nerve regeneration via piezoelectric stimulation are considered. Activation of piezoelectric responses via natural body movements, ultrasound, and magnetic fillers is also examined. The use of magnetoelectric materials in combination with alternating magnetic fields is thought to be the most promising due to controllable reproducible cyclic deformations and deep tissue permeation by magnetic fields without tissue heating.

Chitosan/acetic acid solution and glutaraldehyde aqueous solution were sequentially sprayed onto the surface of the PVDF solution film, with chitosan crosslinking and gelation occurring simultaneously on the film surface. The solution film was then immersed in a coagulation bath to obtain a modified PVDF porous membrane. The effect of the crosslinking time of chitosan and glutaraldehyde on the structure and properties of the PVDF porous membrane was discussed. The results showed that with the prolongation of crosslinking time, the surface structure of the membrane changed from a dense skin layer to a porous structure; the porosity and the mean pore size of the modified PVDF membranes increased first and then decreased, and the contact angle gradually decreased. When the crosslinking time extended to 15\u2009min, the water flux of modified membrane (M153) reached a maximum value. BSA dynamic cyclic filtration experiment showed that the retention rate (R) of the modified membrane was significantly improved, compared to 68.3% retention rate of the blank membrane (M000), but the crosslinking time had little effect on the retention rates of the four modified membranes. The antifouling data showed that the flux recovery rate of the blank membrane was 73.0%, while the flux recovery rate of the modified membrane can reach as high as 84.40%, and the irreversible pollution rate of the blank membrane was 27.7%, while the irreversible pollution rate of the modified membrane reduced to 15.6%. These results indicated that, after surface chitosan crosslinking, the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of PVDF membranes were improved.

In-situ inspection and monitoring methodologies are in high demand for improved quality control of printed parts. This paper presents an ultrasonic guided-wave-based method and a prototype that can potentially be used for in-situ inspection of thin-walled structures produced by DED. Lamb waves are excited by a Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric transducer bonded on the DED substrate remotely from the thin wall. The substrate works as a waveguide to transmit the waves which then propagate along the thin wall. A non-contact laser vibrometer is applied to measure the guide wave signals by scanning the surface of the thin wall. The mechanisms of guided wave generation and propagation along the substrate and printed part are theoretically studied. It allows for choosing proper inspection parameters to enhance the measurement sensitivity of guided waves and help interpret the signals for defect detection. Experiments were conducted with DED-produced stainless steel (316L) thin-walled structure. The new method is demonstrated in one example to detect and localize a small defect caused by inconsistent powder delivery of a fabricated thin wall sample, via analysing the B-scan ultrasonic guided wave signals.

{"title": "Low-Frequency Ultrasound Sensitive Piezo1 Channels Regulate Keloid-Related Characteristics of Fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Keloids are benign fibroproliferative tumors that severely diminish the quality of life due to discomfort, dysfunction, and disfigurement. Recently, ultrasound technology as a noninvasive adjuvant therapy is developed to optimize treatment protocols. However, the biophysical mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, it is proposed that piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1) plays an important role in low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS) induced mechanical transduction pathways that trigger downstream cellular signaling processes. It is demonstrated that patient-derived primary keloid fibroblasts (PKF), NIH 3T3, and HFF-1 cell migration are inhibited, and PKF apoptosis is significantly increased by LFS stimulation. And the effects of LFS is diminished by the application of GsMTx-4, the selective inhibitor of Piezo1, and the knockdown of Piezo1. More importantly, the effects of LFS can be imitated by Yoda1, an agonist of Piezo1 channels. Establishing a patient-derived xenograft keloid implantation mouse model further verified these results, as LFS significantly decreased the volume and weight of the keloids. Moreover, blocking the Piezo1 channel impaired the effectiveness of LFS treatment. These results suggest that LFS inhibits the malignant characteristics of keloids by activating the Piezo1 channel, thus providing a theoretical basis for improving the clinical treatment of keloids.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2024-02-05", "authors": ["ZixiJiang", "ZiyanChen", "YantaoXu", "HuiLi", "YixinLi", "LanyuanPeng", "HanShan", "XinLiu", "HuayiWu", "LishaWu", "DanJian", "JuanSu", "XiangChen", "ZeyuChen", "ShuangZhao"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202305489"}

There is an urgent need to develop portable, versatile, and efficient electrochemical membranes for affordable wastewater treatment. Here, a 3D conductive gradient fiber membrane (CC/PVDF) with a gradient porous structure was prepared using a two-step phase inversion method. Methyl orange (MO) was utilized as model organic substance to investigate the electrochemical performance of the CC/PVDF membrane. At applied potentials of +2\u00a0V, +3\u00a0V, -2\u00a0V and -3\u00a0V, the removal efficiency of MO was 5.1, 5.3, 4.8, and 5.1 times higher than at 0\u00a0V. A dramatic flux loss of 35.02% occurred on the membrane without electrochemistry, interestingly, whereas the flux losses were only 23.59%-10.24% in the applied potential after 30\u00a0min of filtration, which were approximately 1.18, 1.28, 1.29 and 1.38 times as high as that without electrochemistry, respectively. The enhanced removal and anti-fouling performances of the membranes were attributed to the functions of electrochemical degradation, electrostatic repulsion, and electrically enhanced wettability.

{"title": "Acoustic-driven magnetic skyrmion motion.", "abstract": "Magnetic skyrmions have great potential for developing novel spintronic devices. The electrical manipulation of skyrmions has mainly relied on current-induced spin-orbit torques. Recently, it was suggested that the skyrmions could be more efficiently manipulated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), an elastic wave that can couple with magnetic moment via the magnetoelastic effect. Here, by designing on-chip piezoelectric transducers that produce propagating SAW pulses, we experimentally demonstrate the directional motion of N\u00e9el-type skyrmions in Ta/CoFeB/MgO/Ta multilayers. We find that the shear horizontal wave effectively drives the motion of skyrmions, whereas the elastic wave with longitudinal and shear vertical displacements (Rayleigh wave) cannot produce the motion of skyrmions. A longitudinal motion along the SAW propagation direction and a transverse motion due to topological charge are simultaneously observed and further confirmed by our micromagnetic simulations. This work demonstrates that acoustic waves could be another promising approach for manipulating skyrmions, which could offer new opportunities for ultra-low power skyrmionics.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2024-02-04", "authors": ["YangYang", "LeZhao", "DiYi", "TengXu", "YahongChai", "ChenyeZhang", "DingsongJiang", "YahuiJi", "DazhiHou", "WanjunJiang", "JianshiTang", "PuYu", "HuaqiangWu", "TianxiangNan"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-024-45316-w\n10.1038/nature05056\n10.1038/nature09124\n10.1038/nnano.2013.29\n10.1038/nnano.2013.243\n10.1063/5.0046950\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab8418\n10.1063/1.5006918\n10.1063/5.0072735\n10.1126/science.aaa1442\n10.1038/nmat4593\n10.1002/adma.202104406\n10.1038/nphys3883\n10.1038/s41467-020-20528-y\n10.1002/adma.202270090\n10.1109/TED.2017.2769672\n10.1038/s41565-021-00954-9\n10.1038/nmat3862\n10.1103/PhysRevB.86.054432\n10.1038/s41565-019-0436-8\n10.1038/s41928-020-00489-2\n10.1038/s41563-018-0275-2\n10.1002/adma.201003636\n10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.07.008\n10.1063/1.5119085\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.16.044035\n10.1063/5.0042138\n10.1063/5.0047054\n10.1063/5.0062993\n10.1038/s41467-017-00456-0\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.117601\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.12.024042\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03692\n10.1088/1361-6463/ab1b04\n10.1063/5.0093654\n10.1063/1.5000080\n10.1063/9.0000159\n10.1038/s41565-020-0661-1\n10.1063/1.5013620\n10.1039/C5LC00265F\n10.1038/s41563-022-01210-8\n10.1038/nature10416\n10.1038/s41586-018-0719-5\n10.1038/s41565-022-01144-x\n10.1103/PhysRevB.103.054439\n10.1038/s41467-022-32959-w\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.30.230\n10.1088/1361-6463/acb71f\n10.1038/nature19755\n10.1038/s41592-018-0222-9\n10.1063/1.4899186\n10.1103/PhysRevB.95.144401\n10.12688/openreseurope.13302.1\n10.1088/0022-3727/49/14/145003"}

Previous studies paid attention to isolating the mechanical damping contribution and piezoelectric contribution of polymer-based piezoelectric composites (PPCs). However, reports detailing the piezoelectric damping of such materials have not paid sufficient attention to the technologies and methods to improve the piezoelectric damping of PPCs. In this study, we propose novel damping polyurethane (PU)-based piezoelectric composites with carbon-coated piezoelectric fillers (PZT@C/PU) with improved piezoelectric damping ability. The mechanical damping and piezoelectric damping of composites were theoretically decoupled, and we elaborate on the mechanism enhancing piezoelectric damping through the carbon coating strategy by comparing with the composites with nonpiezoelectric fillers.

{"title": "Generation of time-independent torque by ultrasonic guided waves.", "abstract": "The excitation of acoustic waves by a unidirectional transducer, integrated in a piezoelectric cylindrical tube or disk, can lead to a time-independent torque. This phenomenon, demonstrated earlier in experiments and analyzed with coupling-of mode theory, is explained in detail, starting on the level of lattice dynamics of a piezoelectric crystal. Expressions are derived for the stationary torque in the form of integrals over the volume or surface of the piezoelectric, involving the electric potential and displacement field associated with the acoustic waves generated by the transducer. Simulations have been carried out with the help of the finite element method for a tube made of PZT for two cases: A pre-defined potential on the surface of the tube and metal electrodes buried in the piezoelectric. The displacement field and electric potential of the high-frequency acoustic waves (between 200 and 300\u00a0kHz) were computed and used in the evaluation of the integrals. The attenuation due to various loss channels of the acoustic waves in the system has been analyzed in detail, as this plays a crucial role for the efficiency of torque generation. It is conjectured that time-reversal symmetry, present in the absence of attenuation, prohibits the generation of a static torque at least in the linear limit. A qualitative comparison is made between the simulations and earlier experiments. Discrepancies are attributed to lack of knowledge of the relevant material constants of the piezoelectric and to a simplified modeling of the electrode geometry in the cylindrical tube, which was necessary for reasons of numerical accuracy.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2024-02-03", "authors": ["I ANedospasov", "P DPupyrev", "ASotnikov", "HSchmidt", "MWeihnacht", "A PMayer"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2024.107250"}

Nonetheless, the experimental observation of EPs, particularly within the optical domain, has proven rather challenging because of the grueling demand for precise and comprehensive control over the parameter space, further compounded by the necessity for dynamic tunability. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of optical EPs when operating with an electrically tunable non-Hermitian metasurface platform that synergizes chiral metasurfaces with piezoelectric MEMS mirrors. Moreover, we show that, with a carefully constructed metasurface, a voltage-controlled spectral space can be finely tuned to access not only the chiral EP but also the diabolic point characterized by degenerate eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenstates, thereby allowing for dynamic topological phase transition.

HIV, HBV and HCV share common infection pathways; thus these 3 diseases are recommended to be tested at the same time. However, this combined approach is currently mainly available in laboratories, and seldomly at the Point-of-care (POC). Consequently, there is a need for a STI screening POC platform with laboratory-like performance. Such a platform should be autonomous and portable and enable multiplexed screening from capillary blood. The previously developed and introduced MLFIA (Magnetically Localized and wash-free Fluorescent Immuno-Assay) technology has the potential to address these needs, as the MLFIA 18-chamber microfluidic cartridge and the MLFIA Analyzer were previously characterized and evaluated with plasma and serum from patients infected with HIV, Hepatitis B (Hep B) or C (Hep C). Here, we present the efforts to transfer this research platform (MLFIA) to a fully integrated multi-analysis solution (MagIA). First, we present the design changes of the consumable enabling to perform multiple assays in parallel, a fast filling of the cartridge with patient samples, and a homogeneous reagent/sample incubation. Second, we describe the development a piezoelectric actuator integrated into the Analyzer: this mixing module allows for an automated, fully integrated and portable workflow, with homogeneous in-situ mixing capabilities. The obtained MagIA platform was further characterized and validated for immunoassays (LOD, cartridge stability over time), using various biological models including OVA and IgG. We discuss the performances of the MLFIA and MagIA platforms for the detection of HIV / Hep B / Hep C using results from 102 patient plasma samples. Lastly, we assessed the compatibility of the MagIA platform with veinous and capillary blood samples as a final step towards its POC validation.", "journal": "SLAS technology", "date": "2024-02-02", "authors": ["MFratzl", "PBigotte", "RGorbenkov", "GGoubet", "PHalfon", "PKauffmann", "DKirk", "VMasse", "XPayet-Burin", "ORamel", "SDelshadi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.slast.2024.01.001"}

{"title": "Eco-friendly hydrophobic ZIF-8/sodium alginate monolithic adsorbent: An efficient trap for microplastics in the aqueous environment.", "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs), a newly emerging class of environmental contaminants, pose a severe threat to the entire ecosystem. The development of efficient and environmentally responsible adsorbents for removing the MPs is a particularly urgent research. Herein, a kind of monolithic ZIF-8 based adsorbents featuring stable hydrophobicity and micropore-mesopore-macropore hierarchical porous structure were fabricated by in situ growth of ZIF-8 nanoparticles on sodium alginate (SA) framework, and using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a hydrophobic agent. The monolithic nature of ZIF-8/SA allowed an easy solid-liquid separation process for adsorbents from water environment compared to powdered materials. The hierarchical porous structure ensures a remarkable MPs removal performance. The ZIF-8/SA showed high adsorption capacities of 594, 585, and 282\u00a0mg/g for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), poly (vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) respectively, and rapid adsorption kinetic progress within 120\u00a0min. The ZIF-8/SA adsorbents also exhibited excellent stability in the presence of interfering ions, acid/alkali, and humic acid, and displayed adsorption performance of\u00a0>\u00a070\u00a0% even in actual aquatic environment such as tap water, river water, and seawater. The results of characterizations showed that the synergistic effect of electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic force, and van der Waals force was the main adsorption mechanism. The well-designed hydrophobic ZIF-8/SA monolithic materials would be promising to rapidly remove the MPs from the water environment.", "journal": "Journal of colloid and interface science", "date": "2024-02-02", "authors": ["YingyingLi", "SijiaZhang", "ShuangheLiu", "YuhanChen", "MinqiLuo", "JiahuiLi", "ShuangXu", "XiaohongHou"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.182"}

The scanning frequencies have a very important effect on the quality of the resulting Lissajous scanning imaging. In this paper, we propose a frequency selection rule for high definition and high frame-rate (HDHF) Lissajous scanning imaging, by deriving the relationship among the scanning field of view (FOV), actuation frequencies and pixel size based on the characteristics of the scanning trajectory. The minimum sampling rate based on the proposed frequency selection rule is further discussed. We report a lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric ceramic (PZT) based Lissajous fiber scanner to achieve HDHF Lissajous scanning imaging. Based on the frequency selection rule, different frequency combinations are calculated, under which the Lissajous fiber scanner can work at the frame rate (FR) of 10\u2005Hz, 20\u2005Hz, 40\u2005Hz and 52\u2005Hz. The trajectory evolution of the Lissajous scanning at the frame rate of 10\u2005Hz has been obtained to verify the applicability of the proposed rule. The measured resolution of the scanner is 50.8 lp/mm at the unit optical magnification, and the measured FOV at the FR of 10\u2005Hz and 40\u2005Hz are 1.620 mm \u00d71.095 mm and 0.405 mm \u00d70.27 mm, respectively.

{"title": "Highly sensitive self-focused ultrasound transducer with a bionic back-reflector for multiscale-resolution photoacoustic microscopy.", "abstract": "In this study, we designed a self-focused ultrasonic transducer made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). This transducer involves a back-reflector, which is modeled after tapetum lucidum in the eyes of some nocturnal animals. The bionic structure reflects the ultrasound, which passes through the PVDF membrane, back to PVDF and provides a second chance for the PVDF to convert the ultrasound to electric signals. This design increases the amount of ultrasound absorbed by the PVDF, thereby improving the detection sensitivity. Both ultrasonic and photoacoustic (PA) experiments were conduct to characterize the performance of the transducer. The results show that the fabricated transducer has a center frequency of 13.07\u2005MHz, and a bandwidth of 96% at -6\u2005dB. With an acoustic numerical aperture (NA) of 0.64, the transducer provides a lateral resolution of 140\u00b5m. Importantly, the bionic design improves the detection sensitivity of the transducer about 30%. Finally, we apply the fabricated transducer to optical-resolution (OR) and acoustic-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM) to achieve multiscale-resolution PA imaging.

In this report, a new method is proposed for patterning displays based on perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) on glass surfaces. A glass substrate with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) constraint layer is patterned using laser-induced plasma etching, and then a PQDs film is spin-coated on the etched sample. The PQDs pattern on the glass substrate is obtained after peeling off the PVDF constraint layer. The thickness of the film is obtained by carrying out simulations. The plasma output from different metal targets is recorded and analyzed to select the most suitable parameters and materials for improvement of the patterning accuracy. The transparent pattern display of PQDs is realized with an accuracy of 10-20 \u00b5m and a burial depth of about 1 \u00b5m. This method allows PQDs to be encapsulated under the substrate surface, which decreases the susceptibility of environmental impact. Additionally, encapsulation prevents the quantum dots from leaking out and causing environmental pollution. The proposed method has potential in the design of transparent displays and anti-counterfeiting applications.", "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2024-02-01", "authors": ["ZiyiChen", "JunChen", "TengMa", "JinningHu", "LeiHuo", "WeishuGuo", "YucongJi", "QianxiYin", "HaiboZeng", "ZhenhuaLi"], "doi": "10.1364/OE.510973"}

In this study, we developed a haptic device for force presentation using a DC motor and a tactile sensation device to simultaneously present haptic and tactile stimuli. A microelectromechanical system was selected to maintain the compactness of the tactile device. Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers are known for high-power stimulation, and we selected lanthanum-doped lead zirconate titanate as the high-power amplified actuator. A finger mount structure that transfers force for amplifying ultrasonic waves was considered to combine acoustic pressure and aeroacoustics by attaching silicone rubber.

We show here that the soil emergence-related transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) controls root penetration via transducing external signals perceived by the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The loss of FER function in Arabidopsis and soybean (Glycine max) mutants resulted in a severe defect in root penetration into agar medium or hard soil. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of Arabidopsis roots identified a distinct cell clustering pattern, especially for root cap cells, and identified PIF3 as a FER-regulated transcription factor. Biochemical, imaging, and genetic experiments confirmed that PIF3 is required for root penetration into soil. Moreover, FER interacted with and stabilized PIF3 to modulate the expression of mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO and the sloughing of outer root cap cells.", "journal": "Developmental cell", "date": "2024-02-01", "authors": ["FanXu", "JiaChen", "YingbinLi", "ShilinOuyang", "MengtingYu", "YirongWang", "XianmingFang", "KaiHe", "FengYu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.devcel.2024.01.001"}
{"title": "3D printed barium titanate/calcium silicate composite biological scaffold combined with structural and material properties.", "abstract": "In the case of a large bone defect, the human endogenous electrical field is no longer sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to support structural electrical bone scaffolds. Barium titanate (BT) has received much attention in bone tissue engineering applications due to its biocompatibility and ability to maintain charged surfaces. However, its processability is poor and it does not have the biological activity to promote mineralization, which limits its use in bone repair. In this paper, a composite bone scaffold with excellent piezoelectric properties was prepared by combining 20\u00a0wt% calcium silicate. The influence of the light curing process on the properties of the piezoelectric biological scaffold was investigated by comparing it with the traditional piezoelectric ceramic molding method (dry pressing). Despite the structural features of 3D printing (layered structure, pore features), the piezoelectric and mechanical properties of the scaffold are weakened. However, 3D-printed scaffolds can combine structural and piezoelectric properties, which makes the 3D-printed scaffold more effective in terms of degradation and antibacterial performance. In terms of cell activity, piezoelectric properties attract proteins and nutrients into the scaffold, promoting cell growth and differentiation. Besides, it is undeniable that the pore structure of the scaffolds plays an important role in the biological properties. Finally, the 3D printed scaffolds have excellent antimicrobial properties due to the redox reaction under piezoelectric effect as well as structural characterization.", "journal": "Biomaterials advances", "date": "2024-02-01", "authors": ["JunnanWu", "ChenJiao", "HanjiaoYu", "Syed Mesum RazaNaqvi", "MengxingGe", "KunzhanCai", "HuixinLiang", "JingLiu", "JianfengZhao", "ZongjunTian", "DongshengWang", "LidaShen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bioadv.2024.213783"}

However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0-3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity, and poor durability.

Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet-shaped ceramics are manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicate that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acts as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability serves as a soft component that forms a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibits excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage remains stable after 5000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5000 twisting cycles at 180\u00b0.

{"title": "Finite element modelling strategy for determining directivity of thermoelastically generated laser ultrasound.", "abstract": "Laser ultrasound (LU) is a contactless and couplant-free remote non-destructive (NDE) technique, which uses lasers for ultrasonic generation and detection rather than conventional piezoelectric transducers. For a transducer, an important characteristic is the directivity, the angle-dependent amplitude of the ultrasonic waves generated in the material. In the non-destructive thermoelastic regime, LU source has been widely modelled as a surface force dipole. However, the directivity of LU in more complex material, where there is an increasing demand for NDE, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), is yet to be understood. In the current paper, a finite element (FE) modelling methodology to obtain the directivity of LU in complex material is presented. The method is applied to a conductive isotropic material (aluminium, Al) for validation against an existing analytical solution and then applied to a heterogeneous anisotropic material (carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, CFRP). To get the directivity of a specific wave mode, the signal for that mode needs to be resolved in time from other modes at all angles. This is challenging for shear (S) waves in a small model domain due to the head wave, so a technique for suppressing the head wave is shown. The multi-physics model solves for thermal expansion, which models the laser source as a surface heat flux for the Al case, and a buried heat source for the CFRP case, according to where the energy is deposited in the material. The same ultrasound generation pattern can be obtained by using a suitable pure elastodynamic loading, which is shown to be a surface force dipole as per the validation case for Al, and a buried quadrupole for the CFRP case. The modelled directivities are scaled and fitted to experimental measurements using maximum likelihood, and the goodness of fit is discussed. For the Al case, the S wave is preferred over the longitudinal (L) wave for inspection due to greater signal amplitude. For the CFRP case, the quasi-longitudinal (qL) wave in CFRP shows a maximum amplitude directly below the source, and has a greater amplitude than the quasi-shear (qS) wave, suggesting a better choice for inspection.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2024-01-27", "authors": ["Xin LTu", "JieZhang", "Alberto MGambaruto", "Paul DWilcox"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2024.107252"}

{"title": "Computational design and evaluation of the mechanical and electrical behavior of a piezoelectric scaffold: a preclinical study.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric scaffolds have been recently developed to explore their potential to enhance the bone regeneration process using the concept of piezoelectricity, which also inherently occurs in bone. In addition to providing mechanical support during bone healing, with a suitable design, they are supposed to produce electrical signals that ought to favor the cell responses. In this study, using finite element analysis (FEA), a piezoelectric scaffold was designed with the aim of providing favorable ranges of mechanical and electrical signals when implanted in a large bone defect in a large animal model, so that it could inform future pre-clinical studies. A parametric analysis was then performed to evaluate the effect of the scaffold design parameters with regard to the piezoelectric behavior of the scaffold. The designed scaffold consisted of a porous strut-like structure with piezoelectric patches covering its free surfaces within the scaffold pores. The results showed that titanium or PCL for the scaffold and barium titanate (BT) for the piezoelectric patches are a promising material combination to generate favorable ranges of voltage, as reported in experimental studies. Furthermore, the analysis of variance showed the thickness of the piezoelectric patches to be the most influential geometrical parameter on the generation of electrical signals in the scaffold. This study shows the potential of computer tools for the optimization of scaffold designs and suggests that patches of piezoelectric material, attached to the scaffold surfaces, can deliver favorable ranges of electrical stimuli to the cells that might promote bone regeneration.", "journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "date": "2024-01-26", "authors": ["VahidBadali", "SaraCheca", "Manfred MZehn", "DraganMarinkovic", "MelikaMohammadkhah"], "doi": "10.3389/fbioe.2023.1261108\n10.1002/jbm.a.33033\n10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103517\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.876696\n10.1002/adhm.201901287\n10.1007/s10439-010-9977-6\n10.3390/proceedings1040335\n10.1002/jbmr.3801\n10.2174/1874325000802010103\n10.3390/app11178008\n10.1002/wsbm.1299\n10.1016/s1672-6529(16)60432-8\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.00609\n10.1016/j.fcl.2005.06.006\n10.3390/biom11111731\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.09.024\n10.1186/s13036-021-00255-8\n10.1002/jbm.b.31827\n10.1016/j.actbio.2010.02.002\n10.1016/j.bioactmat.2020.07.001\n10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.09.032\n10.1016/j.bone.2015.07.007\n10.1186/1742-4682-9-14\n10.1016/j.nano.2017.05.006\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000915\n10.1016/j.mtcomm.2022.103491\n10.1101/2020.03.02.974204\n10.1002/jbm.b.34253\n10.1016/j.msec.2018.12.100\n10.3389/fbioe.2022.995266\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.11.192\n10.1109/rbme.2018.2799189\n10.1039/d1ra03557f\n10.1038/s41598-018-24892-0\n10.1016/j.msec.2019.110312\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.048\n10.1063/1.5074184\n10.1021/acsami.0c10957\n10.1177/0885328220942906\n10.3390/ijms21218352\n10.1016/j.actbio.2019.10.029\n10.22190/FUME200328038M\n10.1016/j.synthmet.2014.10.035\n10.1021/acsabm.0c00765\n10.15344/2455-2372/2015/103\n10.1016/j.injury.2020.11.029\n10.1080/00150198608245016\n10.22190/fume190301031n\n10.1002/jbm.820150114\n10.1016/j.actbio.2022.04.008\n10.3389/fbioe.2020.585799\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aam8828\n10.1007/s11831-014-9120-1\n10.3390/ma13071773\n10.1016/j.msec.2021.112129\n10.3390/s19030545\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.03.015\n10.1016/j.actbio.2015.07.010\n10.1002/jbm.b.32740\n10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.11.026\n10.1016/j.matlet.2017.07.099\n10.1111/prd.12413\n10.1177/0883911519877426\n10.1016/j.actbio.2018.04.026\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2022.10.366\n10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.102\n10.1016/j.sna.2015.03.025\n10.1088/0022-3727/49/17/175403\n10.1038/s41572-021-00289-8\n10.1039/c4bm00291a\n10.3390/polym12010161\n10.1021/acsnano.6b02247\n10.1016/j.msec.2014.02.022\n10.1016/j.cej.2020.126203\n10.1016/j.injury.2011.06.199"}
{"title": "Hybrid Piezoelectric/Triboelectric Wearable Nanogenerator Based on Stretchable PVDF-PDMS Composite Films.", "abstract": "Hybrid piezoelectric/triboelectric nanogenerators combine the merits of piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), possessing enhanced electrical output and sensitivity. However, the structures of the majority of hybrid nanogenerators are rather complex in integrating both functions, limiting their practical application in wearable electronics. Herein, we propose to construct a piezoelectric/triboelectric hybrid nanogenerator (PT-NG) with a simple structure based on a composite film to simultaneously achieve the coupling of piezoelectric charge generation and triboelectrification with improved energy conversion efficiency. The composite film consists of electrospun PVDF nanofibers embedded in the surface of the PDMS film, which not only forms a rough nanomorphology on the surface of PDMS but also provides structural protection to the PVDF nanofibers by PDMS during compressive deformation. The results have shown that the PT-NG can generate much higher electrical outputs than individual TENG and PENG devices. The PT-NG devices exhibit a high level of mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency with superior performance in charging capacitors and functioning as self-powered wearable sensors for the detection of different signals from finger movement, the recognition of various gestures, and the monitoring of respiration. More importantly, the composite device possesses an impressive structure durability, maintaining its layered structure over 5000 testing cycles without noticing any obvious damage on the nanofibers or detachment between the layers. Our results have demonstrated that the combining of piezoelectric nanofibers and triboelectric substrate is an efficient way to fabricate highly efficient energy harvesting devices for intelligent identification and health monitoring.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2024-01-26", "authors": ["QianChen", "YuyingCao", "YanLu", "WasimAkram", "SongRen", "LiNiu", "ZheSun", "JianFang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.3c15760"}

PEMs can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Unlike traditional power sources, which need to be replaced and are inconvenient to carry, PEMs have extensive potential applications in smart wearable and implantable devices. However, the application of conventional PEMs is limited by their poor flexibility, low ductility, and susceptibility to fatigue failure. Incorporating hydrogels, which are flexible, stretchable, and self-healing, providing a way to overcome these limitations of PEMs. Hydrogel-based piezoelectric materials (H-PEMs) not only resolve the shortcomings of traditional PEMs but also provide biocompatibility and more promising application potential. This paper summarizes the working principle of H-PEMs. Recent advances in the use of H-PEMs as sensors and in vitro energy harvesting devices for smart wearable devices are described in detail, with emphasis on application scenarios in human body like fingers, wrists, ankles, and feet. In addition, the recent progress of H-PEMs in implantable medical devices, especially the potential applications in human body parts such as bones, skin, and heart, are also elaborated.

For patients with an uneven oocyte number, the extra oocyte was injected using conventional ICSI. The injection technique used first was also randomized to ensure that there was no bias due to order of injection.\nThe primary outcome measure was the fertilization rate after injection.\nA total of 108 patients underwent a sibling split use of conventional ICSI and PIEZO-ICSI. The fertilization rate was 71.6% in PIEZO-ICSI, which significantly increased compared with that in conventional ICSI 65.6%. In addition, the oocyte degeneration rate decreased in PIEZO-ICSI compared with that in conventional ICSI (6.3% vs. 12.1% respectively), and the blastocyst quality increased, as measured by the number of grade A and B quality blastocysts present on day 5 of development (33.3% vs. 27.5%). No significant differences in the aneuploidy or utilization rate, clinical pregnancy, or live birth outcome after single embryo transfer were noted between the two injection techniques.\nThis trial supports the possibility that PIEZO-ICSI increases the fertilization rates, decreases the oocyte degeneration rates, and increases the blastocyst quality compared with conventional ICSI; however, it does not appear to influence the clinical pregnancy or live birth rate per transfer.\nAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12620000407998.", "journal": "Fertility and sterility", "date": "2024-01-26", "authors": ["DeirdreZander-Fox", "MarkGreen", "KateWatson", "RossTurner", "Hassan WBakos", "JinnyFoo", "LeannePacella-Ince", "MelissaCaddy", "Nicole OMcPherson", "LukRombauts"], "doi": "10.1016/j.fertnstert.2024.01.028"}

However, optimizing the size and distribution of NMPs has not received sufficient emphasis because of challenges associated with the precise control of deposition and the modulation of reducing rates during growth. In this research, we achieved the optimized size and spatial patterns of AgNWs on electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers by utilizing a polydopamine (PDA) layer as a mild and controllable reduction mediator, by which the size and density of the AgNWs could be relatively precisely manipulated, achieving a dense distribution of effective \"hot spots\". On the other hand, harnessing the inherent piezoelectric properties of the electrospun PVDF nanofibers further boosted the LSPR effect during the SERS test, forming a flexible dual-enhancing composite SERS substrate with excellent sensitivity. In addition to addressing structural aspects, exploiting synergistic systems capable of transferring external energy or forces to enhance the SERS performances presents a compelling avenue to broaden the practical applications of SERS.

{"title": "Multiphysics simulation of magnetoelectric micro core-shells for wireless cellular stimulation therapy via magnetic temporal interference.", "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative approach to wireless cellular stimulation therapy through the design of a magnetoelectric (ME) microdevice. Traditional electrophysiological stimulation techniques for neural and deep brain stimulation face limitations due to their reliance on electronics, electrode arrays, or the complexity of magnetic induction. In contrast, the proposed ME microdevice offers a self-contained, controllable, battery-free, and electronics-free alternative, holding promise for targeted precise stimulation of biological cells and tissues. The designed microdevice integrates core shell ME materials with remote coils which applies magnetic temporal interference (MTI) signals, leading to the generation of a bipolar local electric stimulation current operating at low frequencies which is suitable for precise stimulation. The nonlinear property of the magnetostrictive core enables the demodulation of remotely applied high-frequency electromagnetic fields, resulting in a localized, tunable, and manipulatable electric potential on the piezoelectric shell surface. This potential, triggers electrical spikes in neural cells, facilitating stimulation. Rigorous computational simulations support this concept, highlighting a significantly high ME coupling factor generation of 550 V/m\u00b7Oe. The high ME coupling is primarily attributed to the operation of the device in its mechanical resonance modes. This achievement is the result of a carefully designed core shell structure operating at the MTI resonance frequencies, coupled with an optimal magnetic bias, and predetermined piezo shell thickness. These findings underscore the potential of the engineered ME core shell as a candidate for wireless and minimally invasive cellular stimulation therapy, characterized by high resolution and precision. These results open new avenues for injectable material structures capable of delivering effective cellular stimulation therapy, carrying implications across neuroscience medical devices, and regenerative medicine.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2024-01-25", "authors": ["Ram PrasadhNarayanan", "AliKhaleghi", "MladenVeleti\u0107", "IlangkoBalasingham"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0297114\n10.1038/s41582-020-00426-z\n10.1016/j.copbio.2022.102710\n10.3389/fnins.2022.909149\n10.1126/science.abn4732\n10.23919/EuCAP57121.2023.10133195\n10.1063/5.0115803\n10.3390/s20123487\n10.1002/adhm.202000942\n10.1038/s41467-023-39850-2\n10.1126/sciadv.1600889\n10.1038/s41591-018-0196-2\n10.1111/iwj.12204\n10.1126/sciadv.ade8622\n10.1038/s41467-021-23311-9\n10.1038/s41582-019-0145-9\n10.1016/j.jns.2020.117149\n10.1016/j.neuron.2007.06.026\n10.1111/1440-1681.12363\n10.1038/s41380-019-0499-9\n10.1007/s00221-011-2891-9\n10.3109/10601333.2015.980944\n10.1016/j.cnp.2016.12.003\n10.1002/da.23004\n10.1177/1073858418775355\n10.1038/s41593-019-0488-y\n10.1111/ner.12716\n10.1016/j.bios.2020.112888\n10.1002/wnan.1827\n10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02556\n10.1109/TBME.2018.2890530\n10.1088/1741-2552/ac2bb8\n10.1038/s41928-021-00631-8\n10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2939014\n10.1038/s41378-021-00294-7\n10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2021.100797\n10.1186/s42234-023-00122-5\n10.1021/acsnano.3c03661\n10.1088/2057-1976/ac0409\n10.1016/j.clinph.2013.11.038\n10.1016/j.brs.2020.11.007\n10.3389/fnhum.2021.693207\n10.1088/1741-2552/acb015\n10.1063/9.0000448\n10.3390/s151128889\n10.1371/journal.pone.0274676\n10.1038/s41551-022-00873-7\n10.1063/1.3359650\n10.1038/s41598-022-09171-3\n10.1016/j.sna.2020.112269\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac9166\n10.1038/s41467-021-23256-z\n10.1063/5.0171973\n10.1109/JERM.2019.2903930\n10.1145/3495243.3560541\n10.3390/mi13020272\n10.1126/sciadv.abc4189\n10.3390/s21186232\n10.1038/nmat2106\n10.2217/nnm-2017-0300\n10.1016/j.neuron.2020.05.019\n10.1038/srep20867\n10.1038/s41563-023-01680-4\n10.1063/1.4832861\n10.1063/1.4919016\n10.1063/1.331893\n10.3390/s20247142\n10.1038/s41467-022-32862-4\n10.1016/j.cels.2020.10.004\n10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764\n10.1038/s41598-021-93114-x"}

To enable reproducibility on a large scale, automation technologies for standardized handling are still a challenge. Here, a novel method for fully automated size classification and handling of cell aggregates like spheroids and organoids is presented. Using microfluidic flow generated by a piezoelectric droplet generator, aggregates are aspirated from a reservoir on one side of a thin capillary and deposited on the other side, encapsulated in free-flying nanoliter droplets to a target. The platform has aggregate aspiration and plating efficiencies of 98.1% and 98.4%, respectively, at a processing throughput of up to 21 aggregates per minute. Cytocompatibility of the method is thoroughly assessed with MCF7, LNCaP, A549 spheroids and colon organoids, revealing no adverse effects on cell aggregates as shear stress is reduced compared to manual pipetting. Further, generic size-selective handling of heterogeneous organoid samples, single-aggregate-dispensing efficiencies of up to 100% and the successful embedding of spheroids or organoids in a hydrogel with subsequent proliferation is demonstrated.

{"title": "High-Temperature Melt Stamping of Polymers Using Polymer/Nanoporous Gold Composite Stamps.", "abstract": "Parallel lithographic deposition of polymers onto counterpart substrates is a widely applied surface manufacturing operation. However, polymers may only be soluble in organic solvents or are insoluble at all. Solvent evaporation during stamping may trigger hardly controllable capillarity-driven flow processes or phase separation, and polymer solutions may spread on the counterpart substrates. Solvent-free stamping of melts prevents these drawbacks. Here, a stamp design for the deposition of melts is devised, which intrinsically circumvents ink depletion. The stamps' topographically patterned contact surfaces with protruding contact elements contacting the counterpart substrates consist of a nanoporous gold layer with a thickness of a few micrometers. The nanoporous gold layer is attached to a molten polymer layer, which is support for the nanoporous gold layer and ink reservoir at the same time. The nanoporous gold layer in turn stabilizes the topography of the stamps' contact surfaces. As examples, arrays of submicron microdots of polystyrene and poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) are manufactured.

{"title": "A lumped-parameter model of the free-flooded ring transducer array.", "abstract": "The free-flooded ring (FFR) transducer is an extensively used ring-type acoustic transducer in underwater environments owing to its broad operating frequency bandwidth and small size. However, achieving high sound pressure levels with a single FFR transducer is often difficult, thus necessitating the construction of vertically arranged FFR transducer arrays. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the electrical and acoustic characteristics of an FFR transducer array by considering the mutual radiation load and the effects of gaps between adjacent piezoelectric rings. The lumped-parameter models of the piezoelectric ring, cylindrical cavity, cylindrical gap, and radiation impedance constitute an entire impedance matrix. The radiation impedance matrix for the FFR transducer array is calculated using the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral formula by considering the interaction of the FFR surfaces with the surrounding fluid medium.

However, existing SAW sensors generally suffer from a complex design, large size, and poor robustness. In this paper, we develop a simple and stable delay line ultra-high frequency (UHF) SAW sensor for highly sensitive detection of temperature. A Z-shaped delay line is specially designed on the piezoelectric substrate to improve the sensitivity and reduce the substrate size. Herein, the optimum design parameters of extremely short-pitch interdigital transducers (IDTs) are given by numerical simulations. The extremely short pitch gives the SAW sensor ultra-high operating frequency and consequently ultra-high sensitivity. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the sensitivity of the Z-shaped SAW delay line sensor can reach up to 116.685\u00b0/\u00b0C for temperature detection.

{"title": "Low Profile Triangle-Shaped Piezoelectric Rotary Motor.", "abstract": "In this paper, we present research on a novel low-profile piezoelectric rotary motor with a triangle-shaped stator. The stator of the motor comprises three interconnected piezoelectric bimorph plates forming an equilateral triangle. Bimorph plates consist of a passive layer fabricated from stainless steel and four piezo ceramic plates glued to the upper and lower surfaces. Furthermore, spherical contacts are positioned on each bimorph plate at an offset from the plate's center. Vibrations from the stator are induced by a single sawtooth-type electric signal while the frequency of the excitation signal is close to the resonant frequency of the second out-of-plane bending mode of the bimorph plate. The offset of the spherical contacts allows for a half-elliptical motion trajectory. By contrast, the forward and backward motion velocities of the contacts differ due to the asymmetrical excitation signal. The inertial principle of the motor and the angular motion of the rotor were obtained. Numerical and experimental investigations showed that the motor operates at a frequency of 21.18 kHz and achieves a maximum angular speed of 118 RPM at a voltage of 200 V", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-01-23", "authors": ["Andrius\u010ceponis", "VytautasJ\u016br\u0117nas", "DaliusMa\u017eeika"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15010132\n10.1016/j.actaastro.2023.07.037\n10.1109/ATEE52255.2021.9425315\n10.1016/B978-0-12-813365-1.00004-7\n10.3389/frobt.2021.664655\n10.1016/j.dt.2020.02.012\n10.1016/j.precisioneng.2022.05.009\n10.1063/1.4937614\n10.1109/TTE.2019.2931123\n10.30919/esmm5f933\n10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3175853\n10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3215791\n10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.01.033\n10.1088/1361-665X/abc6b9\n10.1088/1361-665X/ac8b48\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107165\n10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106471\n10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2018.09.039\n10.3390/mi10020096\n10.1155/2020/2659475\n10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3146866\n10.1177/1045389X221121911\n10.1063/10.0019384\n10.1002/aisy.202300168\n10.1109/TUFFC.2020.2972307\n10.1016/j.compstruc.2019.03.001"}
{"title": "A 3D-Printed Piezoelectric Microdevice for Human Energy Harvesting for Wearable Biosensors.", "abstract": "The human body is a source of multiple types of energy, such as mechanical, thermal and biochemical, which can be scavenged through appropriate technological means. Mechanical vibrations originating from contraction and expansion of the radial artery represent a reliable source of displacement to be picked up and exploited by a harvester. The continuous monitoring of physiological biomarkers is an essential part of the timely and accurate diagnosis of a disease with subsequent medical treatment, and wearable biosensors are increasingly utilized for biomedical data acquisition of important biomarkers. However, they rely on batteries and their replacement introduces a discontinuity in measured signals, which could be critical for the patients and also causes discomfort. In the present work, the research into a novel 3D-printed wearable energy harvesting platform for scavenging energy from arterial pulsations via a piezoelectric material is described. An elastic thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) film, which forms an air chamber between the skin and the piezoelectric disc electrode, was introduced to provide better adsorption to the skin, prevent damage to the piezoelectric disc and electrically isolate components in the platform from the human body. Computational fluid dynamics in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1 software was employed to perform a series of coupled time-varying simulations of the interaction among a number of associated physical phenomena. The mathematical model of the harvester was investigated computationally, and quantification of the output energy and power parameters was used for comparisons. A prototype wearable platform enclosure was designed and manufactured using fused filament fabrication (FFF). The influence of the piezoelectric disc material and its diameter on the electrical output were studied and various geometrical parameters of the enclosure and the TPU film were optimized based on theoretical and empirical data. Physiological data, such as interdependency between the harvester skin fit and voltage output, were obtained.", "journal": "Micromachines", "date": "2024-01-23", "authors": ["IhorSobianin", "Sotiria DPsoma", "AntoniosTourlidakis"], "doi": "10.3390/mi15010118\n10.3390/bios13060630\n10.1016/j.medntd.2022.100118\n10.3390/bios13080775\n10.1016/j.fmre.2021.05.002\n10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100900\n10.3390/s21113806\n10.3390/en15217959\n10.1021/accountsmr.1c00002\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119379\n10.1016/j.esr.2023.101124\n10.1021/acsanm.0c01551\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105614\n10.1088/1742-6596/557/1/012026\n10.1039/C9TA00682F\n10.1126/sciadv.adh0615\n10.3390/mi12111278\n10.1007/s10854-022-09536-4\n10.3390/solids4020009\n10.3390/nanoenergyadv3040017\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.016\n10.1016/j.nanoen.2023.109024\n10.3390/s23135841\n10.3390/bios13010037\n10.1039/D1MA00131K\n10.3390/electronics9040635\n10.3390/s21206915\n10.1002/aenm.202001945\n10.1038/s41598-021-82124-4\n10.1186/1475-925X-10-33\n10.1016/j.matpr.2023.05.213\n10.1038/nmeth.2089"}
{"title": "A Review on Concrete Structural Properties and Damage Evolution Monitoring Techniques.", "abstract": "Concrete structures have emerged as some of the most extensively utilized materials in the construction industry due to their inherent plasticity and high-strength characteristics. However, due to the temperature fluctuations, humidity, and damage caused by human activities, challenges such as crack propagation and structural failures pose threats to the safety of people's lives and property. Meanwhile, conventional non-destructive testing methods are limited to defect detection and lack the capability to provide real-time monitoring and evaluating of concrete structural stability. Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on the development of effective techniques for monitoring the health of concrete structures, facilitating prompt repairs and mitigation of potential instabilities. This paper comprehensively presents traditional and novel methods for concrete structural properties and damage evolution monitoring, including emission techniques, electrical resistivity monitoring, electromagnetic radiation method, piezoelectric transducers, ultrasonic techniques, and the infrared thermography approach. Moreover, the fundamental principles, advantages, limitations, similarities and differences of each monitoring technique are extensively discussed, along with future research directions.

ADM aims to automatically, continuously, and objectively measure dimensions of food intake in a free-living environment. This could simplify the food registration process, thereby overcoming frequent memory, underestimation, and overestimation problems. In this study, an eating event detection sensor system was developed comprising a smartwatch worn on the wrist containing an accelerometer and gyroscope for eating gesture detection, a piezoelectric sensor worn on the jaw for chewing detection, and a respiratory inductance plethysmographic sensor consisting of two belts worn around the chest and abdomen for food swallowing detection. These sensors were combined to determine to what extent a combination of sensors focusing on different steps of the dietary cycle can improve eating event classification results. Six subjects participated in an experiment in a controlled setting consisting of both eating and non-eating events. Features were computed for each sensing measure to train a support vector machine model.

In this study, a number of machine learning algorithms were evaluated to classify US transducer misalignment, based on data signal transmissions between the transmitter and receiver. Over seven hundred US signals were acquired across a range of transducer misalignments. Signal envelopes and spectrograms were used to train and evaluate machine learning (ML) algorithms, classifying misalignment extent. The algorithms included an autoencoder, convolutional neural network (CNN) and neural network (NN). The best performing algorithm, was deployed onto a TinyML device for evaluation. Such systems exploit low power microcontrollers developed specifically around edge device applications, where algorithms were configured to run on low power, restricted memory systems. TensorFlow Lite and Edge Impulse, were used to deploy trained models onto the edge device, to classify signals according to transducer misalignment extent. TinyML deployment, demonstrated near real-time (<350 ms) signal classification achieving accuracies > 99%.

Three surface-bonded PWASs were examined, including one intentionally bonded with a reduced adhesive to create a defective bond. Thermal cyclic aging was applied, monitoring through laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) and static capacitance measurements. The PWAS with the initially defective bond exhibited the poorest performance over aging cycles, emphasizing the significance of the initial bond condition. As debonding progressed, modifications in electromechanical behavior were observed, leading to a reduction in wave amplitude and distortion of the generated wave field, challenging the validity of existing analytical modeling of wave-tuning curves for perfectly bonded PWASs.

{"title": "A Wide-Band Magnetoelectric Sensor Based on a Negative-Feedback Compensated Readout Circuit.", "abstract": "Magnetoelectric (ME) sensors cannot effectively detect broadband magnetic field signals due to their narrow bandwidth, and existing readout circuits are unable to vary the bandwidth of the sensors. To expand the bandwidth, this paper introduces a negative-feedback readout circuit, fabricated by introducing a negative-feedback compensation circuit based on the direct readout circuit of the ME sensor. The negative-feedback compensation circuit contains a current amplifier, a feedback resistor, and a feedback coil. For this purpose, a Metglas/PVDF/Metglas ME sensor was prepared. Experimental measurements show that there is a six-fold difference between the maximum and minimum values of the ME voltage coefficients in the 6-39 kHz frequency band for the ME sensor without the negative-feedback compensation circuit when the sensor operates at the optimal bias magnetic field. However, the ME voltage coefficient in this band remains stable, at 900 V/T, after the charge amplification of the direct-reading circuit and the negative-feedback circuit. In addition, experimental results show that this negative-feedback readout circuit does not increase the equivalent magnetic noise of the sensor, with a noise level of 240 pT/\u221aHz in the frequency band lower than 25 kHz, 63 pT/\u221aHz around the resonance frequency of 30 kHz, and 620 pT/\u221aHz at 39 kHz.

An experimental sample of the transducer is fabricated and assembled, and its electrical impedance curve is measured.

Clinical and tomographic evaluations were performed before the surgical procedure and at 24-month follow-up. This case was treated using a C-ADN system fitted to a piezotome for the buccal approach of the buccal roots, maxillary sinus membrane lifting, and for transantral location, root-end resection, cavity preparation, and filling of the palatal root. The navigation system allowed to achieve an accurate apical canal terminus location and root-end filling of the three roots with a minimally invasive piezoelectric crypt approach. At the 24-month follow-up examination, the patient remains asymptomatic, with normal periapical structures, and regeneration of maxillary sinus walls.

{"title": "Flow-Induced Shear Stress Primes NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Macrophages via Piezo1.", "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a crucial component of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in initiating and regulating the body's inflammatory response to various pathogens and cellular damage. Environmental stimuli, such as temperature, pH level, and nutrient availability, can influence the behavior and functions of innate immune cells, including immune cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. However, there is limited understanding regarding how mechanical forces, like shear stress, govern the intrinsic inflammatory reaction, particularly the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and how shear stress impacts NLRP3 inflammasome activation through its capacity to induce alterations in gene expression and cytokine secretion. Here, we investigated how shear stress can act as a priming signal in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by exposing immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) to numerous physiologically relevant magnitudes of shear stress before chemically inducing inflammasome activation. We demonstrated that shear stress of large magnitudes was able to prime iBMDMs more effectively for inflammasome activation compared to lower shear stress magnitudes, as quantified by the percentage of cells where ASC-CFP specks formed and IL-1\u03b2 secretion, the hallmarks of inflammasome activation. Testing this in NLRP3 and caspase-1 knockout iBMDMs showed that the NLRP3 inflammasome was primarily primed for activation due to shear stress exposure. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and a small-molecule inhibitor study mechanistically determined that shear stress regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome by upregulating Piezo1, IKK\u03b2, and NLRP3. These findings offer insights into the mechanistic relationship among physiological shear stresses, inflammasome activation, and their impact on the progression of inflammatory diseases and their interconnected pathogenesis.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2024-01-19", "authors": ["AdamFish", "AshishKulkarni"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.3c18645"}

We introduce a novel method for controlling the density of such ZnO nanowire arrays using a three-dimensional corrugated metal substrate. These metal substrates, featuring extruded and recessed patterns fabricated via nanoimprint lithography, were employed as cathodes during the electrochemical deposition of ZnO nanowire arrays. The ZnO nanowire arrays synthesized on the patterned metal thin film exhibited smaller diameters and lower densities compared to those on non-patterned metal films. This reduction in density can be attributed to aligned nucleation and limited growth on the patterned metal surface. Crucially, ZnO nanowires synthesized on patterned metal substrates displayed remarkable mechanical robustness against external forces, a direct consequence of their reduced density. In contrast, nanowires synthesized on non-patterned metal substrates were broken under mechanical bending. Detailed morphological analyses performed after mechanical bending tests confirm that ZnO nanowires synthesized on nanoimprinted metal electrodes exhibited enhanced mechanical characteristics compared to those on non-patterned metal electrodes.

The series capacitance is added to adjust the quality factor of the resonance tank so that a desired wave filtering effect can be obtained. The values of the series inductance and capacitance are derived based on the Butterworth-Van Dyke model of the piezoelectric ultrasonic motor. Simulations are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed matching method. Finally, the waveforms of voltages and currents as well as torque-speed curves of the motor are measured. The results validate the proposed matching method. In addition, the previous series inductance matching method is compared.

{"title": "Piezo1-Mediated Neurogenic Inflammatory Cascade Exacerbates Ventricular Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction.", "abstract": "Heart failure is associated with a high rate of mortality and morbidity, and ventricular remodeling invariably precedes heart failure. Ventricular remodeling is fundamentally driven by mechanotransduction that is regulated by both the nervous system and the immune system. However, it remains unknown which key molecular factors govern the neuro/immune/cardio axis that underlies mechanotransduction during ventricular remodeling. Here, we investigated whether the mechanosensitive Piezo cation channel-mediated neurogenic inflammatory cascade underlies ventricular remodeling-related mechanotransduction.\nBy ligating the left coronary artery of rats to establish an in vivo model of chronic myocardial infarction (MI), lentivirus-mediated thoracic dorsal root ganglion (TDRG)-specific Piezo1 knockdown rats and adeno-associated virus-PHP.S-mediated TDRG neuron-specific Piezo1 knockout mice were used to investigate whether Piezo1 in the TDRG plays a functional role during ventricular remodeling Subsequently, neutralizing antibody-mediated TDRG IL-6 (interleukin-6) inhibition rats and adeno-associated virus-PHP.S-mediated TDRG neuron-specific IL-6 knockdown mice were used to determine the mechanism underlying neurogenic inflammation. Primary TDRG neurons were used to evaluate Piezo1 function in vitro.\nExpression of Piezo1 and IL-6 was increased, and these factors were functionally activated in TDRG neurons at 4 weeks after MI. Both knockdown of TDRG-specific Piezo1 and deletion of TDRG neuron-specific Piezo1 lessened the severity of ventricular remodeling at 4 weeks after MI and decreased the level of IL-6 in the TDRG or heart. Furthermore, inhibition of TDRG IL-6 or knockdown of TDRG neuron-specific IL-6 also ameliorated ventricular remodeling and suppressed the IL-6 cascade in the heart, whereas the Piezo1 level in the TDRG was not affected. In addition, enhanced Piezo1 function, as reflected by abundant calcium influx induced by Yoda1 (a selective agonist of Piezo1), led to increased release of IL-6 from TDRG neurons in mice 4 weeks after MI.\nOur findings point to a critical role for Piezo1 in ventricular remodeling at 4 weeks after MI and reveal a neurogenic inflammatory cascade as a previously unknown facet of the neuronal immune signaling axis underlying mechanotransduction.", "journal": "Circulation", "date": "2024-01-18", "authors": ["MeiyanSun", "SuiMao", "ChaoWu", "XiaoyongZhao", "ChengxiaoGuo", "JunHu", "ShijinXu", "FenZheng", "GuoqingZhu", "HuiTao", "ShufangHe", "JiHu", "YeZhang"], "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065390"}

However, generating perceptually sufficient displacement in the low-frequency domain is challenging. This study presents a lever mechanism mounted on a diaphragm vibrator to enhance the vibrotactile intensity of low-frequency vibrotactile stimuli. The lever mechanism is inspired by the tactile contact lens consisting of an array of cylinders held against the skin on a sheet that enhances micro-bump tactile detection. We built an experimental apparatus including our previously developed thin-film diaphragm-type vibrator, which reproduced the common characteristic of piezoelectric vibrators: near-threshold displacement (10 to 20 \u03bcm) at low frequency. Experiments demonstrated enhanced vibrotactile intensity at frequencies less than 100 Hz with the lever mechanism.

{"title": "Wireless facial biosensing system for monitoring facial palsy with flexible microneedle electrode arrays.", "abstract": "Facial palsy (FP) profoundly influences interpersonal communication and emotional expression, necessitating precise diagnostic and monitoring tools for optimal care. However, current electromyography (EMG) systems are limited by their bulky nature, complex setups, and dependence on skilled technicians. Here we report an innovative biosensing approach that utilizes a PEDOT:PSS-modified flexible microneedle electrode array (P-FMNEA) to overcome the limitations of existing EMG devices. Supple system-level mechanics ensure excellent conformality to the facial curvilinear regions, enabling the detection of targeted muscular ensemble movements for facial paralysis assessment. Moreover, our apparatus adeptly captures each electrical impulse in response to real-time direct nerve stimulation during neurosurgical procedures. The wireless conveyance of EMG signals to medical facilities via a server augments access to patient follow-up evaluation data, fostering prompt treatment suggestions and enabling the access of multiple facial EMG datasets during typical 6-month follow-ups. Furthermore, the device's soft mechanics alleviate issues of spatial intricacy, diminish pain, and minimize soft tissue hematomas associated with traditional needle electrode positioning.

Our home-built STM head is compact (51.5\u00a0mm long and 20\u00a0mm in diameter) and has a single arm that provides complete openness in the scanning area between the tip and sample. The STM head consists of two piezoelectric tubes (PTs), a piezoelectric scanning tube (PST) mounted on a well-polished zirconia shaft, and a large PT housed in a sapphire tube called the motor tube. The main body of the STM head is made of tantalum. In this design, we fixed the sapphire tube to the frame with screws so that the tube's position can be changed quickly. To analyse the stiffness of the STM head unit, we identified the lowest eigenfrequencies with 3 and 4\u00a0kHz in the bending modes, 8\u00a0kHz in a torsional mode, and 9\u00a0kHz in a longitudinal mode by finite element analysis, and also measured the low drift rates in the X-Y plane and in the Z direction. The high performance of the home-built STM was demonstrated by images of the hexagonal graphite lattice at 300 K and in a sweeping magnetic field from 0 T to 9 T.

{"title": "Effect of Polyvinylpyrrolidone on the Structure Development, Electrical, Thermal, and Wetting Properties of Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Expanded Graphite Nanocomposites.", "abstract": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-expanded graphite (ExGr) nanocomposites have been prepared by solution blending and melt processing methods. In the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), enhanced dispersion of graphite nanosheets (GNSs) in the PVDF matrix, as suggested by field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis, results in very low electrical percolation threshold (0.3 wt % ExGr). X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses confirm the coexistence of electroactive gamma and nonpolar alpha phases. Wrapping of PVP chains around GNSs reduces the crystallinity in PVDF-ExGr nanocomposites in comparison to that in neat PVDF films, as evidenced by DSC analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms enhanced thermal stability of PVDF-ExGr nanocomposites above 500 \u00b0C mainly attributed to the PVP-assisted dispersion of GNSs. The water contact angle of solution-blended PVDF-ExGr nanocomposite films increases with and without PVP in comparison to that of the neat PVDF film.

{"title": "Mechanosensitive receptors in migraine: a systematic review.", "abstract": "Migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder with pain profile, suggesting exaggerated mechanosensation. Mechanosensitive receptors of different families, which specifically respond to various mechanical stimuli, have gathered increasing attention due to their potential role in migraine related nociception. Understanding these mechanisms is of principal importance for improved therapeutic strategies. This systematic review comprehensively examines the involvement of mechanosensitive mechanisms in migraine pain pathways.\nA systematic search across the Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline was conducted on 8th August 2023 for the period from 2000 to 2023, according to PRISMA guidelines. The review was constructed following a meticulous evaluation by two authors who independently applied rigorous inclusion criteria and quality assessments to the selected studies, upon which all authors collectively wrote the review.\nWe identified 36 relevant studies with our analysis. Additionally, 3 more studies were selected by literature search. The 39 papers included in this systematic review cover the role of the putative mechanosensitive Piezo and K2P, as well as ASICs, NMDA, and TRP family of channels in the migraine pain cascade. The outcome of the available knowledge, including mainly preclinical animal models of migraine and few clinical studies, underscores the intricate relationship between mechanosensitive receptors and migraine pain symptoms. The review presents the mechanisms of activation of mechanosensitive receptors that may be involved in the generation of nociceptive signals and migraine associated clinical symptoms. The gender differences of targeting these receptors as potential therapeutic interventions are also acknowledged as well as the challenges related to respective drug development.\nOverall, this analysis identified key molecular players and uncovered significant gaps in our understanding of mechanotransduction in migraine. This review offers a foundation for filling these gaps and suggests novel therapeutic options for migraine treatments based on achievements in the emerging field of mechano-neurobiology.", "journal": "The journal of headache and pain", "date": "2024-01-15", "authors": ["AdrianaDella Pietra", "LauraG\u00f3mez Dab\u00f3", "PetrMikulenka", "ChristianEspinoza-Vinces", "DogaVuralli", "IsilBaytekin", "PaoloMartelletti", "RashidGiniatullin", "NoneNone"], "doi": "10.1186/s10194-023-01710-1\n10.1007/s00221-009-1756-y\n10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70090-0\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0511-10.2010\n10.1002/ana.25926\n10.1146/annurev-neuro-080422-105509\n10.1177/17448069231181358\n10.1124/pr.113.008029\n10.1038/s41582-018-0003-1\n10.1046/j.1468-2982.1997.1703166.x\n10.1186/s12974-020-02029-3\n10.1111/bph.15710\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.12.024\n10.1016/0304-3959(88)90012-7\n10.1186/s10194-021-01353-0\n10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01983.x\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3390-16.2017\n10.1177/0333102418774299\n10.1017/S1462399411002067\n10.1038/384560a0\n10.1126/science.1231897\n10.1152/jn.1998.79.2.964\n10.1124/jpet.107.123745\n10.1002/1531-8249(200005)47:5<614::AID-ANA9>3.0.CO;2-N\n10.1186/s10194-019-1043-7\n10.1016/j.cophys.2023.100706\n10.1111/head.12948\n10.1038/35093019\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601116\n10.3390/ijms241814113\n10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113594\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.056\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097\n10.1107/S2052252521013488\n10.1124/jpet.106.116657\n10.1038/39807\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.1967.tb01984.x\n10.1007/s00281-015-0528-y\n10.1186/s10194-015-0539-z\n10.1038/nature719\n10.1186/1129-2377-14-71\n10.1136/jnnp-2014-308813\n10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.04.064\n10.1113/jphysiol.2006.121111\n10.1177/0333102418779548\n10.1111/bph.14994\n10.1016/j.ceca.2011.09.005\n10.1186/s10194-021-01383-8\n10.1111/bju.13225\n10.1016/0304-3940(96)12838-X\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1943-12.2013\n10.1177/0333102415584313\n10.1152/jn.00029.2002\n10.1016/j.neulet.2015.09.033\n10.1111/bph.13821\n10.1016/j.neulet.2022.136494\n10.1016/j.neuropharm.2019.02.015\n10.1016/j.expneurol.2021.113634\n10.3390/ijms23031370\n10.1111/head.12152\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0350-22.2022\n10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.049\n10.1038/nature10812\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.075\n10.3390/ijms22169062\n10.1186/s10194-023-01643-9\n10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00198-2"}

{"title": "Technological Advances and Market Developments of Solid-State Batteries: A Review.", "abstract": "Batteries are essential in modern society as they can power a wide range of devices, from small household appliances to large-scale energy storage systems. Safety concerns with traditional lithium-ion batteries prompted the emergence of new battery technologies, among them solid-state batteries (SSBs), offering enhanced safety, energy density, and lifespan. This paper reviews current state-of-the-art SSB electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as global SSB market trends and key industry players. Solid-state electrolytes used in SSBs include inorganic solid electrolytes, organic solid polymer electrolytes, and solid composite electrolytes. Inorganic options like lithium aluminum titanium phosphate excel in ionic conductivity and thermal stability but exhibit mechanical fragility. Organic alternatives such as polyethylene oxide and polyvinylidene fluoride offer flexibility but possess lower ionic conductivity. Solid composite electrolytes combine the advantages of inorganic and organic materials, enhancing mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. While significant advances have been made for composite electrolytes, challenges remain for synthesis intricacies and material stability. Nuanced selection of these electrolytes is crucial for advancing resilient and high-performance SSBs. Furthermore, while global SSB production capacity is currently below 2 GWh, it is projected to grow with a >118% compound annual growth rate by 2035, when the potential SSB market size will likely exceed 42 billion euros.", "journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2024-01-11", "authors": ["FelixThomas", "LaurenMahdi", "JulienLemaire", "Diogo M FSantos"], "doi": "10.3390/ma17010239\n10.1016/0025-5408(80)90012-4\n10.1016/j.mattod.2014.10.040\n10.1038/nclimate2564\n10.1002/ese3.95\n10.1016/j.susmat.2021.e00297\n10.1039/D0CS00305K\n10.1016/j.pmatsci.2022.100921\n10.1038/s41563-019-0431-3\n10.3390/electrochem2030026\n10.1039/C9EE04039K\n10.1038/srep13271\n10.1039/D3SC02093B\n10.1016/j.jechem.2023.05.011\n10.1016/j.memsci.2023.121552\n10.1021/acsenergylett.2c01981\n10.1002/adfm.202211211\n10.1039/D1TA10966A\n10.1515/eng-2022-0043\n10.1002/aenm.202101437\n10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03318.x\n10.1039/C9TA04999A\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.055\n10.1016/j.ssi.2011.10.022\n10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100750\n10.1016/j.joule.2020.03.012\n10.1039/C9EE01548E\n10.1007/s41918-019-00048-0\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161013\n10.3390/ma16062510\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232907\n10.1016/0038-1098(93)90841-A\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.12.361\n10.1007/s10854-021-05699-8\n10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00884-0\n10.1016/S0167-2738(01)00821-9\n10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.007\n10.1016/0025-5408(76)90077-5\n10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01222\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229919\n10.1002/aenm.201800933\n10.1016/j.ensm.2018.02.020\n10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03000\n10.1038/nmat3066\n10.1038/nmat4369\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.10.037\n10.1002/adma.201901131\n10.1002/anie.200703900\n10.1039/C9TA04555D\n10.1002/chem.201703116\n10.1016/j.mattod.2021.03.013\n10.3389/fenrg.2016.00038\n10.1021/acsami.0c11683\n10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00077-2\n10.1016/j.nxener.2023.100042\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.096\n10.1002/adma.201606042\n10.1039/C8TA02276C\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.086\n10.1002/batt.202300306\n10.1038/nenergy.2016.30\n10.1038/s41467-018-06123-2\n10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b01937\n10.1016/j.matlet.2020.127508\n10.1016/j.elecom.2021.107058\n10.1002/adma.201803075\n10.1007/s41918-023-00179-5\n10.1007/s40820-023-01051-3\n10.1002/adma.202000223\n10.1088/0022-3727/41/22/223001\n10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.007\n10.1016/j.ensm.2020.08.014\n10.1016/j.mser.2018.10.004\n10.1007/s40145-021-0489-7\n10.1186/s40580-020-00252-5\n10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118697\n10.3389/fchem.2019.00522\n10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107863\n10.1016/j.ensm.2021.11.021\n10.1016/j.ensm.2020.10.006\n10.1016/j.ensm.2021.02.034\n10.1021/acsami.0c06922\n10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117538\n10.1002/adfm.201805301\n10.1016/j.electacta.2018.10.005\n10.1007/s10008-020-04858-x\n10.1126/science.aay8672\n10.1002/aenm.202000904\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.232914\n10.1016/j.ssi.2022.116044\n10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.168774\n10.1016/j.ensm.2022.11.054\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233386\n10.1016/j.est.2023.108715\n10.1016/S1872-5805(22)60630-9\n10.1016/j.cossms.2023.101079\n10.1016/j.cej.2023.141993\n10.1016/j.joule.2022.05.016\n10.1016/j.joule.2023.02.001\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2023.233518\n10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142360\n10.1016/j.cej.2023.142386\n10.1016/j.cej.2023.144381\n10.1021/acsaem.8b01141\n10.1149/2.0491813jes\n10.1016/j.jechem.2019.02.006\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227230\n10.1016/j.jcis.2023.06.052\n10.1002/batt.202200223\n10.1016/j.mattod.2022.07.016\n10.1016/j.electacta.2005.07.050\n10.1016/j.matdes.2017.01.088\n10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.164\n10.1002/adma.201800615\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02457\n10.24406/PUBLICA-FHG-298775\n10.12968/S0047-9624(23)60182-8\n10.24406/PUBLICA-FHG-300062\n10.1109/ICRERA.2018.8566719\n10.1557/s43581-021-00004-w\n10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.138"}

The membrane morphology and physical properties were studied via small-(SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), SEM, and DSC. It was found that the crystallinity degree is 17% for PEM-RCF (co-polymer with SPA) and 16% for PEM-RCF-2 (copolymer with SPA and PFH).

{"title": "Flexible Film Bulk Acoustic Wave Filter Based on Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluorethylene).", "abstract": "Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluorethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) has promising potential applications in radio-frequency filters due to their excellent piezoelectric properties, flexibility, and stability. In this paper, a flexible film bulk acoustic wave filter is investigated based on P(VDF-TrFE) as piezoelectric film. A new method based on three-step annealing is developed to efficiently remove the porosity inside the P(VDF-TrFE) films so as to improve its properties. The obtained film achieved high \u03b2-phase content beyond 80% and a high piezoelectric coefficient of 27.75 pm/V. Based on the low porosity \u03b2-phase films, a flexible wide-band RF filter is designed, which consists of a bulk acoustic wave resonator and lumped inductor-capacitor elements as a hybrid configuration. The resonator sets the filter's center frequency, while the lumped LC-based matching network extends the bandwidth and enhances out-of-band rejection. The testing results of the proposed wide-band filter show its good performance, with 12.5% fractional bandwidth and an insertion loss of 3.1 dB. To verify the possibility of folding and stacking the flexible bulk acoustic wave devices for high-density multi-filter integration in MIMO communication, bending tests of the filter are also conducted with the bending strain range up to 5500 \u03bc\u03b5. The testing results show no noticeable performance degradation after four bending cycles.

An experimental setup wherein the ionic reactant is prepared and allowed to react with neutral reactants within a confined interaction space is most desirable for this approach. Here, we present our efforts in constructing a 22-pole radio-frequency ion trap experimental setup that could act as a reaction chamber for the neutral reactant and trapped ions. A compact piezo-based pulsed supersonic expansion discharge source was developed to achieve efficient production of anions, particularly metal-bearing ions. In addition, two other ion sources, namely, the electron impact ion source and the plasma supersonic discharge ion source, were developed to cater to the production of specific ions. The geometry of this experimental setup facilitates photo excitation of trapped ions. The trapping efficiency was studied by trapping SF5+ and SF6- for a few seconds. The control exhibited by various parameters on the efficiency of the trapping is discussed in detail.

However, traditional power sources integrated into these IBDs possess intricate limitations such as bulkiness, rigidity, and biotoxicity. Recently, artificial \"tissue batteries\" (ATBs) have diffusely developed as artificial power sources for IBDs manufacturing, enabling comprehensive biological-activity monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy. ATBs are on-demand and designed to accommodate the soft and confining curved placement space of organisms, minimizing interface discrepancies, and providing ample power for clinical applications. This review presents the near-term advancements in ATBs, with a focus on their miniaturization, flexibility, biodegradability, and power density. Furthermore, it delves into material-screening, structural-design, and energy density across three distinct categories of TBs, distinguished by power supply strategies. These types encompass innovative energy storage devices (chemical batteries and supercapacitors), power conversion devices that harness power from human-body (biofuel cells, thermoelectric nanogenerators, bio-potential devices, piezoelectric harvesters, and triboelectric devices), and energy transfer devices that receive and utilize external energy (radiofrequency-ultrasound energy harvesters, ultrasound-induced energy harvesters, and photovoltaic devices).

A seven-fold improvement in signal to noise ratio has been demonstrated compared to NICE-OHMS alone and a limit of detection of 6.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910", "journal": "Optics letters", "date": "2024-01-09", "authors": ["XiaobinZhou", "GangZhao", "YongLi", "ZiweiCheng", "KangJiao", "BofengZhang", "ZihaoZhang", "YankeLi", "XiaojuanYan", "WeiguangMa", "SuotangJia"], "doi": "10.1364/OL.507004"}
{"title": "Immunoblot Analysis from Single Cells Using Milo\u2122 Single-Cell Western Platform.", "abstract": "In this new era of precision medicine, characterization of single-cell subpopulations to better understand disease etiology is paramount. It is thus an opportune time to explore techniques that allow molecular analysis of single cells and to better understand the basis of pathogenesis of diseases like cancer. Single-cell western blotting is one such method that allows analysis of single cells at the protein level. In contrast to traditional western blotting, which relies heavily on bulk analysis of lysates generated from tissues and is often indicative of the population average, this technique allows analysis of lysates from single-cell subpopulations thereby providing a glimpse into cell heterogeneity. The method entails the use of a chip containing 30\u00a0\u03bcm thick photoactivated polyacrylamide gel spotted with nearly 6400 microwells. Single cells loaded on the chip are captured in the microwells by passive gravity and are then lysed and electrophoresed using the MILO\u2122 single-cell western platform. This method forgoes the use of transfer of proteins on a PVDF and a nitrocellulose membrane, as performed in traditional western blotting, and all other steps including probing of primary and fluorescent secondary antibodies against the protein of interest are performed directly on the chip. The proteins of interest can then be visualized by scanning a chip with the use of a microarray scanner. The entire procedure can be performed in as less as 4-6\u00a0h, and thus this method provides several advantages over traditional western blotting.", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "date": "2024-01-09", "authors": ["Prashant VThakkar"], "doi": "10.1007/978-1-0716-3621-3_13\n10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60452-7\n10.1073/pnas.0910672106\n10.1038/nature08250\n10.1038/nrg.2016.86\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.01.018\n10.1093/annonc/mdu480\n10.1186/s13059-017-1218-y\n10.18632/oncotarget.17893\n10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4\n10.1038/nmeth.2992"}

However, a robust installation of PZT patches is challenging due to the often-complex geometry and non-accessibility of structural parts.

To alleviate the above-mentioned challenges, the non-bonded and reusable configuration of sensor received considerable interest in the field of SHM. However, ensuring the repeatability and reproducibility of Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) measurements is crucial to establish the reliability of these techniques. This work investigated the repeatability and reproducibility measures for one of non-bonded configuration of PZT patch i.e., Metal Foil Based Piezo Sensor (MFBPS). In addition, the concept, application, and suitability of MFBPS for impedance-based monitoring technique of Civil infrastructure are critically discussed. This study evaluates the effect of length of MFBPS on piezo coupled admittance signature. Also, this study evaluates repeatability and reproducibility of EMI measurements via statistical tools such as ANOVA and Gage R&R analysis. The statistical index CCDM was used to quantify the deviations of impedance signals. The overall result shows that the repeatability of the EMI measurements improves with a metal foil length of 500\u00a0mm.

{"title": "Defining ferroelectric characteristics with reversible piezoresponse: PUND switching spectroscopy PFM characterization.", "abstract": "Detecting ferroelectricity at micro- and nanoscales is crucial for advanced nanomaterials and materials with complicated topography. Switching spectroscopy piezoresponse force microscopy (SSPFM), which involves measuring piezoelectric hysteresis loops via a scanning probe microscopy tip, is a widely accepted approach to characterize polarization reversal at the local scale and confirm ferroelectricity. However, the local hysteresis loops acquired through this method often exhibit unpredictable shapes, a phenomenon often attributed to the influence of parasitic factors such as electrostatic forces and current flow. Our research has uncovered that the deviation in hysteresis loop shapes can be caused by spontaneous backswitching occurring after polarization reversal. Moreover, we've determined that the extent of this effect can be exacerbated when employing inappropriate SSPFM waveform parameters, including duration, frequency, and AC voltage amplitude. Notably, the conventional 'pulse-mode' SSPFM method has been found to intensify spontaneous backswitching. In response to these challenges, we have redesigned SSPFM approach by introducing the positive up-negative down (PUND) method within the 'step-mode' SSPFM. This modification allows for effective probing of local piezoelectric hysteresis loops in ferroelectrics with reversible piezoresponse while removing undesirable electrostatic contribution. This advancement extends the applicability of the technique to a diverse range of ferroelectrics, including semiconductor ferroelectrics and relaxors, promising a more reliable and accurate characterization of their properties.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2024-01-05", "authors": ["DenisAlikin", "ViolettaSafina", "AlexanderAbramov", "BorisSlautin", "VladimirShur", "AnatolyPavlenko", "AndreiKholkin"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ad1b97"}

In this paper, the tunable underwater sound absorption of a 0-3 PCM combined with a cavity structure and shunt circuit (PCMC) is studied systematically. First, the equivalent material parameters of 0-3 PCM are derived based on the Yamada model, and then a theoretical electroacoustic model is established for solving the absorption coefficient and is mutually verified with the numerical simulation method. On this basis, the tunable absorption characteristics of the structure are analyzed. The results show that coupling the energy dissipation mechanism of 0-3 PCM with the acoustic mechanism of the cavity structure not only achieves strong absorption at lower frequencies but also enriches the absorption mode in the mid-high frequencies by connecting the shunt circuits. Moreover, the influence of piezoelectric control variables and acoustic cavity morphology characteristics on structural sound absorption performance is further explored. Finally, the acoustic performance of PCMC is improved further via shape optimization and parameter optimization.", "journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "date": "2024-01-05", "authors": ["XinyuJia", "GuoyongJin", "XuerenWang", "TianguiYe", "YukunChen"], "doi": "10.1121/10.0024238"}

However, research combining P(VDF-TrFE) conduits with drug delivery systems remains sparse. In this study, we developed a novel gastrodin-loaded P(VDF-TrFE)-Eudragit L100-gold nanoparticles (Gas@PT-EL100-AuNPs) nanofiber membrane. Fabricated through electrospinning technique, this composite membrane aimed to investigate the impacts of gastrodin and AuNPs on its properties. Experimental results indicated that the incorporation of gold nanoparticles significantly reduced the fiber diameter of the membrane and enhanced the overall performance by improving hydrophilicity and piezoelectric properties. Specifically, the addition of AuNPs substantially enhanced the piezoelectric performance of the nanofiber membrane. Furthermore, the inclusion of gastrodin not only improved the membrane's hydrophilicity but also enabled effective release of the neuroprotective drug. These findings suggest that the Gas@PT-EL100-AuNPs nanofiber membrane is a novel biomaterial with potential applications in the repair and treatment of nerve injuries.", "journal": "Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials", "date": "2024-01-05", "authors": ["WenShen", "ShangWu", "XuemeiGe", "FenAo", "YueyangMao", "JiaruHu", "PiYan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106355"}

Sleep latency varies considerably both among and within species and is heritable, but lacks a comprehensive description of its underlying genetic network. Here we conduct a genome-wide association study of sleep latency. Using previously collected sleep and activity data on a wild-derived population of flies, we calculate sleep latency, confirming significant, heritable genetic variation for this complex trait. We identify 520 polymorphisms in 248 genes contributing to variability in sleep latency. Tests of mutations in 23 candidate genes and additional putative pan-neuronal knockdown of 9 of them implicated CG44153, Piezo, Proc-R and Rbp6 in sleep latency.

Lastly, we provide our perspectives on the technological applications of such planar hyperbolic polaritons.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2024-01-04", "authors": ["HongweiWang", "AnshumanKumar", "SiyuanDai", "XiaoLin", "ZubinJacob", "Sang-HyunOh", "VinodMenon", "EvgeniiNarimanov", "Young DuckKim", "Jian-PingWang", "PhaedonAvouris", "LuisMartin Moreno", "JoshuaCaldwell", "TonyLow"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-023-43992-8\n10.1515/nanoph-2020-0449\n10.1038/nmat4792\n10.1126/science.aag1992\n10.1038/nature11254\n10.1038/ncomms6221\n10.1021/acsphotonics.8b00776\n10.1038/s41467-021-25941-5\n10.1002/adma.201705318\n10.1038/s41586-020-2359-9\n10.1038/s41467-023-40789-7\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.067402\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.043903\n10.1063/1.3037208\n10.1126/science.1138746\n10.1038/nature14477\n10.1021/acsphotonics.6b00645\n10.1103/PhysRevB.86.155152\n10.1126/science.1246833\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.066804\n10.1038/s41586-018-0618-9\n10.1038/s41467-020-15001-9\n10.1126/science.1114849\n10.1103/PhysRevB.88.045407\n10.1038/nphoton.2013.243\n10.1103/PhysRevB.86.205429\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.56\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b01191\n10.1103/PhysRevB.102.241104\n10.1103/PhysRevB.90.205422\n10.1126/sciadv.aav8690\n10.1103/RevModPhys.90.021001\n10.1038/s41563-020-0665-0\n10.1063/1.5090777\n10.1038/s41586-018-0136-9\n10.1038/nphoton.2013.57\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.127401\n10.1126/science.abe9163\n10.1038/s41565-022-01264-4\n10.1038/s41586-021-03755-1\n10.1117/1.AP.1.5.056003\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03175\n10.1038/nature26160\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.077401\n10.1126/science.1233739\n10.1038/s41467-020-16459-3\n10.1073/pnas.1702683114\n10.1039/C4FD00207E\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02651\n10.1038/s41565-019-0519-6\n10.1038/nnano.2015.131\n10.1002/adma.201900251\n10.1038/s41467-019-12439-4\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c00399\n10.1515/nanoph-2022-0034\n10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01549\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01808\n10.1038/s41565-022-01185-2\n10.1038/s41565-019-0438-6\n10.1038/s41563-022-01422-y\n10.1038/s41467-020-17424-w\n10.1126/science.1174655\n10.1038/s41565-017-0035-5\n10.1038/nnano.2011.54\n10.1038/s41566-017-0051-x\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.077401\n10.1103/PhysRevB.99.201405\n10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.044001\n10.1103/PhysRevB.68.245113\n10.1088/1674-4926/41/12/122502\n10.1038/s41565-018-0063-9\n10.1103/RevModPhys.70.523\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.097601\n10.1038/s41467-020-16291-9\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c02357\n10.1126/science.aad8609\n10.1063/1.4943969\n10.1063/1.4807762\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.097002\n10.1007/s40843-015-0021-x\n10.1103/PhysRevB.98.140502\n10.1038/s41566-018-0189-1\n10.1103/PhysRevB.70.035110\n10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.111401\n10.1073/pnas.1816251115\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.257401\n10.1038/nphoton.2015.123\n10.1126/science.abg2530\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.7.021001\n10.1364/OE.401628\n10.1103/PhysRevApplied.14.014029\n10.1103/PhysRevB.94.075446\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.3221\n10.1038/nature21037\n10.1103/PhysRevB.4.3303\n10.1063/1.4754616\n10.1021/acsphotonics.8b01031\n10.1103/RevModPhys.93.025009\n10.1364/OE.21.015014\n10.1038/s41566-022-01005-y\n10.1038/s41586-023-06598-0\n10.1088/2631-7990/ac64d6\n10.1088/1367-2630/abc988\n10.1002/adma.201704896\n10.1038/s41427-018-0047-0\n10.1515/nanoph-2020-0466\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.233901\n10.1038/lsa.2017.172\n10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03519\n10.1103/PhysRevB.102.035408\n10.1038/s41467-020-18544-z\n10.1126/sciadv.abj0127\n10.1126/science.1202691\n10.1088/2040-8986/aab976\n10.1002/adom.202101919\n10.1038/s41467-020-19499-x\n10.1038/s41598-021-86056-x\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.193902\n10.1103/PhysRevA.100.033840\n10.1038/natrevmats.2016.55\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.116102\n10.1103/PhysRevB.102.045416\n10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.5500\n10.1038/nmat5047\n10.1038/s41467-022-35139-y\n10.1038/s41565-019-0363-8"}

A unique dual-path perception structure is designed that can simultaneously and independently detect two signals of water leakage frequency and water leakage volume. The piezoresistive layer is formed by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which is molded by sandpaper molding. By sensing the deformation caused by the swelling of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs), the water leakage volume can be detected as low as 0.5 mL. The piezoelectric layer is a polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE) film prepared by the spin-coating method, and the water leakage frequency (0.5-4 Hz) is detected by direct contact with water droplets. This work also studied the performance of the double-mode sensor under low temperature and seawater leakage conditions and further verified its reliability in different environments. The design of the new hybrid flexible piezoresistive/piezoelectric double-mode sensor provides a new possibility for water leakage monitoring, such as in submarine tunnels.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2023-12-29", "authors": ["WeiminZhang", "KewenCui", "XingChen", "QianpingRan", "ZengmeiWang"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.3c14498"}

{"title": "Biomaterials regulates BMSCs differentiation via mechanical microenvironment.", "abstract": "Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are crucial for bone tissue regeneration, the mechanical microenvironment of hard tissues, including bone and teeth, significantly affects the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Biomaterials may mimic the microenvironment of the extracellular matrix and provide mechanical signals to regulate BMSCs differentiation via inducing the secretion of various intracellular factors. Biomaterials direct the differentiation of BMSCs via mechanical signals, including tension, compression, shear, hydrostatic pressure, stiffness, elasticity, and viscoelasticity, which can be transmitted to cells through mechanical signalling pathways. Besides, biomaterials with piezoelectric effects regulate BMSCs differentiation via indirect mechanical signals, such as, electronic signals, which are transformed from mechanical stimuli by piezoelectric biomaterials. Mechanical stimulation facilitates achieving vectored stem cell fate regulation, while understanding the underlying mechanisms remains challenging. Herein, this review summarizes the intracellular factors, including translation factors, epigenetic modifications, and miRNA level, as well as the extracellular factor, including direct and indirect mechanical signals, which regulate the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Besides, this review will also give a comprehensive summary about how mechanical stimuli regulate cellular behaviours, as well as how biomaterials promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via mechanical microenvironments. The cellular behaviours and activated signal pathways will give more implications for the design of biomaterials with superior properties for bone tissue engineering.

However, the detailed cellular mechanisms of neural activation are still unclear because studies on micro-stimulation at the cellular level are lacking.\nTo modulate neural activity at the cellular level, we developed a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT), having circular diaphragms for application on acute brain slice preparations. To monitor neural activities, additionally, we fabricated recording microelectrodes onto the same PMUT device for closed-loop application.\nTo examine the PMUT-driven cellular responses of a brain slice, intracellular calcium signals in individual cells were measured using two calcium indicators. We successfully observed the intracellular responses triggered by the ultrasound of our novel PMUT. In addition, we performed recordings of local field potentials in a brain slice, demonstrating its usefulness as a simultaneous recording interface.\nConventional ultrasound stimulators are open-loop systems that risk inducing excessive neural activity because of the absence of neural activity monitoring. In contrast, our PMUT is packaged in a single device with both stimulation and sensor interface for neuromodulation. Further, there are no published reports on in vitro microdevices that can be used for ultrasound stimulation in rodent cortical slices that are several hundred micrometers thick, which maintain the cortical laminar structure and intrinsic neural networks.\nOur findings suggest that this novel PMUT device has the potential for being a powerful tool for in vitro brain slice applications and effective closed loop ultrasound stimulation.", "journal": "Journal of neuroscience methods", "date": "2023-12-28", "authors": ["RyoFurukawa", "TakahiroYoshikawa", "ShuichiMurakami", "TakashiTateno"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jneumeth.2023.110048"}

For efficiently transmitting a strong ELF/SLF radiation signal, the traditional electromagnetic antenna requires a super-large loop (>10\u00a0km). To address this issue, in this work, a piezoelectric ceramic/ferromagnetic heterogeneous structured, cantilever beam-type electric-mechano-magnetic coupled resonator at only centimeter scale for ELF/SLF cross-medium magnetic communication is reported. Through designing hard-soft hybrid step-stiffness elastic beam, the resonator exhibits a much higher quality factor Q (\u2248240) for ELF/SLF magnetic field transmitting, which is one to five orders of magnitude higher than those of previously reported mechanical antennas and loop coil antennas. Moreover, the resonator exhibits a 5000 times higher magnetic field emitting efficiency compared to a conventional loop coil antenna in ELF/SLF band. It also demonstrates a 200% increase in magnetic field emitting capacity compared to existing piezoelectric-driven antennas. In addition, an ASK+PSK modulation method is proposed for suppressing relaxation time of the resonator, and a reduction in the relaxation time by 80% is observed.

{"title": "Roles of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in the renal podocyte injury of experimental hypertensive nephropathy.", "abstract": "Glomerular podocyte injury plays an essential role in proteinuria pathogenesis, a hallmark of chronic kidney disease, including hypertensive nephropathy. Although podocytes are susceptible to mechanical stimuli, their mechanotransduction pathways remain elusive. Piezo proteins, including Piezo1 and 2, are mechanosensing ion channels that mediate various biological phenomena. Although renal Piezo2 expression and its alteration in rodent dehydration and hypertension models have been reported, the role of Piezo1 in hypertensive nephropathy and podocyte injury is unclear. In this study, we examined Piezo1 expression and localization in the kidneys of control mice and in those of mice with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Uninephrectomized, aldosterone-infused, salt-loaded mice developed hypertension, albuminuria, podocyte injury, and glomerulosclerosis. RNAscope in situ hybridization revealed that Piezo1 expression was enhanced in the podocytes, mesangial cells, and distal tubular cells of these mice compared to those of the uninephrectomized, vehicle-infused control group. Piezo1 upregulation in the glomeruli was accompanied by the induction of podocyte injury-related markers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1. These changes were reversed by antihypertensive drug. Exposure of Piezo1-expressing cultured podocytes to mechanical stretch activated Rac1 and upregulated the above-mentioned markers, which was antagonized by the Piezo1 blocker grammostola mechanotoxin #4 (GsMTx4). Administration of Piezo1-specific agonist Yoda1 mimicked the effects of mechanical stretch, which was minimized by the Yoda1-specific inhibitor Dooku1 and Rac inhibitor. Rac1 was also activated in the above-mentioned hypertensive mice, and Rac inhibitor downregulated gene expression of podocyte injury-related markers in vivo.

In this work, we systematically investigated the leaching process and optimum conditions associated with Al removal from the cathode powder materials collected in a wet cathode-powder peeling and recycling production line of spent Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, we specifically studied the leaching of fluorine (F) synergistically happened along with the removal process of Al, which was not concerned about in other studies, but one of the key factors affecting pollution prevention in the recovery process. The mechanism of the whole process including the leaching of Al and F from the cathode powder was indicated by using NMR, FTIR, and XPS, and a defluoridation process was preliminarily investigated in this study. The leaching kinetics of Al could be successfully described by the shrinking core model, controlled by the diffusion process and the activation energy was 11.14 kJ/mol.

{"title": "Atomistic modeling of electromechanical properties of piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowires.", "abstract": "Currently, numerous articles are devoted to examining the influence of geometry and charge distribution on the mechanical properties and structural stability of piezoelectric nanowires (NWs). The varied modeling techniques adopted in earlier molecular dynamics (MD) works dictated the outcome of the different efforts. In this article, comprehensive MD studies are conducted to determine the influence of varied interatomic potentials (partially charged rigid ion model, [PCRIM] ReaxFF, charged optimized many-body [COMB], and Buckingham), geometrical parameters (cross-section geometry, wire diameter, and length), and charge distribution (uniform full charges versus partially charged surface atoms) on the resulting mechanical properties and structural stability of zinc oxide (ZnO) NWs. Our optimized parameters for the Buckingham interatomic potential are in good agreement with the existing experimental results. Furthermore, we found that the incorrect selection of interatomic potentials could lead to excessive overestimate (61%) of the elastic modulus of the NW. While NW length was found to dictate the strain distribution along the wire, impacting its predicted properties, the cross-section shape did not play a major role. Assigning uniform charges for both the core and surface atoms of ZnO NWs leads to a drastic decrease in fracture properties.", "journal": "Nanotechnology", "date": "2023-12-22", "authors": ["S AMeguid", "S IKundalwal", "Ahmed RAlian"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6528/ad1841"}

Though sonodynamic therapy has very promising prospects in cancer treatment, the application of early organic sonosensitizers has been limited in efficacy due to the high blood clearance-rate, poor water solubility, and low stability. Inorganic sonosensitizers have thus been developed, among which piezoelectric semiconductor materials have received increasing attention in sonodynamic therapy due to their piezoelectric properties and strong stability.

{"title": "Piezoelectric Amyloid Fibril for Energy Harvesting, Reactive Oxygen Species Generation, and Wireless Cell Therapy.", "abstract": "Biomolecular piezoelectric materials are envisioned for advanced biomedical applications for their robust piezoelectricity, biocompatibility, and flexibility. Here, we report the piezoelectric property of amyloid fibrils derived from three distinct proteins: lysozyme, insulin, and amyloid-\u03b2. We found that piezoelectric properties are dependent on the extent of the \u03b2-sheet structure and the extent of fibril anisotropy. We have observed the piezoelectric constant value in the range of 24-42 pm/V for fibrils made of lysozyme/insulin/amyloid-\u03b2, and for the sheet/bundle-like structure of lysozyme aggregates, the value becomes 62 pm/V. These piezoelectric constant values are 4-10 times higher than the native lysozyme/insulin/amyloid proteins. Computational studies show that extension of the \u03b2-sheet structure produces an asymmetric arrangement of charges (in creating dipole moment) and mechanical stress induces an aligned orientation of these dipoles that results in a piezoelectric effect. It is shown that these piezoelectric fibrils can harvest mechanical as well as ultrasound-based energy to produce a voltage of up to 1 V and a current of up to 13 nA. These fibrils are employed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound exposure and utilized for ultrasonic degradation of organic pollutants or killing of cancer cells via intracellular ROS generation under ultrasound exposure. Our findings demonstrate that the piezoelectric property of protein fibrils has potential for wireless therapeutic applications and may have physiological roles that are yet to be explored.", "journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "date": "2023-12-21", "authors": ["JayantaDolai", "AnupamMaity", "BuddhadevMukherjee", "ReeddhiRay", "Nikhil RJana"], "doi": "10.1021/acsami.3c14254"}
{"title": "Time-delay control scheme with adaptive fixed-time convergent super-twisting fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode for piezoelectric displacement amplifier.", "abstract": "Piezoelectric displacement amplifiers (PDAs) have been widely used in precision positioning fields. However, the inherent hysteresis and creep nonlinear effect of piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) and time-varying lumped disturbances bring extreme challenges to the precise motion control of PDAs. Although various control schemes based on PEAs have been developed and have shown significant results. However, due to the high sensitivity of precision positioning to environmental variations, the development and identification of accurate models and the control timeliness often become obstacles in engineering. To realize precise motion control of PDAs under complex lumped disturbances, a new time-delay control scheme (AFSTA-FONTSM) using an adaptive fixed-time convergent super-twisting algorithm (AFSTA) and a fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode (FONTSM) is proposed. Specifically, the time-delay information obtained by time-delay estimation technology is used to estimate the lumped dynamic characteristic of the system, thus establishing a simple control framework without a system dynamic model. FONSTM is constructed as a sliding mode manifold, and satisfactory error dynamic characteristic is obtained. A new AFSTA is designed as the reaching law in the sliding mode phase. AFSTA has fixed-time convergence when the upper bound of lumped disturbances exists, which ensures the control timeliness. Benefiting from the newly designed adaptive algorithm, the upper bound value of lumped disturbances is no longer needed to determine the control gains, which effectively prevents overestimation of the control gains. Correspondingly, the convergence time of AFSTA is estimated, and the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by the Lyapunov theory. Three existing time-delay control schemes, namely MSTA-FONTSM, AMSTA-FONTSM, and ASTA-FONTSM are selected, and four scenes are designed for comparative experiments. The experimental results show that MSTA-FONTSM has the worst control performance among the four control schemes. For the step, and continuous cosine trajectories with periods of T\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0s and T\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0s, the root-mean-square error of the proposed AFSTA-FONTSM is reduced by 56.86%, 54.03%, and 50.24% compared with MSTA-FONTSM. For disturbance experiments under different loads, the control performance of the proposed AFSTA-FONTSM is still superior to the other three control schemes without load.", "journal": "ISA transactions", "date": "2023-12-21", "authors": ["ZhichengSong", "LinkangWang", "JieLing", "LingyuWang", "JinjunDuan", "YaoyaoWang", "BaiChen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.isatra.2023.12.017"}

Mechano-gated proteins forming a part of ion channels have been detected in both the axon and terminal glial cells of Meissner corpuscles, a specific cutaneous end organ complex in the human glabrous skin. The main candidates to mechanotransduction in Meissner corpuscles are members of the Piezo family of cationic ion channels. PIEZO2 has been detected in the axon of these sensory structures whereas no data exists about the occurrence and cell localization of PIEZO1.\nSkin samples (n = 18) from the palmar aspect of the distal phalanx of the first and second fingers were analysed (8 female and 10 males; age range 26 to 61 26-61 years). Double immunofluorescence for PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 together with axonal or terminal glial cell markers was captured by laser confocal microscopy, and the percentage of PIEZOs positive Meissner corpuscles was evaluated.\nMCs from human fingers showed variable morphology and degree of lobulation. Regarding the basic immunohistochemical profile, in all cases the axons were immunoreactive for neurofilament proteins, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin, while the lamellar cells displayed strong S100P immunoreactivity. PIEZO1 was detected co-localizing with axonal markers, but never with terminal glial cell markers, in the 56% of Meissner corpuscles; weak but specific immunofluorescence was additionally detected in the epidermis, especially in basal keratinocytes.

PIEZO2 positive Merkel cells were also regularly found.\nPIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are expressed exclusively in the axon of a subpopulation of human digital Meissner corpuscles, thus suggesting that not only PIEZO2, but also PIEZO1 may be involved in the mechanotransduction from low-threshold mechanoreceptors.", "journal": "Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft", "date": "2023-12-19", "authors": ["YolandaGarc\u00eda-Mesa", "PatriciaCuendias", "MartaAlonso-Guerv\u00f3s", "JorgeGarc\u00eda-Piqueras", "Benjam\u00ednMart\u00edn-Biedma", "TeresaCobo", "OliviaGarc\u00eda-Su\u00e1rez", "Jos\u00e9 AVega"], "doi": "10.1016/j.aanat.2023.152200"}
{"title": "Ultrasound-Powered Wireless Underwater Acoustic Identification Tags for Backscatter Communication.", "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations are limited by currently achievable underwater localization and navigation solutions; hence, the development of low-cost and passive (i.e., operable without an active power supply) acoustic underwater markers (or tags) can provide accurate localization information to AUVs improving their situational awareness, especially when operating in small scales or confined missions. This work presents an acoustic identification (AID) tag that can be powered wirelessly with ultrasonic power transfer from a remote acoustic source (e.g., mounted on an interrogating AUV) and provide localization information using backscatter communication. The AID tag harvests energy from the acoustic signal generated from the AUV and communicates by modulating the reflected signals from an embedded piezoelectric transducer. A scaled broadband AID tag prototype that achieves concurrent acoustic energy harvesting (tuned around 1.3 MHz) and backscatter communication (in wider frequency band 600 and 800 kHz) using frequency-domain multiplexing is implemented using a custom broadband impedance matching-based transducer design approach. During concurrent power and data operation, this prototype AID tag achieves data rates up to 200 kb/s using amplitude- and frequency-based modulation communication. The use of broadband schemes to achieve robust communications in low SNR (tested here down to -6 dB) is also demonstrated using linear frequency-modulated data carriers.

{"title": "Tumor microenviroment-responsive self-assembly of barium titanate nanoparticles with enhanced piezoelectric catalysis capabilities for efficient tumor therapy.", "abstract": "Catalytic therapy based on piezoelectric nanoparticles has become one of the effective strategies to eliminate tumors. However, it is still a challenge to improve the tumor delivery efficiency of piezoelectric nanoparticles, so that they can penetrate normal tissues while specifically aggregating at tumor sites and subsequently generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to achieve precise and efficient tumor clearance. In the present study, we successfully fabricated tumor microenvironment-responsive assembled barium titanate nanoparticles (tma-BTO NPs): in the neutral pH environment of normal tissues, tma-BTO NPs were monodisperse and possessed the ability to cross the intercellular space; whereas, the acidic environment of the tumor triggered the self-assembly of tma-BTO NPs to form submicron-scale aggregates, and deposited in the tumor microenvironment. The self-assembled tma-BTO NPs not only caused mechanical damage to tumor cells; more interestingly, they also exhibited enhanced piezoelectric catalytic efficiency and produced more ROS than monodisperse nanoparticles under ultrasonic excitation, attributed to the mutual extrusion of neighboring particles within the confined space of the assembly. tma-BTO NPs exhibited differential cytotoxicity against tumor cells and normal cells, and the stronger piezoelectric catalysis and mechanical damage induced by the assemblies resulted in significant apoptosis of mouse breast cancer cells (4T1); while there was little damage to mouse embryo osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1) under the same treatment conditions. Animal experiments confirmed that peritumoral injection of tma-BTO NPs combined with ultrasound therapy can effectively inhibit tumor progression non-invasively.

{"title": "Comprehensive review of the global trends and future perspectives for recycling of decommissioned photovoltaic panels.", "abstract": "With the rapid deployment of renewable energy using photovoltaic (PV) panels, the sustainable management of decommissioned PV modules has become challenging. Decommissioned modules contain heavy metals, such as copper, cadmium, and lead, and hazardous polymer substances, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinylidene fluoride, which can pose a serious threat to the environment if disposed in a landfill. In addition, the low concentration value of critical metals, such as silver, indium, and tellurium, can also be lost. In this context, recycling decommissioned PV panels can be useful to resource recovery of valuable metals while lowering environmental stress. However, the lower share of PV modules and the prolonged life of 25-30\u00a0years compared to other waste volumes (e.g., electronic waste) hinder the progress in this direction. In contrast, reaching the end-of-life of the deployed first-generation PV panels is creating attraction toward the recycling of decommissioned modules. Henceforth, exploring the commercial viability of PV recycling necessitates a review of the methodologies that have been investigated on a laboratory scale and have the potential to be up-scaled. In this review, the recent trends in various PV-recycling steps, including frame disassembly, delamination, metal extraction, and recovery, are underlined while the associated problems are determined to suggest the required improvements in future technology.

Herein, we identified the sole PIEZO in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), utilizing amino acid homology analysis and Trans-Membrane prediction using Hidden Markov Models (TMHMM). In C. elegans, RNAi knockdown of pezo-1 had no impact on lifespan, body length, lethality, locomotion behaviors, or oxidative response (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). However, exposure to 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L nanopolystyrene in the pezo-1 RNAi group resulted in severe locomotion changes: head trashes (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), body bends (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), forward turns (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), backward turns (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and impaired sensory perception, including abnormal chemotaxis to NaCl (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and diacetyl (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), as well as aversive responses (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) to nanopolystyrene compared to the wild-type group.

To settle such dilemma, this study successfully constructed a robust and environmentally-friendly MOFs-COFs hybrid-based membrane (FS-50/COF(MATPA)-MOF(Zr)/PDA@PVDF) for the first time through solution synthesis and solvothermal method, combined with surface modification of FS-50 molecule. Importantly, we employed a simple two-step strategy to obtain the high-aspect-ratio MOFs fibers: (1) solvent regulation to generate smaller needle-like whiskers during the in-situ growth of MOFs on COFs; (2) high pressure induced directional crystallization in filtration process. The introduction of polydopamine (PDA) greatly improved the adhesion between coating and PVDF membrane. The in-situ growth of high length-diameter ratio MOFs fibers on blocky COFs greatly enhanced the specific surface area of MOFs-COFs hybrid, thus provided sufficient absorption sites. The functional groups of FS-50 endowed the hybrid membrane with superhydrophilicity and superoleophobicity, which facilitated to selectively penetrate water molecules and repel non-polar pollutants. The separation efficiency and decontamination mechanism of hybrid membrane to the simulated oily wastewater (containing various MPs, dyes, and pesticides) were investigated through experiments and theoretical calculations. The hybrid membrane could selectively and synchronously adsorb various dyes (20 mg/L-120\u00a0mg/L, almost 100% removal) and pesticides (10\u00a0mg/L for DIF and TET, adsorption rates 93.2% and 90.9%, respectively) from oil-water emulsion (50\u00a0mL).

By this HAL structure, the displacement and electric displacement are well confined in the piezoelectric layer. A lower mechanical loss of Qz than that of lossy amorphous SiO2 further enhances the quality ( Q ) factor. In addition, a negative temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of LN is compensated by selecting the crystalline orientation of Qz with a positive TCF. According to simulation results, the Euler angles of (0\u00b0, 101\u00b0, and 0\u00b0) and the normalized thickness of 0.2-0.3 \u03bb (wavelength) for LN are selected to obtain a higher impedance ratio ( Z -ratio) and bandwidth (BW). The Euler angles of (0\u00b0, 160\u00b0, and 90\u00b0) for Qz are selected to obtain the positive maximum TCF. The fabricated resonator exhibits a Z -ratio of 95 dB and a BW of 15.9% in the 700 MHz range. The fit figure of merit (FoM) reaches 410, which is the best level ever reported for an LN-based resonator. The TCF of the resonator is -77 ppm/\u00b0C at anti-resonance frequency. A group of resonators composed of LN and LN/Qz with thin and thick electrodes were fabricated to further illustrate the good performance of LN/Qz.

{"title": "An active piezoelectric plane X-ray focusing mirror with a linearly changing thickness.", "abstract": "X-ray mirrors for synchrotron radiation are often bent into a curved figure and work under grazing-incidence conditions due to the strong penetrating nature of X-rays to most materials. Mirrors of different cross sections have been recommended to reduce the mirror's slope inaccuracy and clamping difficulty in order to overcome mechanical tolerances. With the development of hard X-ray focusing, it is difficult to meet the needs of focusing mirrors with small slope error with the existing mirror processing technology. Deformable mirrors are adaptive optics that can produce a flexible surface figure. A method of using a deformable mirror as a phase compensator is described to enhance the focusing performance of an X-ray mirror. This paper presents an active piezoelectric plane X-ray focusing mirror with a linearly changing thickness that has the ability of phase compensation while focusing X-rays. Benefiting from its special structural design, the mirror can realize flexible focusing at different focusing geometries using a single input driving voltage. A prototype was used to measure its performance under one-dimension and two-dimension conditions. The results prove that, even at a bending magnet beamline, the mirror can easily achieve a single-micrometre focusing without a complicated bending mechanism or high-precision surface processing.

Collagens are the most abundant components of the ECM. Type I, IV, V and VI collagen has been detected in pancreatic islets, and each type plays important role in the proliferation, survival, function and differentiation of pancreatic cells. In some cases, collagens show behaviours similar to those of growth factors and regulate the biological behaviour of \u03b2 cells by binding with certain growth factors, including IGFs, EGFs and FGFs. The transcriptional coactivator YAP/TAZ has been widely recognised as a mechanosensor that senses changes in the physical characteristics of the ECM and inhibition of YAP/TAZ enhances insulin production and secretion. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease characterised by the destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells. The crosstalk between collagens and immune cells plays a key role in the development and differentiation of immune cells. Further, Supplementation with collagens during islet transplantation is a promising strategy for improving the quality of the islets.

{"title": "A cascaded Nitinol Langevin transducer for resonance stability at elevated temperatures.", "abstract": "Across power ultrasonics and sensing, piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers commonly experience degradation in mechanical, electrical, and dynamic performance due to the relatively high sensitivity of piezoelectric materials to changes in temperature. These changes, arising for example through high excitation voltages or environmental conditions, can lead to nonlinear dynamic behaviours which compromise device performance. To overcome this, the excitation signal to the piezoelectric material is often pulsed, mitigating the influence of temperature rises. However, there remain constraints on suitable candidate piezoelectric materials for power ultrasonic devices. As a novel approach to mitigating the influence of temperature on the properties of piezoelectric materials, the phase-transforming shape memory alloy Nitinol is incorporated into the piezoelectric stack of a Langevin power ultrasonic transducer, in a cascade formation. The underlying principle is that the nonlinear hardening response of Nitinol to rising temperature can be used to dynamically compensate for the nonlinear softening of the piezoelectric materials. Thus, the dynamic response of the transducer can be linearised at elevated excitation levels. In this study, two configurations of Langevin transducer are designed and characterised. One transducer incorporates a Nitinol middle mass, and in the second, titanium. A combination of electrical and thermomechanical characterisation is undertaken, where it is demonstrated that the nonlinear softening of the piezoelectric stack can be mitigated through control of the Nitinol microstructure. The vibration amplitudes of the Nitinol-middle cascaded transducer are higher and more stable when the Nitinol is austenite rather than a combination of martensite and austenite at room temperature. It has also been shown that the vibration amplitude and resonance frequency of Nitinol-middle cascaded transducer remain stable as temperature changes from 20 \u00b0C to 45 \u00b0C, dependent of the excitation voltage. Moreover, the self-heating experiment demonstrates the resonance stability of the Nitinol-middle cascaded transducer for continuous operation.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2023-11-18", "authors": ["YuchenLiu", "MahshidHafezi", "AndrewFeeney"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2023.107201"}

However, the potential of this approach has rarely been assessed in facilitating the distribution of liquids within those porous substrates to fabricate composite membranes in typical interfacial polymerization. In this work, we demonstrate the advantages of vacuum-assisted interfacial polymerization (VAIP) in terms of substrate universality, monomer concentration range, and performance reproducibility in the fabrication of polyimide nanofiltration membranes. Aqueous solutions of PIP can be homogeneously distributed by vacuum filtration on diverse microfiltration substrates of polyether sulfone (PES), Nylon-66, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), cellulose acetate (CA), and mixed cellulose esters (MCE), respectively.

{"title": "Potential Application of Organic Electronics in Electrical Sensing of Insects and Integrated Pest Management towards Developing Ecofriendly Replacements for Chemical Insecticides.", "abstract": "Synthetic insecticides are widely used against plant pest insects to protect the crops. However, many insecticides have poor selectivity and are toxic also to beneficial insects, animals, and humans. In addition, insecticide residues can remain on fruits for many days, jeopardizing food safety. For these reasons, a reusable, low-cost electronic trap that can attract, detect, and identify, but attack only the pest while leaving beneficial insects unharmed could provide a sustainable, nature-friendly replacement. Here, for the first time, research results are presented suggesting the great potential and compatibility of organic electronic devices and technologies with pest management. Electrical characterizations confirm that an insect's body has relatively high dielectric permittivity. Adaptive memcapacitor circuits can track the impedance change for insect detection. Other experiments show that printed polymer piezoelectric transducers on a plastic substrate can collect information about the weight and activity of insects for identification. The breakdown voltage of most insects\u00b4 integument is measured to be <200\u00a0V. Long channel organic transistors easily work at such high voltages while being safe to touch for humans thanks to their inherent low current.

{"title": "Supramolecular Organic Ferroelectric Materials from Donor-Acceptor Systems.", "abstract": "Organic ferroelectric (FE) materials, though known for more than a century, are yet to reach close to the benchmark of inorganic or hybrid materials in terms of the magnitude of polarization. Amongst the different classes of organic systems, donor (D)-acceptor (A) charge-transfer (CT) complexes are recognized as promising for ferroelectricity owing to their neutral-to-ionic phase transition at low temperature. This review presents an overview of different supramolecular D-A systems that have been explored for FE phase transitions. The discussion begins with a general introduction of ferroelectricity and its different associated parameters. Then it moves on to show early examples of CT cocrystals that have shown FE properties at sub-ambient temperature. Subsequently, recent developments in the field of room temperature (RT) ferroelectricity, exhibited by H-bond-stabilized lock-arm supramolecular-ordering (LASO) in D-A co-crystals or other FE CT-crystals devoid of neutral-ionic phase transition are discussed. Then the discussion moves on to emerging reports on other D-A soft materials such as gel and foldable polymers; finally it shows very recent developments in ferroelectricity in supramolecular assemblies of single-component dipolar or ambipolar \u03c0-systems, exhibiting intra-molecular charge transfer. The effects of structural nuances such as H-bonding, balanced charge transfer and chirality on the observed ferroelectricity is described with the available examples.

NC-PVDF presented rougher surface (increased by at least 18.3\u00a0%), higher porosity and crystallinity compared to PVDF membrane.

{"title": "Porous polyvinyl fluoride coated cellulose beads for efficient removal of Cd(II) from phosphoric acid.", "abstract": "In order to enhance the removal of cadmium from phosphoric acid, it is imperative to explore novel resources that may be utilized for the development of highly effective and environmentally sustainable adsorbents. Cellulose beads are composed of naturally occurring polysaccharide fibers and find extensive utilization across several industrial sectors and applications. Within this framework, this research paper presents a green and simple method for producing porous cellulose beads using date palm fibers as the preferred raw material. The innovation lies in immersing the obtained cellulose beads in a Polyvinyl fluoride (PVDF)/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) suspension as a coating polymer with different concentrations (2.5, 5, 10\u00a0%) to maintain their stability in an acidic environment. The surface of cellulose/PVDF beads were subjected to multiple characterizations like Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), size distribution then pH stability confirming that the coating has been perfectly achieved and conserved well the shape of the beads. The coated cellulose/PVDF-2.5\u00a0% underwent evaluation by the process of batch adsorption experiments while different parameters were varied including contact time (5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90\u00a0min), temperature (25, 35, 45 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C), and adsorbent mass (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100\u00a0mg). The obtained ICP data showed that the adsorption rate of Cd (II) from phosphoric acid medium decreased while increasing both temperature from 25 to 55\u00a0\u00b0C and contact time from 5 to 90\u00a0min while adding more adsorbent dosage from 20 to 100\u00a0mg enhanced the removal percentage. The cellulose/PVDF-2.5\u00a0% was more effective with an adsorption capacity equal to 3.4998\u00a0mg/g at optimal conditions including 25\u00a0\u00b0C as the temperature after 5\u00a0min as contact time and by adding a mass 100\u00a0mg of the biosorbent while the pH\u00a0=\u00a02 of the solution is maintained the same. The examined material's adsorption processes proved to be exothermic and non-spontaneous, and it proved that the pseudo-second-order model provided the best match for the cellulose/PVDF-2.5\u00a0% beads kinetics data. Furthermore, the cellulose beads exhibited exceptional reusability for up to four repeated cycles without undergoing desorption. The present study offers a viable approach for producing environmentally sustainable biomass-derived adsorbents.

To bolster the \u03b5' of raw Zn (zinc)/poly(vinylidene fluoride, PVDF) while maintaining pimping dielectric loss, in this study, the core@double-shell structured Zn@zinc carbonate (ZnCH)@polystyrene (PS) particles are first synthesized through a suspension polymerization of styrene, and then composited with PVDF to elevate the \u03b5' and keep low loss of the composites. By optimizing the PS shells' thickness and tailoring the electrical resistivity of Zn@ZnCH@PS particles, both the slow inter-particle polarization and fast intra-particle polarization in the composites can be decoupled and synergistically tuned, thus, the Zn@ZnCH@PS/PVDF achieves a much higher \u03b5' and lower dielectric loss, simultaneously, which far exceed the unmodified Zn/PVDF. Both experiment and theoretic calculation reveal that the double-shell ZnCH@PS not only induces and promotes multiple polarizations enhancing the composites' \u03b5', especially at the optimized PS's thickness, but also maintains suppressed loss and conductivity thanks to their obvious barrier effect on long-range charge migration.

Its inherent limitations of low signal-to-noise ratio, limited specificity and susceptibility to noise, however, hinder successful implementation. Ultrasound provides a possible alternative, but current systems with medical probes are expense, bulky and non-wearable. This work proposes an innovative prosthetic control strategy based on a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) hardware system. Two PMUT-based probes were developed, comprising a 23\u00d726 PMUT array and encapsulated in Ecoflex material. These compact and wearable probes represent a significant improvement over traditional ultrasound probes as they weigh only 1.8 grams and eliminate the need for ultrasound gel. A preliminary test of the probes was performed in non-disabled subjects performing 12 different hand gestures. The two probes were placed perpendicular to the flexor digitorum superficialis and brachioradialis muscles, respectively, to transmit/receive pulse-echo signals reflecting muscle activities. Hand gesture was correctly predicted 96% of the time with only these two probes. The adoption of the PMUT-based strategy greatly reduced the required number of channels, amount of processing circuit and subsequent analysis.

Current methods for pathogenic bacteria detection have some problems in accurate, rapid and universal application. Here we proposed a pathogenic bacteria series piezoelectric quartz crystal (SPQC) sensor for achieving highly specific and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria. The universal sequences of common clinical pathogens screened by our group were used as detection targets. A new TALEs nuclease was synthesized as a recognition element, which recognizes double-stranded DNA at the level of a single base mismatch in the range of 17-19 bases. Targets could be specifically recognized by TALEs, resulting in the change of electrode surface, which would be further amplified by hybridization chain reaction and silver staining technique. Finally, the changes would be detected by SPQC system. This strategy was demonstrated to have excellent performance, enabling sensitive detection of targets with a detection limit of 25\u00a0cfu/mL in less than 3\u00a0h. What's more, the identification of single base mismatch could be achieved when the target ranging in length between 17 and 19 bases.

{"title": "Technical note: High-efficient and wireless transcranial ultrasound excitation based on electromagnetic acoustic transducer.", "abstract": "The generation of transcranial ultrasound is usually based on the piezoelectric effect, so it is necessary to attach transducers around the skull. However, the skull will cause serious attenuation and scattering of ultrasound, which makes it particularly difficult for transcranial ultrasound imaging and modulation.\nIn transcranial ultrasound imaging, there is significant attenuation and scattering of ultrasound waves by the skull bone. To mitigate this influence and enable precise imaging and high-efficient transcranial ultrasound for specific patients (such as stroke patients who already require craniotomy as part of their surgical care), this paper proposes to use EMAT to excite metal plates placed inside the skull based on the excellent penetration characteristics of EM waves into the skull, generating ultrasound signals, which can completely avoid the influence of skull on ultrasound transmission.\nBased on an efficient wireless transcranial ultrasound experimental platform, we first verified that the skull would not affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves generated by EMAT.

{"title": "Methodology of using acoustic emissions for enhancing rodent behavioral analysis.", "abstract": "Rodent models of behavior used in the fields of neuroscience and psychology generate a wealth of multimodal data. For instance, as a rodent moves and behaves in its environment, muscle contractions apply subtle forces to any surface the animal contacts. These forces generate acoustic waves that propagate through the waveguide as Lamb and shear horizontal (SH) waves and contain information about the rodent's physiology, behavior, and underlying psychological state. If the information in these waves were to be tapped, it would provide a novel, non-invasive way to study rodent behavior. This article lays the foundations for using guided ultrasonic waves generated by a mouse's movement on an aluminum plate for detecting behavior and drawing inferences about acoustic startle responses. The experimental setup involves piezoelectric sensors capturing the waves generated by the rodent's movement, which are then stored as discrete acoustic emission (AE) hits using an amplitude threshold-based data acquisition system. This method of data acquisition ensures that data collection occurs only when the animal moves or behaves, and each movement/behavior is represented by values of features within the generated wavepackets (AE hits). Through open field tests with C57BL/6J mice, utilizing piezoelectric sensors and the DAQ system, it was observed that every movement/behavior of the animal generated Lamb wavepackets within the frequency range of 20 kHz to 100 kHz. Furthermore, rearing behavior in the animals also led to the generation of SH wavepackets in the frequency range of 75 kHz to 230 kHz. This criterion was subsequently employed to detect rearing behavior. In the acoustic startle response test, where the animals' responses to intense sound pulse were recorded, AE hits' features proved useful in quantifying the response. These experimental findings validate the proposed technology's practicality and demonstrate its capability to enhance studies of rodent behavior.", "journal": "Ultrasonics", "date": "2023-10-09", "authors": ["PShivashankar", "NNocera", "SLivadiotis", "SMozaffar", "M RDrew", "SSalamone"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ultras.2023.107170"}

The behavior of microalgal-bacterial biofilms immobilized on microporous substrates remains as a research challenge, particularly in uncovering their mutualistic interactions in environment enriched with dissolved organic matter. Therefore, this study established a novel culture platform by introducing microalgal-derived bio-coating that preconditioned hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride membranes for the microalgal-bacterial biofilm growth of freshwater microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris ESP 31 and marine microalgae, Cylindrotheca fusiformis with bacteria, Escherichia coli. In the attached co-culture mode, the bio-coating we proposed demonstrated the ability to enhance microalgal growth for both studied species by a range of 2.5\u00a0% to 19\u00a0% starting from day 10 onwards. Additionally, when compared to co-culture on uncoated membranes, the bio-coating exhibited a significant bacterial growth promotion effect, increasing bacterial growth by at least 2.35 times for the C. vulgaris-E. coli co-culture after an initial adaptation phase. A significant increase of at least 72\u00a0% in intracellular biochemical compounds (including chlorophyll, polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids) was observed within just five days, primarily due to the high concentration of pre-coated organic matter, mainly sourced from the internal organic matter (IOM) of C. fusiformis. Higher accumulation of organic compounds in the bio-coating indirectly triggers a competition between microalgae and bacteria which potentially stimulate the production of additional intra-/extra-organic substances as a defensive response.

Bias and 95% limits of agreement between the respiratory rate measured using capnography (standard reference) and that measured using the other three methods were calculated using Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measures. Clarke error grid (CEG) analysis evaluated the sensor's ability to assist in correct clinical decision-making.\nEighteen participants were included, and 2,307 data points were analyzed.

These acoustofluidic patterning functions can be achieved within a polymer chamber or a glass capillary with various cross-sections positioned along the wave propagating paths. In this paper, we demonstrated that microparticles can be aligned, patterned, and concentrated within both circular and rectangular glass capillaries using TSAWs based on a piezoelectric thin film acoustic wave platform. The glass capillary was placed at different angles along with the interdigital transducer directions. We systematically investigated effects of tilting angles and wave characteristics using numerical simulations in both circular and square shaped capillaries, and the patterning mechanisms were discussed and compared with those agitated under the SSAWs. We then experimentally verified the particle patterns within different glass capillaries using thin film ZnO SAW devices on aluminum (Al) sheets. Results show that the propagating SAWs can generate acoustic pressures and patterns in the fluid due to the diffractive effects, drag forces and ARF, as functions of the SAW device's resonant frequency and tilting angle.

{"title": "Effect of electric impedance on the electromechanical characteristics of tunable spherical piezoelectric transducer.", "abstract": "Spherical piezoelectric transducers are a critical component of ultrasonic vibration systems with significant applications in various practical scenarios such as underwater acoustic detection and structural health monitoring. The existing spherical piezoelectric transducers have fixed electromechanical characteristics that limit their applications in scenarios with multi-frequency or frequency variation requirements. It would therefore be intriguing, from the viewpoints of both science and technology, to break through this limit by introducing external electric load impedance. Here we propose a tunable spherical piezoelectric transducer (TSPT) capable of adjusting the electromechanical characteristics by changing the resistance, inductance, and capacitance applied to the passive piezoceramic shell. The theoretical and numerical results show that when the resistance is exerted on the inner and outer piezoceramic shells, the resonance is accompanied by large variations at low values of resistance, while it becomes almost constant at high values of resistance. When the inductance is exerted on the outer piezoceramic shell, the resonance frequency obtained by the finite element method can be changed from 72730\u00a0Hz to 42928\u00a0Hz by adjusting the inductance, indicating that the TSPT can realize a rich and selective resonance frequency region. The resonance/antiresonance frequency decreases while the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient increases, when the capacitance applied on the inner and outer piezoceramic shells increases. The experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed TSPT, which is in agreement with the simulated results and theoretical predictions.

{"title": "An Ultrasound Array of Emitter-Receiver Stacks for Microbubble-Based Therapy.", "abstract": "Most therapeutic ultrasound devices place emitters and receivers in separate locations, so that the long therapeutic pulses (>1 ms) can be emitted while receivers monitor the procedure. However, with such placement, emitters and receivers are competing for the same space, producing a trade-off between emission efficiency and reception sensitivity. Taking advantage of recent studies demonstrating that short-pulse ultrasound can be used therapeutically, we aimed to develop a device that overcomes such trade-offs. The array was composed of emitter-receiver stacks, which enabled both emission and reception from the same location. Each element was made of a lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) stack. The PZT (frequency: 500 kHz, diameter: 16 mm) was used for emission and the PVDF (thickness: 28 \u03bcm, diameter: 16 mm) for broadband reception. 32 elements were assembled in a 3D-printed dome-shaped frame (focal length: 150 mm; [Formula: see text]-number: 1) and was tested in free-field and through an ex-vivo human skull. In free-field, the array had a 4.5 \u00d7 4.5 \u00d7 32 mm focus and produced a peak-negative pressure (PNP) of 2.12 MPa at its geometric center.

Herein, a SERS aptasensor based on a flexible substrate was established for effective carbendazim (CBZ) detection on apple peel. In this sensor, electrospun PVDF/CQDs film served as a flexible supporting substrate. AuNS@Ag was liquid-liquid self-assembled on the PVDF/CQDs film to form a uniform and highly active SERS substrate. During the detection process, aptamers specifically capture the CBZ molecules, while nitrile-mediated Raman tag (MMBN) linked to AuNPs provided optical anti-interference signals. The results showed that the developed sensor had high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability for CBZ detection. Importantly, the flexibility of the SERS substrate helped the sensor realize non-invasive CBZ detection at a concentration as low as 1.20\u00a0ng/cm", "journal": "Food chemistry", "date": "2023-08-16", "authors": ["XiaoouWei", "WenjunSong", "YushanFan", "YueSun", "ZhihuaLi", "ShiqiChen", "JiyongShi", "DiZhang", "XiaoboZou", "XuechaoXu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2023.137120"}
{"title": "Viral nanoparticles: Current advances in design and development.", "abstract": "Viral nanoparticles (VNPs) are self-assembling, adaptable delivery systems for vaccines and other therapeutic agents used in a variety of biomedical applications. The potential of viruses to invade and infect various hosts and cells renders them suitable as potential nanocarriers, possessing distinct functional characteristics, immunogenic properties, and improved biocompatibility and biodegradability. VNPs are frequently produced through precise genetic or chemical engineering, which involves adding diverse sequences or functional payloads to the capsid protein (CP). Several spherical and helical plant viruses, bacteriophages, and animal viruses are currently being used as VNPs, or non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs). In addition to their broad use in cancer therapy, vaccine technology, diagnostics, and molecular imaging, VNPs have made important strides in the realms of tissue engineering, biosensing, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. They are also being used in energy storage cells due to their binding and piezoelectric properties. The large-scale production of VNPs for research, preclinical testing, and clinical use is fraught with difficulties, such as those relating to cost-effectiveness, scalability, and purity. Consequently, many plants- and microorganism-based platforms are being developed, and newer viruses are being explored.

Different from previous reported studies, by patterning annular electrodes on this kind of 1-3 composite, a five-element annular-array transducer in diameter of 6 mm was designed and successfully fabricated and its working center frequency was increased from 5 MHz to around 15 MHz. Meanwhile, a -6 dB bandwidth of 50% was achieved for each annular-array element via a pulse-echo response measurement. Moreover, the obtained annular-array transducer exhibits low crosstalk (<-40 dB) and a high electromechanical coupling coefficient of around 0.7. The application of ultrasonic imaging was further demonstrated to show its excellent performance.

The interproximal bone defects were accessed with a single (lingual) flap, and the bone architecture was modified by the adoption of piezoelectric inserts for controlled bone recontouring associated with fiber retention. Mean probing depth (PD) was 5.5 \u00b1 0.8 mm before surgery and 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 mm at the 6-month reevaluation. All treated pockets showed a postsurgical PD < 4 mm. Gingival recession (REC) was 0.3 \u00b1 0.5 mm at baseline and increased to 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 mm at 6 months. When buccal and lingual pockets were analyzed separately, a trend toward a similar PD reduction, less REC increase, and greater clinical attachment level gain was recorded for buccal pockets.

All transducers operate at 12 MHz at third harmonic frequency, having an outer diameter of 20 mm, a central hole of 5 mm in diameter, and a radius of curvature of 15 mm. The electroacoustic efficiency determined by a radiation force balance is evaluated in a range of input power levels up to 15 W. Schlieren tomography as well as hydrophone measurements are used for evaluation of the acoustic field distribution. It is found that the average electroacoustic efficiency of NBT-based transducers is approximately 40%, while it is around 80% in the PZT-based devices. NBT devices show significantly higher inhomogeneity of the acoustic field under schlieren tomography compared to PZT devices. From pressure measurements in the prefocal plane, it was found that the inhomogeneity could be attributed to depoling of significant areas of the NBT piezo-component during the fabrication process.

According to the MBR results, at the end of the operation process, TMP levels of the membrane from the blending method are found 150 mbar, membrane from high molecular weight PVDF polymer had 250 mbar, and membrane from low molecular weight PVDF polymer had 800 mbar. As a consequence of the investigation, it is seen that the hydrophilic structure of the membrane allows the pollutant to adsorb less to the blend membrane surface, and the lower roughness is also a factor in reducing fouling.", "journal": "Environmental technology", "date": "2022-08-11", "authors": ["GizemTuncay", "T\u00fcrkerT\u00fcrken", "\u0130smailKoyuncu"], "doi": "10.1080/09593330.2022.2112092"}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Ultrasound is an imaging modality that has been in clinical use for approximately 50 years. Sokolov first described the potential for using this technology to produce low-resolution images in 1939. Later understanding of the piezoelectric effect and further technological refinements have resulted in machine advancements. We have seen the machine sizes dramatically decrease; some of the earliest machines were the size of refrigerators while recently we have seen the introduction of transducers that are\u00a0compatible with smartphones. Although ultrasound technology can be utilized in a variety of different settings and body locations,\u00a0the focus of this article will be on transabdominal ultrasound, its definition, indications and diagnostic pearls and pitfalls. Transabdominal ultrasound was initially\u00a0utilized in its most colloquial setting of pregnancy in the 1960s. It is now\u00a0utilized for visualization of multiple abdominal organs, both intraperitoneal\u00a0and retroperitoneal. By\u00a0definition,\u00a0any evaluation with an ultrasound transducer overlying the abdominal wall can be considered a transabdominal ultrasound. Transabdominal ultrasound can\u00a0be applied to\u00a0visualize the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, small and large intestine, appendix, bladder, uterus, adnexa, spleen, stomach, aorta, and IVC. In the setting of obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN), the transabdominal approach is usually performed to evaluate for possible pelvic pathology or pregnancy in a less invasive manner. In the emergency department (ED) a transabdominal ultrasound is most commonly utilized to evaluate for intrauterine pregnancy, cholelithiasis, intraabdominal free fluid, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and hydronephrosis.\u00a0 Emergency physicians (EPs) perform a limited point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in comparison to formal radiology transabdominal ultrasounds. The EP performs the former compared to the latter, and a trained sonographer performs a thorough and complete examination of the organ. ED POCUS is focused on binary questions that are rapidly evaluated at the bedside and direct patient care immediately. For example: \u201cIs there an intrauterine pregnancy?\u201d In most cases when an intrauterine pregnancy is identified, the examination is complete. While both EPs and sonographers perform a transabdominal ultrasound, the performance characteristics and goals vary.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["AmiKurzweil", "JenniferMartin"], "doi": null}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "The first documented and published use of ultrasound began in 1958 when a team led by Ian Donald in Glasgow first utilized sonography as a diagnostic tool in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Today, patients benefit from a wide range of sonographic uses. Due to the lack of radiation, low cost, and portability, fetal monitoring, joint injections, arterial line placements, and diagnoses of joint pathology are some of the many uses of ultrasound as an imaging and diagnostic modality. However, technological advancements and engineering have also allowed ultrasound to become a therapeutic modality. Most classically, continuous therapeutic ultrasound has been used to treat various musculoskeletal pathologies like osteoarthritis, soft tissue shoulder pathology, and myofascial pain. Ultrasound use has also expanded into atrial ablation, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, accelerate fracture healing, limited rhytidectomy, and, when paired with MRI, can be used to treat benign and malignant soft tissues tumors. Within this activity, we will focus on the physical principles and theories that form the basis for ultrasound therapies, the interactions between the ultrasound and human anatomy, indications of use, safety concerns, and its utility amongst the healthcare team. Therapeutic ultrasound relies on a variety of power settings and comes from numerous manufacturers, but the principles remain the same; the ultrasound machine conducts an electrical signal through crystals found in the head of the ultrasound probe. The crystals vibrate and create mechanical waves at frequencies outside the range of human hearing (20 hertz to 20000 hertz). This phenomenon is known as the \u2018piezoelectric effect.\u2019 The waves produced transfer energy to the surface of the human body or may be\u00a0focused to target soft tissue deep to the epidermis. Tissues containing a higher content of proteins (muscle and bone) absorb the energy from the mechanical waves at a higher rate than tissues with higher water content (fat). Additionally, the energy from the ultrasound may be focused to\u00a0affect tissues deep to the surface without causing harm to more superficial tissues. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy is a common procedure that demonstrates this mechanism.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["Michael J.Matthews", "Michael F.Stretanski"], "doi": null}
{"title": "StatPearls", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is well suited for use in clinical practice given its affordability, portability, and lack of radiation exposure for image acquisition. These features allow clinicians from almost any specialty the ability to perform image-guided evaluations and interventions.\u00a0Radiologists are uniquely suited to perform these types of evaluations and procedures given their extensive training, knowledge of human anatomy, and understanding of varied anatomical appearances on multiple imaging modalities. Part of a radiologist\u2019s training comprises an understanding of medical physics, including how medical images are obtained. In ultrasound, the sonographer or physician utilizes a transducer to interrogate the area of interest.\u00a0Within the transducer are piezoelectric crystals that vibrate when exposed to an alternating current. These vibrations generate sound waves transmitted into the patient\u2019s soft tissues via a layer of ultrasound gel. The sound waves then interact with the tissue and are ultimately reflected back to the transducer. Once the sound waves return to the transducer, they are converted back into an electric current. The computer then calculates the time interval between when the sound wave was initially generated and when it was received back at the transducer to determine the location (depth) of the tissue, which reflected the sound wave. When planning a procedure, one must consider the type of transducer which will yield the highest quality images.\u00a0 There are a variety of transducers that can be used with varied frequency and shape. In general, higher frequency transducers are utilized for imaging more superficial structures as they offer better resolution. However, the higher frequency sound wave is more easily attenuated and has decreased ability to penetrate tissue, limiting their use in the evaluation of deeper structures. \u00a0For deeper structures or larger patients, one might choose a lower frequency or curved transducer.\u00a0When imaging small body parts, such as a finger, a small transducer (hockey stick) may help. Image guidance for procedures includes the use of ultrasound, fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), or in some cases, MRI. In general, ultrasound is particularly helpful in the guidance of soft tissue procedures such as therapeutic tendon sheath injection, soft tissue biopsy, as well as cyst or abscess aspiration/drainage.\u00a0Ultrasound, CT, and fluoroscopy guidance can be used for both joint aspiration and therapeutic injection. The chosen modality may depend on availability, user expertise, the body part to be treated, and patient body habitus. Advantages to US include lack of ionizing radiation and direct real-time visualization of the needle and surrounding soft tissues during the procedure. During fluoroscopic guidance, the needle is intermittently imaged, and its position is judged only in relation to the associated osseous structures. The involved soft tissue structures must be inferred by knowledge of anatomy. Also, fluoroscopy often requires a contrast agent to verify needle placement as opposed to US, which allows for direct visualization of the needle position. CT is useful for biopsy of osseous structures or therapeutic injection of deep anatomic structures, which can be difficult to visualize with US or palpate on physical examination.", "journal": NaN, "date": "2024", "authors": ["JenniferSchwantes", "Doug W.Byerly"], "doi": null}
